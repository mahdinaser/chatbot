(which was about a week ago sadly lol)\n\nmy tolerance will go almost down to baseline after just one month; but your brain seems to \"remember\" your last tolerance somehow, as your brain has already adapted to 480mg oxy, it is very easy to get back up there.\n\nSo it used to take me 10 years of daily use to get my tolerance that high. a 240mg dose got me well but not high.  If I quit for 1 month,  probably 20mg would get me floating.  But, the next day that 20mg dose would do nothing, I'd need to take 40mg.  And in 10 days, I'd be back up doing 240mg at once.  Then after that 10 days, I am right back with a habit which I can't kick without horiffic wd's.\n\nSo your tolerance goes down very quickly - after 7 days abstinence, a 30% of normal dose for me was too much.   But it goes up just as quick.\n\nI guess you can think of it this way; you can use oxy for 20 years every day constantly. Go through withdrawals and in just 10 days you are back to normal.  But,  it only takes that 10 days to go right back up to your habit dosage again.\n\nIf I can stay clean now I am tempted to buy some naltrexone or something; thinking maybe an opioid antagonist would help reverse what a normal agonist does.", "4295": "That is pretty low.

I've noticed that the vast majority of heavy dose users (\\~1000mg+ oral morphine or \\~667mg+ oral oxycodone equivalent every 1-3 days) who used for at least \\~8-16 months, tend to have a severe permanent tolerance  even after 1-3 years of total abstinence.\n\nA personal friend of mine used to consume roughly \\~400-600mg of oxycodone pseudo-IR (was the old OC 80s that were easily defeated into IR) every \\~2 days or so for roughly 2.5-3.5 years, with several years prior to that including once weekly doses of \\~180-160mg oxycodone pseudo-IR.

Oxy became cheap (UK), so I switched to that. To get roughly the same effect, I needed 3 OC80's. I remember I was using 3 OC80's twice a day before I quit. I was only using this oxycodone for a few months but before that I had been on the massive DHC doses for years, probably at least 5 since I'd moved up from codeine.\n\nI quit for 10 days.  I got more DHC and I then took around 10 tablets, so 300mg.  It was too much and I had to lie down. My opiate niaive \"getting high\" dose would have been 120mg.  So in 10 days, my tolerance had returned to double my first time tolerance.\n\nOf course, after that one dose, I had another dose of 200mg 2 days after- I barely felt anything at all.  I had to take 400mg the next day to get a decent buzz. It only took one week to get back to 840mg giving me a mild buzz.\n\nI only got big into oxycodone (i.e. using it for months at a time instead of just a few weeks when the DHC dried up) this year. So I hope I haven't frazzled my tolerance.\n\nOne thing I have noticed, is before, I'd quit 480mg oxy and return to 800mg DHC, and have no problems (other than day 1 itching)  - 800mg DHC would give me a nice buzz and last for hours.\n\nBut, recently, when I've ran out of OXY,  even 1200mg of DHC is barely keeping me functional and at most for a few hours.  I'm using the same brand oxy (though this time I dissolve it in cola, before I used to crush it up, spoon it in and swallow it).  Could it be messing with my tolerance?\n\nIn a way, I hope my tolerance is permanently raised massively - my main relapse behaviour is because such a small amount gets me so high. When it stops working in a week, it is too late - my habit is back and I need to cluck all over again", "4305": "Yeah that's the kicker there man.  Do you withdraw without it?

Everyone is different . I\u2019ve always had a high tolerance though. Where the average person would start out taking 15mg. I started by taking four of the 30s and four Dilaudids.

Good luck.", "4307": "also since switching to the coke method, the oxy seems much stronger and it seems to last longer too.

And I know man WDing at work blows.", "4311": "I guess the bigger point is if you intend to use daily or near daily, no amount of tolerance \"break\" will do you much of any good, as your tolerance just shoots right back up. If you want to get your tolerance down and keep it there, you can only dose ONE opioid dose (one singe dose, not 24hr of redosing) a maximum of once a week, and in my experience, once a week is definitely often enough to slowly but consistently raise your tolerance back up.\n\nA more realistic dosing frequency is every \\~14 days. IME it took about \\~4.5-6 months of 2x/month dosing for my tolerance to increase to the point where my usual dose to reach a \\~4-6/10 buzz (just \\~20mg hydrocodone or \\~15mg oxycodone at the time, but this was over a decade ago) went from a solid 6-6.5/10 to around a \\~3.5-4/10. Whatever you do, definitely try to keep it to one dose every 10-14 days.\n\nIf you can't maintain the self discipline of dosing no more than once a week,  then you'll definitely ruin your tolerance in no time, and 5-20 years from now you'll look back and hate yourself for dosing opioids daily at low doses, which is the OPPOSITE of what you should be doing to keep tolerance to a minimum.\n\nWith that being said, I'd definitely wait a full 60 days to use if I were you (yes a full 60 days, as a week won't do that much since you were dosing every goddamn day for several months) and keep it to a maximum of once a week until you start noticing significant reduction in euphoria. Once that happens, switch to every 10-14 days.\n\nUsing in this way will delay your eventual spiral into first mental and then eventually physical by up to 5-12 years. It's definitely worth it, as you get pleasant low/mid tolerance highs for several years instead of just a few months. I can promise you right now that if you continue using EVERY SINGLE DAY, even without raising your dose, you will obliterate both your acute AND your permanent tolerance in no time.", "4312": "I was prescribed or I probably would\u2019ve never started", "4313": "Did you eat the dilaudids?", "4314": "Yeah.

They say it's the \"law\" that they can't fill it until the \"day of\" when you are completely out of your medication, but it's not the \"law\"...it's their store policy.  Importantly, it can also vary depending on what type of insurance you have as well.  My first piece of advice to you is if you decide to switch pharmacies, MAKE SURE you let your pain management office know this, as you likely signed some sort of pain contract stating that you will only use one pharmacy to fill your prescriptions at.  So if you change, make sure you let them know before you leave the office...it shouldn't be a big deal, just let them know that you've had bad experiences with Publix and you want to try Walgreens because it is closer to your house or whatever reason you want to give them. The biggest mistake you can make is not telling them.I too am prescribed meds for my chronic pain (oxycodone) and my Doctor, as well as pharmacy (Walgreens) allow me to fill 1-2 days early, specifically so I don't wake up the \"day of\" without any medication and have to wait for the pharmacy to open before I get any pain relief, not to mention starting to feel sick, as I usually take my first dose right at 5:00AM when I wake up...so waiting 4 hours or so for the pharmacy to open, having to leave work, in pain, starting to feel sick, is just borderline stupid.  I get that if you pick up your prescription 2 days early every month that you aquire meds by the end of the year, but picking it up 1 day early is a huge convenience so you don't have to wake up in pain the morning of. If they try to tell you it is federal or state law, they are more than likely full of shit. I don't know every state law, but I'm aware of my state law, as well as federal law governing this...it often comes down to that pharmacy's \"policies\" and what your insurance provider allows. Hope this helps and good luck, OP!", "3807": "Are you paying out of pocket or with insurance? Insurance probably not but possibly you could do it early.

So when you go into see him for your monthly visit, they will run a report and pull up that information.  If you have been going to Publix, and all of a sudden switch to Walgreens, sadly, it can be grounds for termination from that doctor, as there is a huge crackdown with narcotics.

Treat your opiate years as a time of being VERY sick, anything you failed, did wrong etc, don't feel guilty, drug addiction is a LEGITIMATE disease (as is Diabeties Type II, which you can develop), your brain was really undergoing big biological changes and had to adapt to the external opioids.

People who use it say to stick with once a week to avoid tolerance / withdrawal, which might contain more insomnia.\n\nAside from that, you could see a psychiatrist about ambien or off-label quetiapine for your sleep troubles. I take an antipsychotic for other reasons, and it really does help with rest (quetiapine is one). They have scary side effects, but when you're dosed for insomnia, you take less, making the probability of adverse reactions low.\n\nThen there's the standard sleeping pill OTC anywhere - Benadryl. They just repackage it into a blue/black box and charge more, so if you want to try it, buy regular Benadryl. Take 25-100 mg, as little as works. It has a downside of not working forever since you'll become tolerant to it, but it can come in clutch once every few days. I find Benadryl sleep to be very refreshing.\n\nIf you can find some in the streets, Xanax is also nice once in a full moon if you can't sleep. I would recommend it last though since it is its own addictive substance unlike the other recommendations and also causes insomnia during withdrawal.\n\nAs for something you can research, look at medical journals weighing the benefit of things like l-theanine and other supplements on opiate withdrawal / depression / anxiety / whatever you're struggling with.

I used my fear of failure to tell myself I deserved some respite from the pain.. even though the only one inflicting pain on me was myself. \n\nI knew that this career path I'd worked so hard for years for was really just a thin tightrope I walked between being a dope-head on the corner and being an upstanding citizen that people look to with respect. I clung to it like a life-raft. My first semester of medical school, I would show up at my Suboxone appointments dressed all professionally like I'd just left class or clinic. I was just putting on a facade to help myself feel like I was somehow different from these other junkies that were coming in... But I knew it was a facade. I knew I was no better. It came to a point where that line became so thin, that I knew if I didn't reach out for help, I was going to succumb to this sickness and die. \n\nMy doctor who was managing my Suboxone during my first year of medical school agreed to have him and his team come with me to talk to the faculty at my school and set up a plan for a leave of absence. If it weren't for the overwhelming understanding of my school and their facilitating a medical leave from school after first semester, my crash and burn story would've rivaled the Titanic. They really showed pure faith in me and my ability to find my way back to myself, and that's what drove me to an iron fucking conviction that I was going to kick this shit once and for all. \n\nI moved home to be with my parents for 6 months. I did a very steep taper over 10 days (was on 16 mg/day) and went through about 6 straight weeks of a withdrawal depressive state I wouldn't wish on any human being. There was no color in the world. I was constantly in pain. The voice in my head kept telling me I would fail because I was, by fundamental nature, nothing more than a worthless addict. The hours dragged on every day, and every morning I woke up feeling no better. My inner voice taunted me, telling me I was clinging to a career as a physician like a life-raft that would deliver me from having to face that I really was, all along, destined to wind up spending my days hustling up as much money as I could for a hit and that real fulfillment would never be mine.\n\nMy loved ones helped me through that. But there were so many days, 2, 3, 4, months since my last dose.. that I wouldn't like how I felt or I couldn't handle the intensity of all my emotional faculties returning to me like this.. feelings I hadn't felt since I was young. But when the fog lifts, you see all the selfish destruction you've caused to the people who love you and the guilt just eats away at you.\n\nBut I pushed through every fucking day, looking myself in the mirror and reaffirming my choice to find myself again. Here I am, almost 7 months out and... very slowly, mind you... but more days than not now I'm able to feel happiness in a way that I never was able to on opiates. Like a poster above said, sobriety will give you what opiates promised to give you in its warm but deceitful embrace as it leeches everything good out of you. Now, when I'm working rounds in the hospital and I see a pediatric cancer patient's scans come back showing remission or a parent looks me in my eyes and thanks me.. I can viscerally feel the emotion, the fulfillment of knowing I'm on the right path to fulfilling my purpose. And as many days as I come home to my empty apartment and want to pity myself or engage my frustrations that I'm still this far out and having to put in daily, conscious work on changing my psychology.... I'm finally at the point where nothing in this fucking world would make me trade my life as it is now, even if hope and joy and purpose only show themselves fleetingly for now... for a life that's 100% the best opiate high obtainable. 5 minutes of Meaning > 20 years of floating opioid narcosis. \n\nThanks so much to all the friends that have commented here with great advice and encouraging words.

That is really long.\n\nI guess all I'm trying to get out is that the clinic my friend goes to will let you slide on payment on a regular basis so long as they know when they will get paid and you never stiff them. It also gives up to a month of take homes after 5 yrs i think, you get 2 after 5 months and it goes up from there. Plus it's way way cheaper most of the time. I know that's a bitch of a drive but bro ur sick... So it might be worth looking into.", "3493": "Ah oke yeah that sound like an asshole of boss. You got some friends who can lend you 1-2 subs? And them just take half a sub a day? Oh you got nearly the same problem with mdone like me. The nearest clinic is about a hour drive away and for me the problem is too that you need to be about a decade into addiction that a clinic takes you. Plus often you nees other health pronlems that your insurancw covers it. I live in European country where everyone needs a insurance. Plua I wouls lose my driving license and then I couldnt can go to the clinic. A normal doctor isnt allowed to prescribe subs. Which is super stupid cause if you live like me in a rural area it would make sense. And if you want to be a mdone/sub clinic then you need to make extra courses etc and can easily lose your license as doc if some stupid mfucker sells his take homes. Like how should a doctor know if any asshole sells them. Olus the first 3 month you have to go there every day. Before you are allowed to get take homes. Our new drug politician will change that but hasnt dome anything yet in the first half year now. They are all stupid. Ppl who know nothing about drugs will be elected to drug politicians. Then they talk about how much thes will chamge and then happens nothing. Its like that for the last 4 years. The one before said the best comment in an interview. \"Interviewer: Why is alcohol legal? It kills 100 times more ppl than illegal drugs? Politician: Cauae alcohol is legal!!\" Like wtf girl? Whats wrong in your head. Why do you do that job if you know nothing about drugs. She also thought that smoking weed ince will lead you directly to an H addict. What a stupid cunt. I am really looking forward to the new girl and which intelligence she will have... normal Doctors are allowed to give out mdone for cancer patients, but noz for substitution. And also .4mg subs for cancer and if you get mdone/subs you will get an extra licwnae to drive cause addiction is in their eyes no sickness. Its a choice. Yes in some way it really is a choice but at some point you really need help but cant get it. Sorry for the rant but these old bastards making me so sick. I think these old bastards should be addicted just for one week and them they would change a lot. And after one week of addiction they should be dopesick for two weeks straight with the worst symptoms you could have. Such mfucker. Man I am sorry for the rant but I could be happily on mdone and have a great career again but I am stuck in this shit currently cause no one is willing to help me. But I found a great programm now, since I got PTSD and major depression and am bipolar I could go on a few weeks programm for that and they oftwn got ppl with addiction problems (I think its some sort of rehab but not listed as rehab so you wouldnt get treaten everywhere like a junkie) \n\nOne more thing I was in hospital and laid in coma for 4 days, and stayed 3 more days on a extra watching station, onw night on a normal station amd then after lunch the doctors came and told me that I had to go home cause my lunga, heart and kidneys are ok again plus my brain preasure is ok too. I was in hospital 7 days and when they found me at home I was dead. I had no pulse and was not breathing and all that piece of ahit doctor said was\" Better stop doing drugs think of kurt cobain etc. all of them died young because of drugs. \" When I came there I had no drugs in my system. Such mofos. And the old man in my room who got a bit of a pain in his left lwg was already there for 5 weeks. And got 150mg morphine, 70mg oxy and 40mg mdone. I said to him that I got pain too and he gave me his mdone the 2 days I was there cause he didnt liked it and gavw it back every time. Also he gave me once 20mg of oxy. That was a great day. \n\nCause back in 2005 his son was a H addict too and wantes to get off but couldnt get into the mdone programm so he (his dad) went out everyday to pick up mdone for his son so his son could get a job etc. His dad has done this 4 years now his son is completly clean has a wife and 2 kids plus his own construction company. The old man is for me a hero. He helped his son, paid everything and now his son does everything for him. Thats a real man and a real dad. Hw said everyone deserves a second chance and if his son struggles again hw would do the same again. Hw also gave me 1/4 of his fent patch for later at home. I thank him so oftwn and he said I dont have to thank him. He just helps the ones who are good but sont get the help they need. I hope they coule locate his pain and that he can walk normal now again.", "3494": "Yeah it's always got $$$ and no plugs or lots of plugs and no $$$", "3495": "You could use some benadryl instead, then. \nIt should be a lot cheaper than suboxone.", "3496": "What about those payday loans places?

There's a HUGE urban myth that combining opioids and stimulants in general are somehow magically more dangerous than the sum of their parts. In reality, that typically only applies to combining coke or crack with a typical duration opioid like heroin or oxycodone. It's because cocaine is very short lasting (usually only 30-45 minutes maximum), meaning that it wears off and the user potentially overdoses from the heroin alone.\n\nAs long as you're either taking an opioid dose you know for sure is safe for you even without stimulants, or as long as you don't combine coke/crack with common opioids or medium-duration stimulants (like ritalin/focalin) or possibly moderately long duration stimulants (like adderall/dexedrine/desoxyn aka prescription meth/street meth) with possibly suboxone/subutex but especially methadone or full spectrum opium, you should be perfectly fine.", "3273": "You say that you take oxys for pain?

It helped me because when I craved hard, I knew it would be useless to use as I\u2019d feel nothing unless I waited a day or however long for it to wear off, which gave me time to get through the cravings and take my bupe the next day.\n\nMaintenance won\u2019t solve all your problems, but it\u2019s a useful tool that gives you time to address the other issues in your life that keep leading you back to addiction. Think about that... If at all possible, see a counselor or psychologist that specializes in addiction. I know most people hate the idea of it (I did) but it helped me identify and deal with my negative thought processes and helped me find ways to change my own behaviors that I never would have seen on my own.\n\nI have two years clean now, which is far longer than I\u2019ve ever been clean since I was 17.

So say Wed is the day you will be out of dope or need to stop by. You can start the process on Friday or as late as Sunday in my experience. You want to cut up your buprenorphone into small doses. This is very important. I was on the 8mg/2mg Strips.  So just use simple math to get down to a dose of 0.25mg. (If you have the 8mg strips that is equal to 1/32 of a strip). If you cut the strip into 8 pieces and then each piece into quarters it equals 0.25mg. \n\nDay 1:  \n     * Take 0.25mg buprenorphone (suboxone, subs, etc.  It all will work the same).  Wait 20-30 minutes. Take your first dose of dope as usual. Same dose and same time.   You should still feel your dope as usual. \n\n    * Repeat the first step for your 2nd dose of the day. If you need to you can do the same with a 3rd dose. \n\nDay 2:  \n     * Take 0.5mg of bupe. Wait 30 minutes and use your dope. Use a normal amount of dope. \n\n     *Take 0.5 mg of bupe. Wait 30 minutes and take 20% less than your normal dose of dope. \n\n     *May repeat for a 3rd dose of needed. \n\n      * The first dose of this day you might feel slightly diminished results from your dope. By the last dose of this day...you may not feel too much from your dope. This is a good sign that your receptors are becoming saturated with buprenorphone. This is the goal for induction and is a sign that you are safe to continue and stop your dope very soon. \n\nDay 3:\n     *. Take 0.5mg of bupe. 30 minutes later take 20% less than your decreased amount of dope from the day before . \n\n     * 2nd dose take 0.5mg of bupe and 30 minutes later take the same amount of dope as your first dose of the day. \n\n     * 3rd dose...if you have not been experiencing withdrawal symptoms...take 0.75mg of bupe and same dose of dope as before. \n\nDay 4:\n     * Take 0.75mg of bupe and 30 minutes later take 1/4-1/2 of your original, pre-induction amount of dope. \n\n     *Take 1mg of bupe and the same amount of dope from dose 1 of this day. \n\nDay 5:\n     *Take 1mg of bupe. See if you have any worsening symptoms in this time.  If you do NOT don\u2019t take any more dope.  If you do rinse and repeat from the day before and attempt this step on day 6. \n\n     *have dope on hand if needed...but I have never needed it. If no w/d symptoms (nothing worse than what you felt when you woke up....which I never felt any other than some fatigue) flush the rest of your dope or donate it to the needy...I am sure you could get ample addressed on here to mail it to if needed!!  JK of course. \n\n     *I have done this whole process successfully in as few as 2 days...but would err on the side of caution the first time you do it just because we all metabolize and respond differently to medications and such. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have to take any dope you are ready to find your comfortable dose of bupe:\n     * If you need to you can repeat the 1mg at 12 hours after the first dose on the last day (the day you don\u2019t take any dope). I have found that 2mg is usually plenty and makes it easier to do a quick taper if that is your plan...and either way easier to get off of even if you plan to do maintenance. \n\n     * With some of the insane fentanyl analogies you may need a higher dose of buprenorphone, and in that case you can dose every hour (after repeating in 12 hours from the first bupe only dose) until you get to a tolerable level or lack of symptoms.   This titration is to be done at the end of the process once you are off your dope and only taking subs. \n\nBest of luck to you fam!!  \nBlessings!!\n\nEdit:  formatting.", "2610": "if you're doing fetty, this method wont work.", "2611": "If I am understanding what you are saying, you are not describing the Bernese Method.

Keep in mind that September 12th of this year, a little more than a week ago was exactly 10 months that I\u2019ve been into my recovery from Heroin, and I am on Zubsolv for maintenance. \n\nWhile we were at her house and we were smoking bud and she was doing shots and I would shoot her for her, I had picked up a bag of her dope just to see how decent it was, and it actually was brown, which is rare around here, NW suburbs of a very large, midwestern city. \n\nAnyways/ long story short, every time that I hit her, about 13 or so times total in the 2 or 3 days that I had shot her up, I hit each time and didn\u2019t miss a drop. \n\nAnyways, on a certain day of last week, a day or two after she had shot up herself and then I came over and did it for her, she developed an abscess due to her not knowing what the fuck she was doing, and her going in the same spot thinking that was okay.

In my experience subs do better for people whose addictions are a few months, a year or two long but methadone does best for those who\u2019ve been hooked for years in end. Our brains physically change after being exposed to opiates for a prolonged period of time and they will never go back to normal. The kind of thoughts you\u2019re currently having were crippling for me.  Unfortunately we will never just magically stop having these urges and cravings.

Trying hard to not give in to a worse situation.  If I were in that place again where work made me sick like you are now I would get out sooner somehow.   It was for the family but it kind of  ruined the family a lot because stress and illness from stress.  I was there for too long, I finally quit after I got sick from it. If it is going to go nowhere get out. I had kids at home and one in college. I am paying with worse health because of it and worse mental health.  A lot of other stuff happened and life does that sometimes.  So fucking hard to know what to do next,  later I spent  some time with a Buddhist program I found online, I was still drinking a little and taking pain meds but it kept me here and  I should go back.

It was better then talk therapy and they do have program for drug use,  they only take donations so it is free but you give what you can.  I should have stayed with it I might not be in the mess I am in now.  Sometimes we are good at something we hate to do,  I was a good public speaker but it was miserable for me.  My first panic attack took me to the hospital and upstairs to mental health. If we did things right in the first place it would sure help. Not sure I know anyone with out anxiety now because even if you never made a mistake life is harder then it used to be.  I read a paper I found today that was from 1989.  The price of things really was surprising  to me and I was there.  A new car was $10,000 same car now 25,000.  It is definitely harder to get by monetarily and everything is so stressful. They should offer massage at work before you leave to drive home and hand you a cup of coffee or wine and cheese.   I am taking my one ambien and saying my best advice is find another support outside the family that you can sit with or skype with  then make a plan and take your time because there will setbacks.

Once you start banging you very VERY rarely go back. \n\nBut yes you can shoot up and not make consistent track marks. But it takes disciple and skill to be honest. Some people are just better at shooting up than others. The key for me has been understanding how fast scar tissue develops and giving the needle marks time to go away/heal. \"A needle mark is a needle mark\"\n\nFor me it took time and the process sucked and was humiliating. Just like most people I started shooting in the crooks of my arms and when you go on a bender you shoot up multiple times in the same spot, re use needles, and if your starting off you just generally fuck your shit up with misses and improper technique. I definitely had track marks at first and I've had ones lasting months that have eventually gone away. \n\nBut eventually through trial and error most dope heads with any bit of finesse figure out how to reduce/avoid the tracks. But, you can't shoot up every day multiple times a day and not expect track marks. I don't know the \"least amount\" you can shoot up. But, for a couple years off and on I've been doing heroin and when I do heroin I bang it cause why the fuck would I do it any other way? I've done it before and it's arguably the best way to do it. And I usually can keep it to every weekend or every other weekend, friday-sunday/monday. I shoot up 2/3 times in a day max. I use 31 gauge needles and use a new clean every shot. I basically just use my left forearm cause I got a big juicy vein running all the way up/down it. The thing is, a needle mark, is a needle mark.. 31 gauge makes the smallest mark and usually goes away within like a few days I wanna say.. But the marks I make are small as fuck and no one really notices, I know this because I'm around people who are clean but used to use needles, they know their shit.\n\nBut yeah, don't do drugs kids!

When I'm using I shoot up between 4-8 times a day. There are dotted lines going up and down my arms and biceps. Within 8 days of stopping I'm back to wearing a T-shirt around my family. \n\n\nIf you start shooting you'll end up with a favorite spot. Its inevitable that you'll find a place that's easy for you to hit and that you can register consistently. Save this spot for emergencies after you find it. Otherwise, even when the tracks fade, you'll end up with a lot of scar tissue around that area and it'll start to suck to use and the tracks will stand out more and more in that area.\n\n\nBe safe", "1701": "It is possible, but the problem is the easiest veins are the noticeable one.

Are you talking physically, socially, mentally etc.?\n\nThey're both horrible imo. Both withdrawals are horrendous, but alcohol wds can kill you. It's also readily availavle everywhere and legal, making it impossible to avoid triggers. Long-term drinking causes a litany of serious health issues like liver damage. Opiates can also cause health issues depending on your drug and ROA, vein damage, abscesses, etc. You're also more likely to die from accidental overdose from opiates, especially if buying pills or dope on the street.\n\nSo both have terrible downsides. I think the biggest difference to me is what many opiate addicts (not all) do to get their drugs. Of course there's homeless alcoholics spending their only change on booze, or an alcoholic loses their job due to drinking and goes to the liquor store everyday, but it typically doesn't financially destroy you and it's legal. With dope/street pills being illegal and relatively expensive, you get more opiate addicts inevitably getting arrested, having expensive court costs, not working due to felonies (or needing to spend all day getting money/drugs), completely ruining themselves financially, stealing, prostituting, etc. I think more crimes are committed in the pursuit of opiates.\n\nSo I think opiate addiction is sometimes worse because I've seen it fuck more people's lives up in a HUGE way.

Drinking and buying alcohol is legal while dope isn't. Alcoholics can lose their jobs, get DUIs, like you said, both can fuck your life up. But I have not seen as many alcoholics completely ruined financially or doing the things some addicts do to get dope.\n\nIt's illegal to even buy dope and dope/pills can be expensive when your habit grows. Inevitably many addicts get arrested, get felonies, have court costs, lose their jobs, run out of money, and need to come up with $80+ a day rather then $10 or $20. Many end up not even paying their bills, getting payday loans, shoplifting, stealing, scamming, pawning shit, prostituting etc.\n\nObviously both are horrible and can ruin your life, I just disagree that opiates have more \"inward\" consequences than outward.

A majority of people cave, but not every one does. \n\nIf you are able to get you hands on suboxone, I highly suggest switching over to sub. Just use the smallest dose possible to be comfortable, DO NOT use suboxone to get high. If you venture down that path, the w/d\u2019s from suboxone are even worse than heroin/fent.\nJust use the subs for 5-10 days, while obviously tapering the dosage in half or fourths every 2 or 3 days. \n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I did after a year long binge with various different kinds of heroin. Went thru prob 9g BTH, probably 40g-60g of ecp, & a solid 25g-30g of china white that was def fent laced. Started with 2mg or 4mg of suboxone to start I believe. That was the perfect dosage to where I wouldn\u2019t be deathly sick & def not high, I would even be able to go to work. 3 or 4 days of 4mg then after that it was another 3 or 4 days of 2mg. If you can\u2019t handle that big of a \u201cdose jump\u201d, then just drop 1mg every 3-4 days. Suboxone is a life saver if you ask me. Helped me get thru the first week or withdrawals at least 4 separate times. Then I slowly drop the subs and then usually stay sober for a couple months or so & hen usually binge again.

Obviously no one wants to be narcaned or narcan a friend, but given the nature of opioid overdose there is a chance of brain damage, so better safe than sorry I say. If you genuinely can't rouse them or get any kind of response and their breathing is very slow or irregular, stopping and starting, then they're in danger and need medical attention.\n\nAlso, I was told it is safe to administer naloxone to anyone experiencing these symptoms, so if you see someone on the street unresponsive and with shallow or irregular breathing and pinned pupils then it's safe to administer naloxone (for them, not necessarily you, be safe!).

One example they used was some isolated nordic country where real heroin was almost non-existant, so junkies had moved on to IVing buprenorphine pills meant for pain since it was all they could get.

Heroin is cheaper and way easier to source.\n\nAs to why the underworld produces heroin instead of another opioid is because heroin is semi-synthetic, opium is taken from the poppy, morphine is isolated from the opium, and the morphine is converted to diacetyl (heroin) without the need for an advanced lab set up and chemicals, its the most potent easiest thing to make from the poppy besides if they just stopped at morphine (but converting to heroin makes it far more potent and a more desirable high).\n\nAs", "986": "I personally think its portrayed as the king of opioids because:\n\n* It gives a good rush through all ROA's especially IV.

Somehow going from buying pills and dope to paying a doctor hundreds for a script of subs or methadone would change you from an addict into just dependent by your logic?  There is no difference imom\n\nSure you get your dope from a pharmacy but ive met so many people that got hurt bad, got on cpp, then out of nowhere they get cut off.  What would you do if you took your last pill, went to your doctor appointment and either the place was closed with a paper on the door saying \"the doctor got arrested/shut down and sorry for the inconvenience\", or you get inside into a room and the doc comes in and says \"sorry. Heres the numbers for the local methadone clinic. Good luck\" ? \n\nWould you just shrug your shoulders and go home with no meds and be fine with nothing or maybe spend weeks trying to get into another cpp doctor, only to get in and he says hell give you tramadol or 3- 5mg hydrocodone per day?  Youd be sick as fuck for a week then feel like garbage with no energy for months and months without a script\n\nThe last detox i was at there was a ~40year old woman that was in a bad car crash and had full dentures from knocking her teeth out. She got oxy 30s for a long time then out of nowhere the doc gives her the numbers for methadone clinics so she ended up doin dope.\n\nSure opiates work for pain at first, but with longer use at the same dose, all it does is make you feel normal. Now im not trying to put oxy users down, but even with way stronger opiates like opana and heroin dope, after 20 years theres increasingly diminished effects that i could shoot 2 grams of good dope and id still get better pain relief from tylenol/motrin. My tolerance back in 2010 was 40mg opana per day sniffed and one day i was sick and my friends mom had a few bottles of perk5s unused so i took 16 of em and it didnt even stop the wds and that was a decade ago. I just cant see anyone legitimately taking ~100mg of oxycodone per day for 5-10-20+ years and still be affected by that same dose. After a few months of the same dose all it does is get you dope sick wothout it and when you take it all it does is make you feel unsick.\n\nI guess if it makes you feel better to think youre different cause you get it from a pharmacy then go ahead and keep thinking that way, but you said you already take extra doses to feel good so just that already means you like the high from opiates and that your prescribed dose doesnt do much for you anymore.

I also work with clients who are on pain management regiments and focus on helping them manage their pain, depression, anxiety, and cravings to maintain a quality of life. Please keep this in mind as well, opiates decrease our tolerance for pain. Meaning, when we take opiates for a long period of time, what may have been a 5 on a pain scale before the opiates could feel like a 9 while having been on opiates for some time.

What was your experience", "comments": [{"288": "I used to donate plasma at OctaPpasma all the time, and it was usually a pleasant enough experience. The only thing that I didnt like was when they were busy and I had to wait forever till it was my turn, because the actual process took about an hour too. \n\nThey dont drug test you, but you do get a little physical when you first sign up. The first time you donate they send your blood to a lab to test for HIV and a few other things. They also check your vitals everytime and check your plasma levels before hand and if you're too low they tell you to come back the next day. Some people like to go to different places to try to get more money because they only let you donate 2 times a week. They do have you show your arms during the vital check every time and they look for track marks, so if you shoot and have marks they might turn you away. They have a little kiosk with a touch screen computer that you answer the same 20 something questions every time you go. They ask things like if you have been sick since the last visit, been out if the country, gotten a tattoo, paid for sex, live with someone that has HIV, hepatitis, things like that.\n\nThe process isnt too bad. I dont shoot up, but I dont really have a problem with the big ass needle they use. It just takes a while because they take your blood, it runs in a machine that separates the red cells from the plasma, then it sends your red cells back into your arm. It does this probably 5 or six times until the bottle is full of plasma, then there's a bag of saline that it pushes into your vein to kind of rehydrate your blood since they took all that plasma out. Like I said the process takes about an hour. Yoire sitting/laying in a comfy chair thing so you're comfortable. They have TVs and wifi. You're allowed to watch stuff and text on your phone, you just cant talk on your phone. \n\nThe money is decent too. At the place I went to you get $75 for your first donation. After that they have a system where you get $25 on your first visit of the week and $50 on your second. Plus they always have special promotions going on. It's either an extra $20 for your 2nd donation of the week. Or they base it on your total donations for the month and you can only do 8 a month since its max 2x a week. Like an extra $25 on your 6th, $30 on your 7th, and $50 on your 8th. Its Definitely worth it of you have nothing else to do and have spare time. You're also helping to save lives and create new medicines. \n\nUnfortunately they dont give you cash. They give you a prepaid debit card that you have to use and keep track of because they reload the same card everytime you donate. Once the guy in the back scans your plasma bottle the money gets put in your account. It was usually on there by 30 mins after I was done. The card isnt too bad because you can get cash back with it. I would go to publix and buy a soda then get the rest of the $ in cash back since you can pick exact amounts of cash back at publix. \n\nSorry for the book I just wrote. Lol.
