19,How long would a gram of (high grade) heroin last a newbie opiate user?,"Run out of nasal decongestants, eh?

Nevertheless, approximately 16 days assuming standard posology and route of administration. Which is normally 10mg Q4H IM.

21,"16 days off a gram?  You’re the “doctor”, but there has never been a time a gram would last me 16 days.  Continuous use with no tolerance?  3-5 days.","10mg IM Q4H is standard posology for chronic pain when treated with diacetylmorphine. 1000mg in a gram, 60mg a day. 1000 divided by 60 = 16 days. 

That would maintain a reduced nociceptive response for the entire period. Which is after all, the point of opioid analgesia I suppose. 

Hence why I mentioned “standard posology” in one of its approved indications (chronic pain). 

If one were abusing it, it’s entirely possible that it would last a shorter period of time. Incidentally, I was being exceedingly generous with the dose. 5-10mg is usual. So I thought I’d be nice and give 10 as opposed to 5mg. 

But that’s because I’m nice.

Obviously YMMV."

33,Have any of you had any noticeable effects on your hair while on opiates? This will really only be applicable to guys that were using chronically at some point.,"Man, the only thing that happened to my hair while on dope is that I didn’t cut it.  The rest of my body got rat fucked, though."

 Not being transformed by it is a different thing."

39,How spaced out does your heroin use have to be not to be dependent on and effected by heroin?,"Well? To be honest? The only safe spacing between doses as to not get hooked is from birth to death.. lol which means, never use it and you do not have to worry.. I know thats not reality as we are addicts and that is not how we operate.  Just making a joke.

To avoid dependency and tolerance,  you really should try to keep your chipping down to once per week or less.. preferably less. The more frequently you use,  the easier it is to make excuses and exceptions. I did it twice in a row last week and was fine, so this week maybe I can get away with three days in a row... from there it just keeps on going until you wake up one day and see that you're using every damned day and can no longer stop without  withdrawal."
40,How spaced out does your heroin use have to be not to be dependent on and effected by heroin?,I usually would go 2 days of using and 3 or 4 days clean to avoid dependency. But that’s just me. Everyone is different. See if that works.

52,2 weeks of use enough to create depandance?,"Personally, I always have withdrawal symptoms after three or more days of use.

53,2 weeks of use enough to create depandance?,"It could be some physical dependence, it’s sounds like you were on a pretty high dose but usually it takes a while longer than that to have withdrawal symptoms. Your symptoms also sound like a cold or flu, perhaps you were exposed to something while you were in the hospital? 

I would stop with the kratom, it might be what is causing  your symptoms. Plus adding an unregulated substance to your recovery from surgery is probably not the best idea when your body is trying hard to heal.

It sounds like you have good awareness of the dangers of what could happen, just continue to be aware and take care of yourself."

As you can see what he expressed as this two symptoms are barley considered withdrawal symptoms. 

I don’t think that it’s safe to tell a perfect stranger that has given us a 2 sentence summary of his symptoms that he is definitely in withdrawal. 

We can have different opinions but I don’t think calling my feedback false is fair to me or the OP."

122,"those of you who have firsthand experience with cotton fever, what was your experience like?","It's true. You'll know. You might not immediately realize that's what's going on the first time, but it's not something you can get confused with other things. 

Think of how intense the feeling of getting Precip WD from IV bupe is. Then switch the feeling in your bones from ice cold to burning hot. Thats the best way I can explain it

Basically what happens is: you do a shot, and 15-60min later, you get a SUPER high fever, shaking hands, and the most painful, soul crushing feeling of discomfort in your body that you've ever had. The worst of it lasts for an hour or so, but you'll be weak and frail for the rest of the day. 


I thought I was dying. Even during the other  times I've had it, and knew what it was, I was rolling on the floor screaming in pain, barely able to speak coherently."
123,"those of you who have firsthand experience with cotton fever, what was your experience like?","You will know. For me personally, it was always a sudden onset of chills with a fever. I'd have to sit in a hot shower for like an hour because i could NOT get warm. My skin would hurt to touch or move. Oh and I would feel nauseated as hell for about an hour or 2 until it passed.i saw one guy though who got it while at my house and he couldn't get off the couch for 2 days."
124,"You will know. For me personally, it was always a sudden onset of chills with a fever. I'd have to sit in a hot shower for like an hour because i could NOT get warm. My skin would hurt to touch or move. Oh and I would feel nauseated as hell for about an hour or 2 until it passed.i saw one guy though who got it while at my house and he couldn't get off the couch for 2 days.",I think this is a good description of what cotton fever is like. I would always get super achey. Like a head cold times 10.
125,"those of you who have firsthand experience with cotton fever, what was your experience like?","Shivers, sometimes vomiting, I've had chest pains before too. I usually willk pass out after a while. It sucks but it goes away in a couple of hours. WD and parcipitated withdrawal is way worse."
126,"those of you who have firsthand experience with cotton fever, what was your experience like?","My friend just got this for her first time two nights ago and she's been in the game for 7years.

I've had it two times both in my first two years of the lifestyle at that point only doing D's no dope. I remember vividly the second time I had used the cotton a few hours prior and it was still moist with wash from the pills. I only had a little more so I thought to see if id get more high to reuse the cotton. Big mistake. It last 4 to 6 hours usually but by then i can finally sleep. You start shaking and your teeth chattering. You're freezing with blankets and your temp is hot. My fever got so bad that I started talking delusional with small hallucinations.  I always hear if you do another shot you will be better but I didnt have more.

Luckily its like 5 years later and I haven't had it again. I usually  reuse my same cotton with my 3x daily shot of dope and ive been good so far. I need to stop risking it.

I dont wish it on my enemy"
127,"those of you who have firsthand experience with cotton fever, what was your experience like?","I legit thought I was dying. Not like “ugh I’m in withdrawals” kind of way, like a “go wake up family to take me to the hospital” kind of thing. I had 8 blankets piled on me and I was still shivering, I was holding my head because my brain felt like it was throbbing And extremely painful, sweating, puking. Eventually just lost consciousness sleeping in my moms bed as she watched me. It was scary."
128,"those of you who have firsthand experience with cotton fever, what was your experience like?",Yep what the guy above me said. You’ll be feeling fine then all of a sudden you’ll get super cold feeling from the fever and you will shake through your bones and get no comfort. A particularly bad one for me had my brain feeling like it was being stabbed with knives from every direction and I ended up vomiting so severely I could barely stand up. It was horrible and ever since I’ve been paranoid about having endocarditis or some sort of blood disease. Moral of the story is don’t try to rinse cottons that have fallen behind your table and been on the floor for months. Pretty sure that night was my rock bottom.
129,"those of you who have firsthand experience with cotton fever, what was your experience like?",The onset of the fever and the shaking and the general feeling of death from cotton fever is unmistakeable after the first time you get it. You’ll know it when you feel it.
130,How long for my tolerance to get down?,"I've gone a month and my tolerance didn't seem to go down much.  I take methadone for pain.  I think it depends on the person and the opiate they use.  If it's short acting opiate you usually take, maybe it will go down faster.  Tolerance is a bitch and it seems to stick around for the long haul, at least for me."

Do you think that means if I take some once I’ll throw myself right back into withdrawal
132,Thanks for the reply. Do you think that means if I take some once I’ll throw myself right back into withdrawal,"Oh yeah, I think there is a good chance you could get wd.  It may not be as intense or long lasting but I think it could still be awful."
133,How long for my tolerance to get down?,The longer you wait the better it will be id go for a month if possible 👍🏼
134,The longer you wait the better it will be id go for a month if possible 👍🏼,Thanks! So if I were to take some today I’ll probably have withdrawal tomorrow if I understand it right?
135,Thanks! So if I were to take some today I’ll probably have withdrawal tomorrow if I understand it right?,"I took about a week break from 200ish and 50 got me blasted but I woke up in cold sweats the next day. Back at it for 3 days now so probably, wait longer."
136,How long for my tolerance to get down?,I was only up to 90-120 a day at most but after 2 weeks clean i noticed 30-60 was a nice dose not necessarily catching a nod or blasted or anything but a  noticeable difference
137,Suboxone Dependency?,12 days
138,12 days,Thank you!
139,Thank you!,"that is just the manufacturer or basic info i read one time..i think that is the best use of bupe.
Very short term, with tapering after you are stabilized."
140,Suboxone Dependency?,r/suboxone
141,Suboxone Dependency?,Mental dependency can happen well before you ever take a pill.
142,Suboxone Dependency?,"I would say there’s little mental dependency with suboxone once you get to a stable dose you should always just be feeling normal never high. 

Physical is a bitch tho but don’t rush it. It’s better to stay on subs and slowly taper than rush and go back to dope or whatever"
143,Suboxone Dependency?,"If you have been taking opiates and are now taking suboxone you have switched your physical dependency to Suboxone which is also an opiate. The reason suboxone is a better alternative is because it’s legal, you get a steady dose by taking it daily and don’t have to suffer from withdrawals and helps with cravings. As far a mental dependency If you look up Opioid dependency DSM5 you will see that when you are stable on suboxone you no longer meet criteria for opioid dependence because you are not doing all the things you do when taking street drugs."
144,Suboxone Dependency?,Different for everybody. If I use for everyday for a week I am no doubt dependant.
145,Real-talk has anyone actually gotten clean 3 years + after going to rehab just once?,Dude if u want it bad enough nothing will stop u from getting clean likewise nothing will stop u from using if u want to so really its up to you
146,Dude if u want it bad enough nothing will stop u from getting clean likewise nothing will stop u from using if u want to so really its up to you,"That's true man.

147,Real-talk has anyone actually gotten clean 3 years + after going to rehab just once?,"Never been to rehab, always got myself off shit. But my brother has been a ton of times. But he just loves gear... Like he was born to do it!

I think it's more a state of mind. Learn the shit they teach you and use those tools in the real world to stop yourself using. Most people end up in rehab and don't want to stop(in my experience, the people I know who've gone) because other people are wanting them to go there and sort their shit out. But if you're going for yourself and REALLY want to quit, you'll take on what they teach you and apply it outside of rehab. Whereas, most the people I know, day 1 out and they're with their old mates looking for gear... Bad time for a relapse and possible OD.

If rehab is going to work for you, put in 100 percent!! Only you know if it's going to work when you arrive and start all the shit they do.

Wishing you all the luck, dude! Get clean, get your shit together and your life back!

Edit: You'll know within 3 weeks if it's for you. Then get the rents to front some cash for more time."

And I'm only close to 4 weeks clean! I know in my heart I'm not using again, I can't afford to... Its not practical and I WILL lose everyone around me.

And all you can do, is to try your best. But your best will reflect on how bad you want to keep your shit together!

Me, I've put in place that my Mrs can piss test me(I do them if she forgets) every 2 days. You can't get opiates out in two days from your system. I've made it so I can't fuck up. She didn't ask, but I keep every reciept and make sure I can account for every penny to show her I mean it this time! It's not for her benefit, as such, but for mine. It makes me want to NOT use.

Give 100 percent, no matter what and you can get away from that shit, make your own highs!"
150,Real-talk has anyone actually gotten clean 3 years + after going to rehab just once?,It's not about the rehab & if it works - it's all about YOU and you truly wanting to stop. I went to 3 rehabs and relapsed each time within a few weeks but looking back I went to these rehabs for my family & other people. I wasn't truly ready to stop. The final rehab I went to was actually because I wanted to go and today Im close to 10 years being clean. So you have to ask yourself if your truly wanting to stop and stay clean

152,Real-talk has anyone actually gotten clean 3 years + after going to rehab just once?,It’s about wanting it. Rehab just gives you enough time away from it so you can think clearly.
153,Real-talk has anyone actually gotten clean 3 years + after going to rehab just once?,"A lot of people have gotten clean WITHOUT rehab, some found hobbies, others jesus, others a great job they loved, whatever. I think the trick is wanting it, personally I'm not a fan of sobriety but i suffer from personality disorders that make recovery complex. Don't forget rehabs are full of people like me, so the numbers are tweaked (pun intended). 

If you want recovery stats from single or poly addictions, the web is full of them, but don't expect good news."
154,Real-talk has anyone actually gotten clean 3 years + after going to rehab just once?,Kratom and my kids did it for me.
155,Real-talk has anyone actually gotten clean 3 years + after going to rehab just once?,"You said it yourself “you don’t WANT too, it’s more because you feel that you HAVE too because you’re going to lose everything so that right there shows that your not doing it for YOU which 99% of the time leads to relapse but who’s to say you can’t be that 1% that makes it? Is your desire to stop using more important now because you don’t want to lose everything? There needs to be some part of YOU that wants this. Whether it’s to be a better person for yourself at the end of the day but it can’t just be for your parents or your partner etc. it has to be for you and the future you."
156,Real-talk has anyone actually gotten clean 3 years + after going to rehab just once?,It's going to be you and what you put into it. I've known people with multiple years who only went once and I've known people who went 16+ times before they got it. And I've known people who never went at all.

long version: Opiates plus benzos is the only combo that ever almost took my life unintentionally. No one here cannot judge your tolerance, nor do we know what you ate or when (barely matters with benzos but still), if your dope is real, or if you are telling the whole truth (absent minded compulsive redosing is benzo's specialty, and you may not be aware of it), or if you've been drinking too, etc, etc.... so you get it, it's impossible to answer your question. The fact that you're asking it is bad news because if this was a common thing for you, you wouldn't be asking about it.... I'd thread very carefully here."

They seem to last so long.  I’ve been prescribed Xanax for 18 years, 3mg daily, but I get 10mg Valiums (60 a month) from my friend who doesn’t take them, but gets prescribed.  Back in the early 2000s when docs handed them out like candy, I was getting the 2mg klonopin white cut outs for $2 a piece from my old head friend who had epilepsy and got 200 a month.  He would sell me half every month, I was in heaven.  I love those fuckers.  I would say my tolerance is just from taking them daily, but not going hard every day with them.  Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had my days when I wake up and don’t remember a fuckin thing.  I’m 40 now, and I’ve fully accepted the fact that I’ll be on them for life, which is fine.  That’s hilarious that the anesthesiologist said that, and you know he’s seen some people with high tolerances.

Public warning to new friends: once you switch to dope you can't go back to pills usually. 

To answer OP: I feel good, not nodding but I have euphoria. Just kinda sleeping on and off before I go work overnight at the hospital. I should save what I have but theres always the redose desire when you are stocked up. Oh and my DB is in my drive way as I hit submit right now for me to get more, gotta run!"
204,UGH. histamine reaction?,I can only use my legs at this point and yes it's not as good as hitting your arms. I hit in my leg than lie on my back for about a minute to get the blood to go to my brain with gravity. This helps but still arms are better for a rush the blood flows slower in your legs and takes longer to get to your head and it's farther so it's more dilute when it gets there. Damb I miss my big old faithful in my arm from way back. Have you tried an antihistamine half hour to an hour before? Sometimes in your legs if you shoot to fast and don't lay back the shot goes down towards your feet and sort of price burns? Not histamine but feels similar
205,UGH. histamine reaction?,Well I Don't shoot in my arms and mostly use my legs and no the rush isn't as instant but if it's good it's good and I feel it.i still get the histamine reaction from it though sometimes. I usually get the no matter where I go.

That was my entire delima, my doctor made it affordable for my pain managment by only requiring an office visit every 6 months, so all I had was price of script and methadone is dirt cheap. So he suddenly retires and I'm screwed, no insurance, couldn't afford pain mgt. Doctors at their 5-800 visit, and at that time I couldn't afford methadone clinics even if I did find one to take me.

224,Do you think 30 mg would be enough?,[deleted]
225,[deleted],So you telling me 8m bupe=160mg oxy I can easily eat 8mg bupe but if I eat 45-60mg of oxy I'm high asf and I don't use daily only like every other week the bupe was given to me because a friend know I suffer with chronic pain but I felt like I could handle 12mg bupe why is this
226,If I was taking 2.9 mg bupe and then took a 30 mg oxy 3 days later would the oxy get me high?,You'll get high. How high depends fairly significantly on how long you've been consistently taking bupe. Less than a month you should be pretty set.
227,If I was taking 2.9 mg bupe and then took a 30 mg oxy 3 days later would the oxy get me high?,It takes atleast (30) days in my experience  (been on subs for (5) years on and off). The half life of buprenorphine is long and as you know is very potent. So (15)mg oxy would be useless less than a week out from taking buprenorphine. You may feel (30)mg but I promise the experience will be lack luster as buprenorphine fucks your tolerance up for a while especially if you have been on maintenance for months or years and at a high dose.

241,Signing Myself up for Medical Detox: What to Expect?,"1. Look into using psilocybin to cure your cluster headaches. Many, many anecdotal reports say that 1 dose of psilocybin per month can 100% cure cluster headaches. The people who hate tripping generally lay in bed with the lights off for the duration of the trip and just ride it out (might consider taking a benzo as well to curb the psychedelic effects). 

2. The W/D’s. 40mg per day is not a high dose, but 5 years straight is a pretty significant length of time. Here’s what I’d expect: diarrhea, headaches, insomnia, mild anxiety, mild sweating, sneezing, lethargy, dysphoria. Take Imodium for the diarrhea, Excedrin for the headaches, and you need something for sleep too. Ambien or Seroquel would be best... benzos are great for withdrawal as well- help a lot with sleep and anxiety (Valium is preferable, but Xanax will also work)

You’re going to be pretty uncomfortable for about 2 weeks. But much of the W/D process is mental (especially with lower dosages), and it sounds like you’re in a good place mentally. You’ll be 100% after a month, and at that point it’s just a matter of not giving in to cravings. 

Good luck, you can do it!"

I used subs the day of the surgery and when I came to on the operating table I was literally in excruciating agony. I was begging for more morphine to whatever they had given me and they’re like we’ve already given u dilaudid 3 times we can’t give u anymore. 

I’m like do  u mfers not understand that I can’t feel the medicine and u just need to give me more? They ended up getting an anesthesiologist in there to do a SECOND nerve block on my leg. Which went on to cause me permanent nerve damage."

299,Fentanyl long term effects on the brain and body research?,"Are you on any antidepressants?  I did an outpatient detox about a year ago and the doctor was talking about this subject of the body not releasing enough dopamine when coming off of opiates.  He prescribed lexapro and said it would help with it and had me on it for a few months after and then said I could stop taking it cause after a few months of not using your body’s dopamine levels will get back to normal.  I wouldn’t really recommend this but if it’s becoming unbearable you could try taking adderall which would help.  You’re probably aware of this but if you take it consistently then your body will become dependent on it for the dopamine and you’ll be in the same boat when you stop taking it.  I’ll end this with I’m not a doctor or pharmacist so this could be a completely terrible idea in terms of its effects on the body it’s natural production of chemicals but has been helpful for me.  When I’m not using I take suboxone, Zoloft, adderall, and seroquel all prescribed by my doctor and the course of treatment she had me on

The other option is just give it time, you used for over a year and you now have 30 days clean which is amazing but you can’t expect your body to be completely back to normal after the length of time you used for.  From what I understand opiates are one of the drugs that don’t cause any long term permanent damage to your body."

And no problem","I’m not sure honestly, as I’ve never had it tested. Which for someone who’s used for so long, I probably should look into... I’ve always justified not testing because I’ve been seeing the same guy for about 7 years and it’s always been fairly consistent in size, color and smell- except when fent got huge and then I saw a color change and a taste/smell change from the straight dope to a mix with fent. But since that one time, it’s always been very consistent. As I type this out it sounds extremely naive of me and I’m probably extremely lucky I’ve never OD’d...

ANYWAY, I’ll definitely look into test kits... but I’m certain it’s a mix because of drug tests I’ve taken pop for both opiates and fent. But what is analogue? I’ve never seen that term before."
346,Hair loss?,"When I switched to fent I started losing a LOT of hair. Luckily I have extremely thick hair, so you can't tell. But I never had that problem with other opiates. I think it also had to do with being pretty malnourished when I was using the fent."

But on a budget anything from the drugstore will help.

What if he was meeting someone else and I was screwed? What if by chance he didn't answer in time? I don't have to worry about that at the clinic. I know as long as I show up, I get what I need. And I can do it mostly on my schedule. I don't have to ask ""Hey can I come by and dose?"" I do have to wake up extra early now so I can go before work, but it's still better.

I’m pretty much an open book especially if my experience can help someone else. They said they start everyone at 30mg for the first day then go up from there. A doctor spoke with me and he said my plan was based on two things. 

First how much and how long I had been doing the fentanyl. Which compared to others wasn’t much or long. I had been doing the powder maybe one month and only up to two points in a day, never more. Before that I was doing usually two pressed M Boxes a day since around June of this year. I started using oxycodone daily September 2018 up until June when I switched. So that was the first factor. 

Second was I told him that I refused to stay on methadone longer than one year before starting to taper and that I didn’t want to make it any harder than necessary. So he recommended that on day two we up me to just 40 mg and see if we can keep me there. 

Wednesday I woke up having a panic attack (or maybe it was Thursday now I can’t keep track, but regardless). They suggested I go up to 50 mg but I knew that if I could just get through the first week and not go up, those strong initial withdrawal symptoms would subside and 40 mg should suffice. And I was correct.

Yesterday was a much better day and today so far I feel really good. I’m combining methadone with meetings and self care so I’m sure it’s a combo effect. But I’m really glad I didn’t go up to 50 mg just to get through the first rough days. 

I’m not sure why or how people get up to such a high dose. It does seem to effect some people differently. I used to take it illicitly back in 2013. I would take 30 mg approximately a day and I remember all I did was sleep. But I had no prior opiate addiction at the time. Because now at 40 mg I feel productive, motivated and just generally “normal”. I’m just as curious to know what causes it to react so differently, even in the same person. I’m sure with anything it has a lot to do with circumstance, physiology, genetics perhaps, tolerance I’m sure, etc. 

They did tell me there’s no magic dose that works for everyone. I wonder if some people who get up to such a high dosage are trying to chase a high hoping they’ll somehow get there or if they just used so heavily that their dose was upped that high early on in the program to fight withdrawal symptoms and then they just kept them there instead of tapering to a lower dose once out of withdrawal from whatever opiate was their DOC. I hope that makes sense what I’m trying to explain lol! 

Anyway sorry I totally rambled there! My point was those two factors determined my 40 mg dose. At 90 days we are going to see if I feel ready to taper. If not then reevaluate on a monthly basis after that. I’m hoping if I stay on track I can be off sooner than later. 

I’m really happy for your friends and that they’ve found success in the program! I’m seriously so grateful for it."
356,Hair loss?,"Maybe it’s the stress from being a dope fiend?  I’ve never heard of anyone losing hair from Heroin before.

366,Grapefruit juice and oxy?,"The furanocoumarins in white grapefruit juice can inhibit Cytochrome P450 3A4 the enzyme that (along with 2D6) is responsible for metabolising oxycodone. 

From what I can recall, it’s not the sort of thing you can just take a glass of juice when you dose. It takes drinking a few glasses worth of WGFJ for several days to experience a maximal response. 

I don’t believe the studies reported any increase in subjective euphoria, or an increase in antinociceptive effects (analgesia) for a given dose, compared to placebo (water). There was also a greater formation of the active metabolite, oxymorphone. But I may be wrong on that. It has modest effects on peak plasma levels and also slightly prolongs elimination half life. 

Don’t take it as gospel. I reckon you’d be better off taking slightly more oxycodone. I figure this method is better for making the most of a large dose of oxycodone, rather than trying to stretch a small one. 

Good luck with everything and take care."

394,Dope with xanax side effects??,"The jello thing I used to get with IV H, the other stuff doesn’t sound like it at all."
395,how long does this withdrawal symptom usually last?,"You shouldn't be WDing at least acutely from H or Fent for 2 weeks. If your still having explosive diarrhea 2 weeks later, the dope could have been masking an already ongoing issue and you should get checked out. Most acute symptoms last 4-5 days, monitor it and eat fiber and stay hydrated, if it is still continuing see a Dr"
396,how long does this withdrawal symptom usually last?,Are you on lope?
397,Are you on lope?,i’ve been taking it less than daily at the recommended dose. it’s not unbearable but every once in a while i just need a break.

404,Periphery edema in feet after nodding out/sleeping in chair?,"Edema generally happens when venous return from the lower extremity is not sufficient. Which is why when you elevate your feet eventually it re absorbs ( Gravity returns the fluid to circulation). I would go see your primary care physician about it. It's not normal to get edema/swelling if you're sitting in a normal position. Unless you got stuck like that, not moving at all, for a very extended period?"

Honestly if you work an office job, it's probably as much that at it as it is you falling asleep in the chair. You probably sit a lot, and then when you sit like that for a few hours without moving at all the liquid pools. And then when you're up and moving the muscles contract, and thats what pushes things back where they should be. I would so go get checked out just in case. You can tell them that it happens when you sit in one position for too long which is totally true. You don't have to mention the nodding off part because I really don't think that has much to do with it.  Unless you're an iv user in your lower extremities?"

410,As in not having enough sodium? I read also on here someone saying the cure for this is Potassium Chloride supplements daily.

Like I literally wouldn’t actually get into bed for days at a time and I would notice on the 2nd or 3rd day that my feet would be swollen as shit from all the sitting & standing & never actually laying down. 1 good night of actual sleep in a bed would take care of it."
412,Periphery edema in feet after nodding out/sleeping in chair?,"Used to happen to me a few years ago when I first started doing dope, and seemed to be worse during the summer. Standing / having your feet not elevated def made it worse. I have no idea if dope had something to do with it or not bc I haven’t had it happen that bad for a couple years, though I noticed it very slightly this past summer. When it first started and was bad, it was also around the time I randomly developed high blood pressure and didn’t know, so that being uncontrolled could have played a part in it too."

425,How long should I wait to take my Vicodin after taking Xanax?,If you have a tolerance I would take 4 to 6 hydros and 1 to 1.5mg xanax but start low and some people really like the benzo buzz with hydro I do not I before to take the benzos on the come down easier to sleep

The problem is that it’s hard to keep it to weekends because you feel great on them. So then in a couple weeks you think “I feel crappy today so I’ll just take it today for work too” and then on and on. Best of luck to you and I hope you are able to stick to a schedule. Never more than 3 days in a row.

513,Oxy withdrawal?,"I disagree with the ""it will lead to H"" theory.  I know it has happened to a very high percentage of people, I watched it happen to two of my brothers but it doesn't have to be that way. I've been using oxy for 10 years, Not once have I wanted to get H not even during my worse withdrawals and I've been in some pretty tight jams with barely any cash withdrawing bad and H was offered for free,  I always chose to withdraw instead. Maybe it's because I knew it wasn't pure, im sure if I had the chance to try real pure china or pharma H I would. But the fent bullshit that is sold now doesn't seem worth it, I would choose withdraw any day of the week before I used today's version of ""H"". I've always hated street drugs. Guess I'm just a puss, cause if  I don't know for a 100 percent that it came from a pharmacist it's not going in my body.

523,will 5mg of oxy 2-3 days a week cause withdraws?,"I would suggest talking to your doctor about what you’ve noticed. He may be able to suggest a medication that similarly raises dopamine levels without the high and addictive nature. Or, he may prescribe you a low dose of daily opiates and monitor you for addiction. Either way, I think you should try to find a legal, medical route, instead of rationing black market pills or relying on dopaminergic activities alone, since you can’t constantly be doing something"

525,Benzos with my morphine xr?,"Obviously, it wont kill you right off the bat most of the time, but it's just a dangerous combination. What's so hard to understand about that. People mix them all the time and dont die, people do fent all the time and dont die, but mixing benzos and opiates increase the risk of Oding a lot. I'm not a doctor, so I cant tell you exactly why, but I can tell you its dangerous. 

If no one here wants to advise you to mix them, then just take that advise and do whatever you want with it. Most of the people here will tell you it's a bad idea for a reason. You can be mad at that all you want, but that's not going to change their mind. Just do whatever you want to do and leave the attitude at the door. We are just trying to give you the safest advice and you dont want to hear it, so why are you even asking? 

The only I came close to an OD myself was one of the few times I mixed oxy and xanax. I passed out sitting on my patio chair outside and woke up 4 hours later. I lost the use of my right hand for almost 2 months because of the way I had my arm pinned under me against the chair. I didn't even do more oxy than I normally would, but I mixed it with xanax. My body would have normaly woke me up because of the pain, but the benzo/oxy combo kept me asleep. 

It might not kill you straight up but it's a lot more dangerous than just doing opiates. That's all anyone can tell you. Be mad about it all you want. You're obviously gonna do whatever you want to do. Best of luck"

That was really the  only time I can remember that I had xanax and oxy at the same time in my possession and did them both. It was scary. I cook in a kitchen for 65+hours a week for a living, and losing the ability to grasp with my dominant hand really scared me. Luckily I slowly regained the ability over 6 to 8 weeks. 

In reality that could happen to someone who was only using opiates, or only using benzos. But it was the only time I've ever fell out/passed out like that. I've done way more oxy at a time than I did that night. I've never passed out on a chair in my front porch on a winter night until that night. I put a football under my tongue on the way home from work, started feeling it when I pulled up. I sniffed a 15mg oxy in my car, I had done a few more earlier in the night, got out and finished a cig on my porch before going inside. That's when I woke up at like 5am, freezing, and not being able to use my hand. I thoug bth it was just asleep so I went to bed. I woke up the next morning and still couldn't use my hand.

For me the pain felt like falling hard on your knees on top of a sharp rock. The great thing though was that I went through a devastating car wreck the year before and was seriously injured, the knee pain didn't terrify me. 

For a person having no scope of reference the pain is pretty significant but it isn't off the charts. To me its laughable to compare it to natural childbirth but to each their own. 

You can use Kratom when ever, I would use a bit with your opiate doses to get used to taking it. It's not a great pain control device for sharp pain though, so I'm afraid you won't see the relief you are hoping for. Tylenol is going to be your best bet, that and ice."

Not sure how I'd describe the general feeling but when I get to the end of current flexion range it it still feels like the incision and probably the rest of my knee is going to rip open. I haven't had any pain quite like this before but my deep depression/existential crisis from the past couple years was good prep for the mental battle of it lol.

Well I'm not sure how it sounded but I wasn't comparing the two as if they're very similar, more just meant that even someone whose personal, experiential understanding of pain levels includes natural childbirth still says it's no joke. I've heard people say some procedures are like nothing after childbirth so I always thought it was at least somewhat commonly used as a general marker to compare to for pain, perhaps even most commonly for things that are really nowhere near as painful. I.e. ""root canals aren't shit now after I had my children.""

Really? I feel like I had decent success using it after an injury once before with similar, sharp pain, though it was milder, and everyone reacts a bit differently too. I'm also making some CBD/THC lotion which will be my real front line against pain, just can't quite use it very well yet because of the dressing on the incision. I use kratom on occasion anyways though so I figured it would help get me through a couple days til I can start applying the lotion better and help make sure I don't struggle with getting off the prescription. I'd been getting headaches sometimes as my doses were wearing off for the past couple days so I was concerned about rebound pain. Last dose of meds wore off a bit over an hour ago though and I took a light dose then and I'm feeling good so far. Appreciate the reply!

Edit: got the tylenol on deck too though lol thanks"
560,How long after my last opiate dose should I wait to take my first kratom dose?,"That's the way I used to do it. So however long you normally get relief from your pain meds, that's how long you should wait. It's harder going the other way, kratom is more unpredictable with how long its duration is so I'm never sure how long to wait after kratom to dose my pain pills"
561,How long after my last opiate dose should I wait to take my first kratom dose?,Your good to take the kratom anytime since you won't experience precipitated withdrawals. Might not get great relief if other opioids are present in your system. I would taper the mud-water as quick as possible as it's addictive in it's own right.
562,How long after my last opiate dose should I wait to take my first kratom dose?,Yea that’s what I would do.  How bad is the pain with that.  I was scheduled to get it Oct 11 but my family wanted me to use no painkillers and I got pissed and canceled my surgery and ended up relapsing on fentanyl lmao.   Just trying to see if you think it’s doable with only ibuprofen

Just trying to see if you think it’s doable with only ibuprofen,"Well, unfortunately you can't use ibuprofen (or any NSAIDs) with it, lol. They hinder the healing process if I understand correctly. You can use tylenol but I'm not sure how much help it would be on it's own. I had built up a pretty high expectation for serious pain and it's met that without being exceeding it tremendously, which is just to say I think having a realistic expectation and not being caught off guard by it helped. But it is definitely seriously painful. Even women who've given birth with no analgesic generally still say it's very serious pain. But many people report only using the opiates for the first day or two because they made them sick or otherwise just didn't like them and they get through it alright. That's how a friend of mine was. I'll let you know how well the kratom helps though"
564,Does methadone make your pupils small?,"it does (as do all opiates), but it's less pronounced when on a regular dose, due to the above-24hr halflife a certain amount of homeostasis is reached"
565,Does methadone make your pupils small?,"I am on a 40mg dose daily and the first hour or so after taking it my pupils are smaller than normal, but nowhere near as pinned as when I take fent. It's now been about 4 hours since I dosed and my pupils look pretty normal. My SO can tell the difference in my pupils when I take fent vs when I take methadone."
566,Smoking dilaudids?,"Don’t bother. Almost a total waste. Either smoke them or, no meme, boof them. Boofing them is second best to IV.

If boofing use a needle less syringe and mix it up into water like you would an actual shot, don’t just shove the pill up ur ass. Also make sure you don’t have a big turd sitting there waiting to absorb it before your rectum membrane can lol."

Fentanyl has taken over the game practically everywhere. Even in major US heroin cities, most of the “heroin” is at most a tiny amount of heroin and then fentanyl or a fentanyl analogue and some cut repressed together. It’s crazy, although from a ROI (Return On Investment) stand point, it makes complete sense.  Even smaller dealers can get there hands on a gram of fentanyl for example for maybe a few thousand and turn it into like 100,000$ worth of “heroin”, being the same potency per gram as heroin would be. (Albeit obviously fentanyl isn’t quite as euphoric and much shorter lasting although some analogues of it actually are as long lasting as heroin)."

Neither had shit on the ""blue"" magic though as far as knockout strength. People were dropping on that shit. Luckily I avoided it knowing that it'd eventually dry up which it did. Folks were getting so sick and nothing around was doing shit for them."

Some people do say the pink or blue is more potent then the purple but it really comes down to the batch. Sometimes the purple can be more potent then the pink or blue.

598,Yeah you guys only have black tar h right? This stuff crushes up into a nice powder or dissolves clean for shooting.,"I'm jealous enough to consider relocating. In fact I'd do it in a heart beat for other reasons as well. The weather is one. Way too hot, and sunny.  If you love good h this is not the state of live in. It is pretty huge to be be fair so there's got to be exceptions to this.   If I could get mostly pure h of h/fent mix I would prob go back to sniffing it. It probably doesn't feel like you got stung by a bee and leave ugly bruises for days. Unless it does, wouldn't know. I swear to god if that stuff was around in my town it would cause quite the commotion. Our shit is provided from different sources who are as probably different as their product. I don't live in a big city (over 1mil) so it may just be under my radar. Why it's not here yet is beyond me. It's very misunderstood by a brainwashed public. Just never caught on quite enough by the right people in 60's, 70's, 80's etc, but it should be soon. Never seen a hungrier market, it's the product and people who have it that are off-putting to those who want and can afford. Very strange situation but as cultural barriers are bridged it new markets are opened. What we have is this weird stuff that is black, dry, brittle and powdery. It reeks of white vinegar. Loaded with particulates and matter. Once you get it to a boil the junk sticks to cooker. I have no intention of IVing the stuff, ever. Just too dirty and it's actually improved quite a bit over last year or two I tihnk. Unless we get better, cheaper dope this thing is going nowhere slow. Having an h habit should be better as far as product quality. Like my OC 80 habit was. People are always saying how a dime bag of ECP would get 10 people real loaded and I believe it. What we got is low grade opium with acetic acid, cooked and filtered(?). My best guess anyway. Would love to know a bit more about it cause this stuff just doesn't fit into the h hierarchy clearly at all. Purity 2-3%. The stuff is so hard that to crush it you have to press down on it with piece of plastic which makes holes in bag so you'll need a new one. it's crazy, people used ti IV it. Tried smoking it, not good. So went with liquid up nose for years. On latest relapse that wasn't cutting it and everyone else I found had moved on to IM so gave it a try and found it servicable. Gets job done in a very crude way. There's not enough logic to go around. To much meth possibly."

But the pink stuff is the strongest fenty i've come across","So from some people I’ve talked too, yeah I guess occasionally street dealers/junkie middle men are now cutting the fuck out of the strong purp, and making it weak depending on the area and your connection. But for me, the purple, blue or pink dope has 99% of the time been like at least 5x stronger then h would be, if not more. But yeah the purple fent for me has always been extremely strong like 90% of the time. 

I overdosed a few weeks back from the first bag ever of blue coloured dope (much under a single point)  I copped on the street, but thankfully I shot it at a safe injection site so they narcanned me and luckily I felt fine like 2 minutes later and didn’t even get bad withdrawals from the narcan. Just took one shot too, one 2mg narcan I believe right into my right shoulder, and I woke back up within 2 minutes.  It wasn’t scary I guess cause I was fucked up and I was at a safe injection site, but in hindsight it is kinda scary to think what if I did that alone? I shot the whole point at once though which I would never ever do alone, only because I was at the public safe injection site.  The lady said she was surprised how quickly I came back with only a single shot of narcan into my shoulder. Apparently my lips started going blue and I passed out and thats when they got out the narcan.

Whenever I do this coloured dope alone I always start with a tiny test shot, and if the safe injection site is open I’ll first dabble into it there.  

Still kinda trippy though because it was my first ever narcan necessary overdose in like 5 years of using. Only like twice before I woke up by myself with the needle beside me or in my arm, so I overdosed or nodded out hard but woke up by myself a few minutes later. That was a few years ago, this overdose from the blue fentanyl/heroin was just a few weeks ago and the first time I have ever been narcanned because I have always been so careful. 

Anyways, be safe guys! Make sure you do small test shots, try not to ever use alone, use safe injection sites if ur city has them, and if none of those are an option, at least shoot somewhere that u can walk into public right after in case u end up overdosing. Be safe guys!"

I attribute my weird tolerances and reactions to having one kidney. I think I process shit weirdly.","I'm just some random sham, but why all that acetaminophen when you only have one kidney left?  That would scare me to no end if I knew that I didn't have a back-up left."

Should I take a couple more?","Be careful thinking your body is used to the damage. Tylenol is really harsh on the liver and if you are doing this daily your body won’t get used to it, your liver is just taking accumulative damage and eventually you might fuck it up bad enough that it won’t be able to repair itself and you’ll be in horrendous pain and need a liver transplant or die.

Start cold water extracting them, it’s so easy and quick once you know what you are doing and gets rid of almost all the Tylenol, and if you do two washes to the left over material; you’ll make sure you don’t waste any of the hydrocodone:"

Unless your liver is previously damaged or you’ve been drinking alcohol or other liver processed drugs that day, you can honestly probably take like 4 grams of Tylenol at once in a 24 hour period and be just fine. It’s not recommend but yeah I’ve taken like 10-12 percocets at once multiple times and felt perfectly fine that day and the following days after. And that’s like 3.25-3.9g of acetaminophen at once. I know it’s not great for my liver overall and may even cause minor damage but as long as it’s a rare occasion, it’s never caused me problems. The liver is amazingly good at repairing itself, as long as you don’t cross a certain line where the damage becomes scar tissue and permanent.

As well as how dehydrating it is and how much it works your heart and other organs. When opiate use is kept in control and in safe dosage ranges, it’s pretty much harmless as far as damage to your body goes physically. It’s just the mental damage opiates cause that can ruin your life, rewiring your pleasure pathways and withdrawal etc. And of course overdose from respiratory depression if you aren’t careful and know your tolerance or get something heavily cut with fentanyl."

I did it for two years and went from perfect teeth to 9 cavities and my wisdom teeth had to be removed. I can’t imagine if I kept going how nasty my mouth could look. I was constantly dizzy to the point of blacking out too. Not worth it.

Heroin is my true love but I have too many people that care about me and if I use I’ll lose them.

I was *not* a responsible user either. I did as much as I could afford to without caring about safe dosages. The more the merrier too when it came to cut stuff. We were getting carfentynal cut dope and loved it!"

The high is just so damn warm and soothing and lovely, with seemingly no negatives at first. 

Be careful man, try to not get reckless with the opiates again. Always use at a safe injection site or with someone who has narcan or you can trust to call 911.  Also, Kratom has been a life safer for me. Not having to constantly worry about copping your next fix to stay well and not sick is fucking so great for staying on a good path and in control. For example I hadn’t done any heroin/fentanyl/dope for like 2 weeks until tonight, thanks to that beautiful Kratom as a cheap as fuck natural maintenance drug."

In my experience its good to take 3/4 of your regular dose about 1 hour before starting and then while drinking, talking etc. and you start to feel sick just take a minimum dose just to stay well. After drinking I would wait 4 hours untill speeping also just poping the minimum to sleep also it would be a good idea to have someone to take a closer look at you. That was in my experience always successfull. . I wish you the best of luck and stay safe mate."

If you want to be safe then you rather dont drink but if you dont want to stay off the alcohol then rather stick to beer and also the time span is good too. That should be a solid 3-5 hour break since your last Oxy dose, so thats better than nothing. If you stay alone at the hotel then you shouldnt redose the whole 120mg at night, IF you need to redoae then you should just take 60mg (half a pill) to stay off wds and also be more safer and not die because of breathing depression. If you got more questions then hit me up. I am very aware of the thema drinking and opioids, I used to drink alot while using H and pills.

So if a guy shows up, not dependent on heroin, admits that heroin isn't his DOC, admits that he doesn't even use other opioids, and says that habitually (and ONLY) uses illicit buprenorphine, the clinic is not allowed to take them on as a patient.",Not true. You can be in recovery and have zero opioids in your system but be at risk of a relapse and an understanding doctor will prescribe buprenorphine becasue hey harm reduction saves lives. Weird.
681,Not true. You can be in recovery and have zero opioids in your system but be at risk of a relapse and an understanding doctor will prescribe buprenorphine becasue hey harm reduction saves lives. Weird.,"Here's the thing, like I said in every single comment, including the one you replied to, he was openly speaking of using buprenorphine as his DOC. He wasn't clean, he wasn't only using illicut bupe to GET CLEAN.


He was using bupe from the street as his drug of choice, and the way he spoke to his doctor made it sound like his reason for purchasing and using the illicit bupe was his equivalent of purchasing and using other illicit opioids."
682,Doesn't playing dumb when you shouldn't be look suspicious as fuck with med pros?,"My GP just put me on subs when I said I was buying them off the street. He asked me how many I needed they even let me specify strips or pills and if I wanted the naloxone.

I went in to the clinic and told the doc he’d only find subs on a drug test, maybe kratom (weirdly something popped for methadone... I assume that was the kratom).

Also if you decide to get oxys then you should test them but keep in mind that they can test negative but still have fent in them because of all the fent analogues. Its your decision if your life is worth it risking an OD just for one high. But I think you guys over there in the US are already aware of that happening. You should consider buying them online from Europe but also there are for sure some fake blisters too. Though I didnt really fuck arround with pills much but I know that we still got the good ol OC 80s. Ours just dont have a marking on them since they are sold in blisters from different manufacturers. I just recently acquiered a script for 20x80mg Oxycodon ER from Sandoz and they were completly the same like the OC 80s I got 5 years ago. So that may be qn alternative for you.

Why did he peeled off his own face? Thats insane. Was he on meth, crack or normal cocaine? I cant imagine that someone on dope or fent peels off his skin of his face. Thats really crazy. When I was in rehab there was a kid who used to mix benzos, alc and alot of Amphetamin and meth. He was full of scars too. But he said the really stupid things like jumping out of a window from the second floor, he did when he was on meth, Amphetamine and a shit load of benzos. Thats some crazy shit and because of the benzos he couldnt remember why he was at a rehab facility after he jumped out off the window. He was a bit strange and didnt talk that much but  when his friends came over they told him about the window, he broke just his arm and was a bit injured at his head, I couldnt believe that this bit of injuroes came from jumping out of the window from the second floor. Sadly I heared that he relapsed and fell out of a car when he was all drugged up on stims and benzos and was drunk af, he broke his neck qnd died. Its always sad to hear that a 19 year old kid dies because he hated himself so much. His dad used to bring him benzos because he just wanted to stop using alc and stims. The clinic was ok with that, what I cant understand. I also said that I need to continue taking my opis but they denied and said that I would have to go if I want to continue them. I was clean for 4 month plus the month I stayed there. But at the end it was just a too boring way of life. But at least I stayed clean for the longest time in 5 years. Where did you get your oxys from? From the streets or from a doc? I am just curious cause if you got them from the streets then you probably are experienced with fent."

It's like they are made of plastic or something. Might as well just swallow them I guess. Or you can let them sit in cola or with something else acidic over night I've heard. Really makes them suck compared to original. With prices being what they are I think I've tried oxy like 2-3 times in last 15 years. I never even felt it on those occasions. Think I could prob find a percocet or two but those suck rather have a norco. It's so dumb they put vicodin/norco/percs in same category as morphine and shit.

That said maybe I should look for something stronger, maybe 1/4 90%+?

edit: That said it's gonna be going directly into my mouth and sitting there for 30 minutes. If any of the bacteria in the bottle can survive that they they deserve my body. Just googling it seems 50 to 60% alcohol is ideal for killing bacteria, so I'll think about that. Just not sure I'd want 50% alcohol under my tongue, so maybe I'll just put in half a tablet for 4 days then wash the bottle after that rather than going a week. either way it probably won't be too much of an issue so long as I keep the pipette from actually touching my mouth."

Just store in at room temperature away from light and as other has said be conscious of bacterial growth perhaps store in one of those sterile bacteriostatic vials or something.","Yes you're right. I've decided to buy some 10ml bottles, with a 1ml marked pipette. That way I can add 8ml of liquid by measuring it on the pipette. And if that seems too much I can just half it and add 4ml, then take 0.5ml under my tongue each day for 1mg of buprenorphine.

Thanks for the advice."
755,New doctor switched my pain meds. OxyContin and Oxycodone. Any tips on dosage timing?,Why does he have u on just quick acting pain meds that are meant for breakthrough pain ?
756,Why does he have u on just quick acting pain meds that are meant for breakthrough pain ?,"I don't know I just seen him for the first time he is a visiting practitioner home doctor. First thing he wanted to do was change all my medications.. I agreed to let go of the XR Oxy IF he would make sure I had enough IR to not end up withdrawing because the XR OxyContin messes with my heart and stomach anyway and I eventually want to be off them all completely and only use opiates if I really need them for severe breakthrough pain. 

I DO have 24/7 pain, but I'd rather find other things to take care of the 1-5 out of 10 scale pain and only use heavy meds for 6-10+ scale pain. I have spinal disc displacement and severe scoliosis from a car accident when I was only 5 years old so I've been disabled because of my back pain my whole life. So I've been on and off pain meds through my 20's but they are doing me more harm than good. I would like to have no withdralws and not be dependent and only get/take these when I really need them. So I eventually plan on doing MAT with Subutex to get off the IR eventually which is another thing that made me want to get off the XR because for treatment you have to wait 24-48+ hours when I'm an extended, but with Instant release the wait is only 12-24 hours before being able to use Subutex. 

So really the weird thing is my previous doctor is who pushed the XR on me any time I said I needed more IR he would say he's fine with giving me more XR but not IR and I even told him about detox eventually and said I really needed more IR to ween off the XR to eventually detox when the time comes. Yet he still wouldn't do anything or change my meds at all only say he'd switch me to morphine ect. And now this new doctor was upset that I was on the XR and wanted me off them and didn't seem to care about the IR at all. So I told him I would sacrifice my XR if I had at least the same mg amount to make up for the XR. He is going to give me 3 IR instead of 1&1/2 a day. But I have been trying to ween off the XR and am having WDs and am running out of my last script. I have some extra XR to ween off of after this week when I won't be prescribed them anymore, but I still don't know if the IR will take away all the WDs and make up for the XR completely... At least not for a while I'm sure my body has to adjust over time... 

Also the OxyContin was costing me like 200$ per script each month and the IR is only like 15$ so it will also be saving me a lot of money. I'm just nervous about all this since I've had the same doctor and been in the same meds and dosage for 3 years... He also switched up my anxiety and panic disorder meds. Trying to take me off 1mg Klonopin 3x a day and give me more Xanax 2mg up to 3x a day, which I DO need more Xanax because I run out easily if I'm having a bad month and can't control my panic attacks ect. But I've been on the Klonopin 2 years longer than the Xanax. And I know the Klonopin lasts 12 hours up to anyway and the Xanax only about 4-6 hours... So it's like my old doctor and my new doctor think the complete opposite about my medications. 

Sorry it took me a lot to reply to this comment. Lol just pretty on edge and running out of my meds already and still have 4 days until my new refills..."

762,Anyone not able to sleep after fent/tar?,"Definitely. Tar would always keep me up before I developed a tolerance. I'd mostly spend the night laying in bed scratching the fuck out of the opiate itches, not sure why I found it so appealing really now that I think about it."

I found it goes better if you just bring an empty 10 pack bag and say i need a box of these.

I could be wrong, and it shouldn't be any of their business but the people that actually use insulin probably aren't buying 10 packs of rigs. It just looks better to buy the whole box"
772,So.. where do you guys get your needles? Also best online stores?,"I live in Florida, the syringe law here states the pharmcist can sell it to you without a script but it's up to their discretion. The only pharmacy that sells me rigs is Walgreens. Try them out, they pulled out a log, made me show my ID and sign my name before he sold them to me. It's like $3 for a bag of 10 or like $15 for a box of 100. Alternatively you can just buy them on amazon and wait like 3-5 business days."
773,So.. where do you guys get your needles? Also best online stores?,the health department gives them out for free in my city

Never tried it. Never prescribed it. Likely never will. 

It’s a simple Alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Same as Clonidine. You can pay about $6 for a bottle of 100 Clonidine or $6000 or whatever they charge for medicine in America and do your part in propping up the pharmaceutical companies profits and the dividends of its shareholders. 

I know which one I’d go for (hint; it’s Clonidine)."

But that’s just the culture in America I guess. 

I’m sure it’s being marketed to physicians directly. 

I mean, why use an old, proven, safe, efficacious medication that is off patent and generic and nobody makes money off, when you can tweak things *ever so slightly* and make a new molecule that does exactly the same thing as the old one and now makes us billions of dollars and causes insurance premiums to skyrocket??

Don't like cannabis. I switched from suboxone to methadone about 1.5years ago. The methadone worked much better but the clinic didn't work at all. It took like a year to get my dose dialed in because what should take a week takes a month at these places. I was way better off when I had a bottle of methadone tablets and did it myself. Never had to go more than 20mg with the tabs. The crap they give out at clinics was a different story. They started me at 5mg, I slowly went up to 100mg in 5mg increments. Then had to slowly go back down 5mg at a time until I found 40mg most I could take without side effects. It didn't hold me 24 hours though. Methadone is one of the strongest analgesics I've tried with a low abuse potential. Be careful working out on the stuff. I gave myself rhabdo cause I could blow through the pain. The restrictions around methadone need to go, NOW.
BTW I'm done with clinic, relapsed, have a bunch of subutex but can't take it because of precipitated withdrawals. I really need methadone but can't get it because of clinics and outdated restrictions. It sucks. These places cause people much harm."

Keep that in mind, its super strong and got enough percentage to kill a long time user cause the street percentafe is on an qverage of 10-30% and the pharma grade is about 60-100% so go slow dude or you probably will die.

867,Can you take pure China white or pharmacy grade diamorphine intramuscularly without the risk of infection that #3 brown brings to the table?,"Pure? If you're sure it's pure? Then it depends on the state. Is it sealed? Is it already sterile?

I've had IM experience with ketamine and HCG. If you're just using as you prepare, sterile water is a must. If you're going to keep the water or mix, have to get bacteriostatic water. It's a bit different, cheap, otc or online.

The real answer, is it's still risky, it should be a no. If you tolerate the risk of ketamine, it's not going to be much different. Be safe.

Closest you can get is purchasing a bunch of micron filters, and using bacteriostatic water for your injections. You find both of these online easily, even on Amazon.

Also, regular insulin syringes will NOT give you an actual intramuscular injection. They're simply not long enough. Which is fie, since in order to use the micron filters, you have to buy special syringes like they use in the UK. The ones with detachable/replaceable needles.

I believe they're called ""Luer lock"" syringes."

I was hoping the virus would mask the WD's but its probably the opposite. At least I wont have to deal with the WD smell. My nose is all clogged up.

First time 95mg split doseing in Phoenix...

 Moved to North bay area stayed at a terrible clinic (SRTP) for 9 monthes or so at 135mg. Lost my wonderful grandmother due to murder in 2012... She was helping me pay the $400 a month. 

Took my first 21 day taper.

Lasted 4 monthes clean, relapsed....

9 month relapse, new clinic..

135mg once daily (before 10am) got my steps again. Bi weekly pick ups again. 

Overdosed on methadone and benzos. Bad...
21 day taper from 190mgs!

Clean for 4 years, now on Suboxone."

For me I didnt want the clinic because of one dose first thing in the am, when I was able to take it throughout the day, having to go every single day and it just fucking costs way too much to go the clinic route! I was only paying $28 a month for a script of 180/10mg pills. Clinic costs an average of 4 something per month! Pain managment docs are about the only route now and they too require way too many visits at a hefty price. It sucks all around!"

I'm pretty sure my insurance actually covers all, or most, of the costs for the clinic/MAT route, but it still sucks, especially since I have to then be doing meetings/counseling, taking piss texts, probably can't smoke pot anymore (I've heard clinics vary on this one). Ugh, just not sure what to do. I just get really scared at the idea of being locked down by a clinic and doctors discretion anytime I want to visit family for a few days, go on vacation, etc etc. If they gave a months worth of takehomes like subs it'd be a much easier decision (or if subs worked well for me, then that'd be an easier decision, but they don't)"
1037,How long does it take to lower your tolerance of opioids?,"Typical rule is 7 days tolerance is halved, 14 days tolerance is baseline. This all changes depending on how much you used and how long you’ve used.

It’s also worth noting that tolerance is “remembered” so it will be back to what it was very quickly. A few days at most and you’ll be back to using what you did before."
1038,How long does it take to lower your tolerance of opioids?,Typically 2 weeks but it comes back rapidly like the other guy said.
1039,Anyone ever experienced Tramadol withdrawals?,"I encounter this on a semi regular basis in clinical practice. It’s because a portion of tramadols analgesia is mediated through serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. When you come off tramadol after being physically dependent on it, you tend to experience a milder version of SSRI discontinuation syndrome and the associated symptoms. 

It’s also why when you do dose conversions between tramadol and other more classical opioids, the oMEDD can be somewhat misleading. You have to take care not to precipitate opioid withdrawal when rotating.

Edit: To actually answer your question, no I personally have not experienced tramadol withdrawals."

1052,will I need a higher dose of oxycodone after knee surgery? I’m not worried about during surgery/ general anesthesia but for post-op concerns mostly.,"I would hope that they would give at least percocet 10mg to take at least 4x daily, I'm basing this off what you've said about only needing 5mg oxycodone  twice? My god I wished I had a low tolerance like yourself! You are so so lucky, and I'm not talking about getting high I'm talking pain relief. But anyway your ortho can prescribe stronger pain meds to take along with what your doctor does. But yes I would say you most certainly need a higher dose, and I would hope that your surgeon will see it that way as well. Most do bit with the way things are these days, who knows..."

Last year, the same surgeon only prescribed 12 5mg oxycodone for 2 days after surgery but that was before I started this new regimen in March after the MRI revealed a torn meniscus in my other (right) knee. My PCP has no problem refilling my 28 day a script for 56 of the 5 mg variety so I’m hoping in consultation with the orthopedic surgeon, I could either get an increase with those or maybe if I’m lucky, a few Dilaudid/OC, but I doubt that. Also note: I can’t take Percocet because I have pretty bad IBSD so the regular Oxy without APAP doesn’t bother my stomach at all. I would imagine I need at least an increase in the dosage for at least the first 2 to 3 days afterward because I’m no longer opiate naive. This is really is a huge concern for me because I never get high but have a high sensitivity to pain."
1054,Does DXM potentiate codeine?? Keep coming up with conflicting informarion please help!,"DXM does effectively potentiate opioids and you don't even have to use massive amounts like you would for a trip as I've used 120 milligrams to potentiate Heroin before.

If you're using DXM for that take it an hour before your opioid of choice. Codeine and it's derivatives like Hydrocodone and Oxycodone might be bad opioids to use with DXM because both DXM and Codeine need to be metabolized into their active metabolites (DXO in the case of the DXM and Morphine in the case of Codeine) and they're both metabolized into those things by the CYP2D6 enzyme and they'd compete for the enzyme."

1097,Have you ever found any studies involving men or a mix of both sexes?,From what I heard from nurses it’s just a common correlation. So yes maybe not totally causative but it happens enough that it’s almost a tell of a heavy user. It’s like one  way medical professionals can identify a heavy user is they complain about hearing problems at a relatively young age.

1109,You'll probably feel the same as before you snorted it. That's a very low dose and snorting means you're not absorbing as much as you would had you swallowed it,"This. Once advised someone to only snort half a 15mg at once and then wait a good long while before trying the next half. They ended up not getting much out of it at all.

It's been a couple hours so OP if you're reading this I would just take the other half orally with its higher bio-availability being that way any way (I don't want to start an argument on ROA but yeah...) and next time you come across one, if you really didn't feel anything from half- which is not super surprising- rail 3/4 to the whole thing at once.

This is all assuming it is pharma."

1116,Ok I might wait a few more minutes Just to be safe. I’m new to opioids so I’m not sure what it would take to overdose for someone with little tolerance,"Snorting one whole 15 mg pill definitely won’t make you overdose if you haven’t mixed with any other drugs, especially downers like benzos or alcohol. Now many people react badly to opioids, mainly in the form of nausea and stomach issues, so if it’s too much for your body it may be uncomfortable, but the worst that will happen is you’ll puke and get a headache for a bit. You’ll definitely be okay though. Always a good idea to start with 1/4 or 1/2 of any new drug though, so glad you did that. Also, snorting oxy has a lower bioavailability than taking it orally, however snorting gives a faster onset and a bit of a “rush”. So by snorting them they will hit faster and stronger, but won’t last as strong or peak as hard as eating the pills"

By no means do I dislike LGBT people for their sexuality but I find their activism to be annoying and too in your face sometimes.

What particular instance?

Uh, the OP said nothing about snorting. The OP was talking about mass hysteria if people were od'ing off fentanyl residue in Bill's. That kind of hysteria would only happen if it were transmitted by touch to anyone handling the bills.

That makes my first source relevant.

Anything is theoretically possible. Unfortunately, the idea that it is possible can lead to people's unnecessary deaths.

Many doctors are cash only, from my what friends that I know who are on subs deal with.

I don’t think a doctor can call the police due to the privacy laws, but I can’t say with 100% certainty. I highly doubt it though. Suboxone has saved my life. But it’s a pain to get off of. Keep your daily dose as low as you can. Less is more with this drug, IMO."

People die every day from that combo because they both suppress breathing and heart rate, so you can kind of think of doing both of them as doubling down on the opiates and risking an overdose. Be very careful with this combo, it's what actually causes a lot of the deaths that get attributed to opiates."

That really encapsulates my issue with AA/NA. Everyone gets way too involved with each other's recovery in an egotistical sort of way.

The whole program feels a little dated and even misrepresented with regard to MAT especially. There's a quote from Bill W. on methadone. I can't remember it exactly, but it basically amounts to him saying that all avenues should be available for people who want to pursue recovery. He was talking to one of the people who pioneered MMT.

If you are fairly social and accept instructions well odds are you will flourish with a 12 step program.  I don't go at all because I'm on suboxone and that is heavily stigmatized in the rooms of recovery.   I also work full time at a fairly physically demanding job, and the last thing I want to do after a busy day is go to a meeting that starts at 8:00 pm and force myself to have to talk to people.  12 step people from my experience are very black and white about what being clean is.  Take a sip of beer or puff a j and bam your sobriety is fucked.  Start the clock back at zero.  In my opinion if you're not shooting dope or doing what ever it is that fucks you off and living a productive life and not being a shitty person then why the fuck do you need a 12 step program.   I understand that they help millions of people, but I think since that most rehabs are 12 step based a lot of addicts get the idea that AA and NA are the only viable routes to recovery, which is not the case."

Everyone seems to get the impression that NA is trying to indoctrinate you into being ""one of us"" or something. You guys make it sound like a cult and that couldn't be farther from the truth. At least in my experience with NA. I'm from a *large* city and have been to meetings all over it. Hundreds of meetings. Never once did I feel like someone was trying to shove something down my throat. It's antithetical to what they're about. If it were too religious, or zealous it would turn people off.

Some members preach hard on an individual level and can be a turn off. Some tend to grab onto NA with both hands and never let go and that's a good thing, but they can sometimes be over-zealous. I don't care as long as they're doing what they need to do to stay clean.

I never finished the steps but I stayed clean with the help of NA, a lot of good people and **my will** to stay clean. I was clean for 15 years with NA as the backbone or impetus, if you will, for it.

I think folks that go there thinking that the people in NA are there to pull them in and sucker them into believing some horseshit, aren't going to give it a chance. I think if you *really* want to be clean, you'll try as hard at **that** as you did at staying high. I could *never* complain about how far away a meeting was because I've driven twice as far for drugs an uncountable number of times.

-Certain % are lonely or emotionally needy people that need others for validation and/or recognition. Most are newly aloof socially IRL.

-Many living in FEAR even years into sobriety. Sure, a little bit is healthy, but fuck that. (Ex. Those that do not keep ANY numbers in their phone besides sponsor, believing connections will ONLY lead to relapse.)

-Life consuming obsession w recovery to a point that it hinders anything beyond it. **The only thing worse than unbridled addiction IMO, is tortured thoughts 24/7 of using, without actually using.**

1286,I only tried it once and it felt so bad. Never again. I think people who enjoy it must be fucking morons,The only reason I did it was because I was still addicted to the needle. Iv'd dope and coke for years with few issues. Killed my veins in months with this Shit.
1287,"OK, so exactly how do you IV a strip of Suboxone?","Do 2mg or under or it will saturate your receptors. Just fold the strip into 8 squares. Tear off one or two squares (1-2mg) and put 30 units on it. Let it sit still in the spoon for 2-3 minutes. Take your plunger out and dab it over and over until you can stir it into a solution. Put a tight cotton in or on the tip of your needle and pull.

What he takes for a regular dose might be enough to kill someone else, but may be normal for him, so that's not the best way to judge. Though, if he's constantly nodding that's a good sign he's on a high dose and the other commenter who suggested having narcan around just in case is spot on. IV drug use is inherently harmful, especially if he's reusing or sharing needles, and if he's IVing *pills* then that comes with many potential health problems as well. If he's concerned about his addiction and his health he needs to seek professional help.

Edit: clarification"

He has always said he has the will power to quit, and claims that he has quit multiple times. He also claims that the “rejection” from his family drives him back to it. I believe he suffers from chronic depression. He also has a 1.5 year old daughter now, so maybe that is what truly has sparked his concerns about his addiction."
1323,How dangerous is Opana (oxymorphone)?,I thought opana was dead
1324,How dangerous is Opana (oxymorphone)?,"If he's shooting pills the biggest effect on his health is the filler junk that ends up in his veins and the complications of collapsed veins, etc. from constant IV. There are typically actually very few real health effects from using opiates outside of the fact that many people who use them do not practice good bodily hygiene/care. If he's more concerned about his health than actually stopping he should have his blood pressure checked. That is the main health risk, any cardiovascular complications caused by IVing impure product and just jamming a needle into his veins so many times. 

Of course doing opiates in the current market is always dangerous, especially with all the fentanyl. Shooting pharmacy pills is actually a comparatively safe option compared to street product, so I suppose he's better off than most in that way."
1325,How dangerous is Opana (oxymorphone)?,"I'm literally on like day 9 or 10 of detoxing from OP.

3. Drink a shiiiiiit ton of water and take a SHIIIIT TON of hot ass showers and just sit in that steamy bitch 
4.

Aiight bring your marshmallows and gather around the campfire and allow me to regale you with a tale of neurobiology..

Exogenous opioid agonists (smack, oxycotton, dillies) bind to opioid receptors (which are distributed throughout the CNS and concentrated in certain specific areas and also in the gut). These agonists when consumed bind to opioid receptors (there are several kinds such as the Mu, Kappa, Delta) and they all have their own endogenous (made in the body) ligands (substances your body produces specifically to bind to and activate these receptors). 

The “fun time” opioids we all know and love, through happenstance and serendipity, happen to bond to the same receptors (usually the Mu receptor) that the (endorphins, enkephalins etc) bind to. 

When you swallow or bang etc opioids, they are distributed throughout the body and a few molecules find their way to your brain. Once there they bind to these receptors. The system that we are concerned with is the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway.

For our purposes, they bind to receptors in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and cause a release of dopamine into another part of the pathway called the nucleus accumbens (NAC). This causes subjective feelings of pleasure and wellbeing. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is responsible for attenuating the feelings of pleasure and basically cockblocking you so you don’t become addicted to drugs. It’s the part that is responsible for you making well thought out, reasoned and rational decisions and exerting executive control. 

Obviously the PFC doesn’t always work the way it’s supposed to. Hence, well, drug addiction...

Anyway, once you become addicted to the pleasurable feelings that opioids induce, a few nifty neurochemical adaptations take place. They are as follows: 

The more you take opioids, your body downregulates your opioid receptors. It becomes so used to you taking opioids, that you need to take more and more to overcome the insensitivity and cause the VTA to release the same amount of dopamine into the NAC and give you that sweet, sweet euphoria you’re used to. 

NOW, if you’re wondering “that explains the high, but I asked about ANXIOLYSIS!” well we’re getting there I promise. 

So when you take opioids they ALSO bind to Mu receptors in the Locus Ceruleus (LC). The LC runs on noradrenaline (NA) The LC basically spritzes NA into other parts of the brain. Now NA does many things, but among them is keep you awake. Hence why drugs that increase NA, keep you awake as a side effect. Now this is where things get interesting and explain how withdrawal works. 

When you take opioids it suppresses the release of NA from the LC. As a result, you nod off, your blood pressure and breathing decrease (NA modulates these). So that’s part of why you nod off. It’s also why you feel calm (part of it). 

Normally the endogenous opioids (endorphins that your body makes) bind to receptors and cause a process to occur by which a chemical called adenosine triphosphate (ATP)  is turned into another chemical called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which causes the release of NA. This finely tuned mechanism ensures you’re alert, breathing and doing your thing. 

When you take opioids, (despite them sharing similarities with endogenous ligands) they *inhibit* the enzyme that converts ATP to cAMP which therefore causes a reduced amount of NA. So you feel sleepy and have lower muscles tone, heart rate and breathing. 

Now with continued use, your body begins to ramp up ATP production to compensate. Thereby restoring cAMP and NA levels to an artificially high level. By now, you’re not nodding as hard and your tolerance is high. 

Now, when you all of a sudden take opioids away, guess what? The ATP & cAMP are absolutely pumping NA into your system in UNGODLY amounts. Without opioids to attenuate this, we get....withdrawal symptoms! 

The excess of NA is what causes most of the extremely unpleasant symptoms of withdrawal (along with Glutamate but we won’t go there, this is long enough as it is). If you wonder why Doctors (and 9/10 junkies) recommend Clonidine for withdrawal, it is because Clonidine is an Alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist that acts presynaptically. What the fuck does that mean? It means that it ramps “UP” NA production. 

Wait, if NA is what is making me feel withdrawal, why the fuck do I want to INCREASE it?!?! Well, you don’t postsynaptically. That would be bad. But lucky for you that Clonidine activates the negative feedback loop *before* it can dump more into your brain and tells the LC to chill out and not release anymore NA. It basically tells the LC that theres enough already and to not make more. Thereby attenuating a lot of the NA mediated symptoms of withdrawal. Obviously your body returns to normalcy after a week or so as things settle down and get back to normal. Hence why withdrawal only lasts a week or so. 

As an aside, you’ll definitely experience diminishing returns if you dose daily or regularly. If you think anxiety and depression are bad now, wait till you have a crippling opioid addiction on top of that.

Aiight bring your marshmallows and gather around the campfire and allow me to regale you with a tale of neurobiology..

Exogenous opioid agonists (smack, oxycotton, dillies) bind to opioid receptors (which are distributed throughout the CNS and concentrated in certain specific areas and also in the gut). These agonists when consumed bind to opioid receptors (there are several kinds such as the Mu, Kappa, Delta) and they all have their own endogenous (made in the body) ligands (substances your body produces specifically to bind to and activate these receptors). 

The “fun time” opioids we all know and love, through happenstance and serendipity, happen to bond to the same receptors (usually the Mu receptor) that the (endorphins, enkephalins etc) bind to. 

When you swallow or bang etc opioids, they are distributed throughout the body and a few molecules find their way to your brain. Once there they bind to these receptors. The system that we are concerned with is the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway.

For our purposes, they bind to receptors in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and cause a release of dopamine into another part of the pathway called the nucleus accumbens (NAC). This causes subjective feelings of pleasure and wellbeing. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is responsible for attenuating the feelings of pleasure and basically cockblocking you so you don’t become addicted to drugs. It’s the part that is responsible for you making well thought out, reasoned and rational decisions and exerting executive control. 

Obviously the PFC doesn’t always work the way it’s supposed to. Hence, well, drug addiction...

Anyway, once you become addicted to the pleasurable feelings that opioids induce, a few nifty neurochemical adaptations take place. They are as follows: 

The more you take opioids, your body downregulates your opioid receptors. It becomes so used to you taking opioids, that you need to take more and more to overcome the insensitivity and cause the VTA to release the same amount of dopamine into the NAC and give you that sweet, sweet euphoria you’re used to. 

NOW, if you’re wondering “that explains the high, but I asked about ANXIOLYSIS!” well we’re getting there I promise. 

So when you take opioids they ALSO bind to Mu receptors in the Locus Ceruleus (LC). The LC runs on noradrenaline (NA) The LC basically spritzes NA into other parts of the brain. Now NA does many things, but among them is keep you awake. Hence why drugs that increase NA, keep you awake as a side effect. Now this is where things get interesting and explain how withdrawal works. 

When you take opioids it suppresses the release of NA from the LC. As a result, you nod off, your blood pressure and breathing decrease (NA modulates these). So that’s part of why you nod off. It’s also why you feel calm (part of it). 

Normally the endogenous opioids (endorphins that your body makes) bind to receptors and cause a process to occur by which a chemical called adenosine triphosphate (ATP)  is turned into another chemical called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which causes the release of NA. This finely tuned mechanism ensures you’re alert, breathing and doing your thing. 

When you take opioids, (despite them sharing similarities with endogenous ligands) they *inhibit* the enzyme that converts ATP to cAMP which therefore causes a reduced amount of NA. So you feel sleepy and have lower muscles tone, heart rate and breathing. 

Now with continued use, your body begins to ramp up ATP production to compensate. Thereby restoring cAMP and NA levels to an artificially high level. By now, you’re not nodding as hard and your tolerance is high. 

Now, when you all of a sudden take opioids away, guess what? The ATP & cAMP are absolutely pumping NA into your system in UNGODLY amounts. Without opioids to attenuate this, we get....withdrawal symptoms! 

The excess of NA is what causes most of the extremely unpleasant symptoms of withdrawal (along with Glutamate but we won’t go there, this is long enough as it is). If you wonder why Doctors (and 9/10 junkies) recommend Clonidine for withdrawal, it is because Clonidine is an Alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist that acts presynaptically. What the fuck does that mean? It means that it ramps “UP” NA production. 

Wait, if NA is what is making me feel withdrawal, why the fuck do I want to INCREASE it?!?! Well, you don’t postsynaptically. That would be bad. But lucky for you that Clonidine activates the negative feedback loop *before* it can dump more into your brain and tells the LC to chill out and not release anymore NA. It basically tells the LC that theres enough already and to not make more. Thereby attenuating a lot of the NA mediated symptoms of withdrawal. Obviously your body returns to normalcy after a week or so as things settle down and get back to normal. Hence why withdrawal only lasts a week or so.

Idk 🤷🏻‍♂️","Buprenorphine works for depression because it acts as an antagonist of the Kappa receptor. While all opioid receptors when activated cause analgesia and respiratory depression, when you agonise the Kappa, it also causes dysphoria (really bad feels, man). 

That’s why Kappa agonists don’t have much utility as analgesics. Because what’s the point of killing someone’s pain, if you give them a panic attack and freak out. There are plenty of other drugs that kill pain without doing that. But buprenorphine doesn’t agonise the Kappa receptor, it *antagonises* (blocks) it. 

So if activating the Kappa receptor causes dysphoria (freak outs, panic and feelings of doom) then why happens if you do the opposite? Well in this case, antagonising the Kappa doesn’t cause euphoria, but it DOES cause an absence of dysphoria. Which is precisely what you want in an antidepressant. 

Contrary to popular belief, you don’t want to get depressed patients high, you want to get them not depressed. 

The issue with buprenorphine is that it ALSO agonises the Mu receptor and can cause euphoria and addiction. Now we don’t want to give depressed patients an opioid addiction, but we DO want the Kappa antagonist/anti depressive properties. The buprenorphine molecule does one thing we want, one thing we don’t. So what to do? 

Simple! 

You add on a biased Mu receptor *antagonist* that will block the “high” of buprenorphine on the Mu receptor (so no euphoria or addiction) and because the antagonist is biased and ONLY works on the Mu receptor, you can leave the bupe to do its thing on the Kappa receptor, while not giving your patient a high! 

So yeah, bupe in that context is sustainable. But with Mu agonists (oxy, dillies, smack etc) forget about it. Not in a million years is it sustainable (or desirable) as we said, we want “non depressed” patients, not “high as a kite” patients. 

Just my $0.02 anyway.

I always look forward to reading your posts.

Reading this makes me think of when we use dexmedetomidine in ICU. Do you know, does clonidine cause increased GABA activity like dexmedetomidine does? Is clonidine just a weaker agonist compared to dex and that's why you dont get the level of sedation like you do with IV dex? Or, is it just a  simple case of dosage with clonidine being dosed obviously in a smaller proportion in order to not have someone be a barely rousable intubated sack of tissue like they are with a dex infusion?

I wish we could use dex more but pharmacy is soooooooo stringent with it because it is abhorrently expensive compared to whatever the docs sedation flavor of the day is; midaz, hydro, ketamine, fent or even propofol which is expensive as is."

The only thing I felt you could have mentioned was that everything the body does in response to chronic opioid use (increased noradrenaline, receptor down-regulation, etc) is an effort to keep us alive. Being high on opioids is about as far from homeostasis as one can get, and respiratory depression and low blood pressure are potentially deadly consequences. 

Pretty ironic to think that the mechanisms that make us feel so shitty during withdrawal may have actually saved our life during active use."

I was on a low dose for a few years, then when they stopped working...I found a hack...it's called not eating, so that the same dose would provide the same relief from crippling anxiety....and that worked until I hit 119 lbs.   

Kicking was the hardest decision I've ever made and also the best.  If you rely on a pill to give you that dopamine hit, you'll forever be chasing the dragon.   Your body needs to recalibrate so that it can start producing dopamine naturally.  And it's gonna take time.

I stepped off, cold turkey from 60mg/day  on New Years day 2019, and the only thing that got me through was watching opiate withdrawal videos on YT.   I'd see these brave souls on YT showing the world how they were doing day by day, week-by-week, month-by-month.   If I was on day 3...I'd watch a dude on day 8 say he was feeling a bit better.  

As far as managing anxiety...it takes a lot of work.  All that stuff I thought was bullshit like exercise/diet/sleeping/deep breathing...actually works, but you have to get back to baseline and commit to it.   Best of luck...we're pulling for you."

For me mine comes from my intense fear of death and from things ive done in my past and people who have died and the permanence and lack of control I have of all that.  It clings to my brain as a thought I cant move on from for long periods of time. Once I started to experience withdrawal and I became aware that I was genuinely addicted, that just added to my list of anxiety triggers. Basically using opiates to quiet the tension in your head momentarily is a fools errand because the few fleeting moments of quietness come with a whole heap of sad family and friends/health risks/constant intense cravings and other extreme anxiety inducing things. Everybody is at risk to quickly become addicted no matter how  responsibly you begin your opiate journey."

but please know that you’re going down a very dark road. regular, daily use of these drugs is setting you up to eventually feel an anxiety and depression orders of magnitude greater than what you would have in their absence.

if there’s any way at all you can use these drugs *occasionally*, without daily regularity, and with *extreme* caution, they may remain available to you as buoys or intermittent lifesavers in a very turbulent ocean. if you keep using them all the time, it’s like sailing out into that ocean on disintegrating boat."

1416,You mean methqdone for mental health? Like asking my psych doc to prescribe methadone for my anxiety? Or am I not understanding,"No, you'd have to get it at a methadone clinic or a methadone doctor for substance abuse if you're in a European country or Canada. It's very unlikely to get any opioid for mental health, almost impossible in the US. However as long as you have some opioid in your system it's usually pretty easy to get on methadone, even in the US as long as there's a clinic close by, some want you to be in withdrawal though. Now going every day is a hassle but if opioids really are the only answer and you're really that bad off without it's a good solution. Again it's how I get through my day. A doctor, even a psychiatrist has the authority to prescribe methadone for mental health and therefore it's not completely impossible but since there is literally not one study on using methadone like this you're more likely to get oxycodone or oxymorphone which both have one case report or so. The reason I get methadone is because I was prescribed oxy for anxiety in Germany and was on such a high dose that i then counted as dependent and was able to go on methadone. Now I'm on so much that going off would take a few months at least."

Now, people have been maintained on small doses like that for years, even decades, many claiming they still get some benefit. But the main number one reason you shouldn't do it is because if you're dosing for mental health issues, you will invariably dose yourself more and more to chase that 'normal' feeling. In fact, it's not normal, it's better than normal but it is very hard to not view yourself as a victim and say this is how I should feel all the time. I was actually prescribed oxy and morphine for anxiety and depression. Go way back in my post history and youll see me posting about it and many people telling me it's a bad idea. A lot of those people said it in a very unpleasant manner but many also kindly informed me it wouldn't work out well and I should have listened.

Plenty of people get prescribed opioids and don't use/need all of them.

Luckily I keep the doses low so I never have bad withdrawals when I come off them completely like the past few days, but it really goes to show how quickly a habit can develop.","I could get Tram and I liked them before only thing that worries me about tram is I currently am weaning off benzos after ten years of use which means I’m a seizure risk, tramadol notoriously lowers threshold= potentially bad combination.......I am however on gabapentin which is an anticonvulsant so perhaps cancels out??"

Low doses are much less likely to cause seizures so it all depends on your metabolism. Mine is stupid high and 25 mg is enough for me, 150 mg makes me worry about it. 

It's all about availability with tram since it doesn't work for so many people, they're eager to get rid of it."
1421,"For my entire life anxiety has crippled my entire existence. I am a shell of my former self who I was as a kid running around happy.

They did go a bit brown on the leaves and red in the stems and look quite unwell for a while but they picked up and started flowering a few months ago. Still getting flowers :)

btw not all opium poppies produce much opium, the idea that anything labelled Somniferum will have a high opium content isn't the case I think, you'll want to confirm the seeds are potent if you're growing them for that purpose."

But you’ll need a ton of space to even get a weeks supply if you have any kind of habit. I had about a 2m square area to work with and I got a few doses of smokeable late . Certainly could have been more efficient, but don’t think this is your ticket to free dope year round. And unless you’re in the Southern Hemisphere you’re asking at exactly the wrong time.





I don’t really understand why you having come into some money has anything to do with this. It legit just takes some poppy seeds from your grocery store and some land. It’s not grown like weed with a big investment in equipment and lighting. I guess you could be more efficient if you found a source for seeds bred for opium content, but any store bought brand from the spice aisle will do, even if they have less of the good stuff."

1447,How do I shoot g73?,"What you need:

* 91% isopropyl alcohol, must be 91% or higher

* 2 cookers, I use the bottom of pop cans

Steps:

* Remove coating with damp paper towel, don't use spit.

* Crush the pill to a fine powder.

* Put desired amount of shot in first cooker, add 3mL (full syringe is usually 1mL, which is the same as 1CC) or so of 91% iso, mix this shit up and let it sit for a couple mins

* Use a cotton and suck up all of the iso/drug liquid. An oral syringe works the best for this step.

* Squirt the iso/drug liquid into second cooker, the more surface area the faster it evaps. Some people burn it off, I do not and don't recommend it.

* Once it is totally evaporated add desired amount of water to cooker that has the dried thin layer of now pure oxymorphone and filter it through cotton once again to be safe.

* Inject

This is probably not the safest thing in the world to do, but it is better than a lot of other shit that people do when shooting pills. Remember that 91% iso is very flammable."

1494,What do you guys think? Using while inducting on subs.,"Ideally you should just use the buprenorphine. I have no idea how taking other opiates will effect the induction process, but if I had to guess I would say it shouldn't have too much of an effect and the buprenorphine will still build up and your body still adjust to it. But when you stop using the other opiates you will still likely be faced with feeling worse, so it's probably better to try to ride it out and only take what you really need for sleep etc. It really can suck I know but after a while it will level out and you'll feel alright.

Not a doctor so I cant say one way or another what effect using on top will have overall, but in my experience you can take opiates on top of buprenorphine to help with the less-pleasant effects the buprenorphine can have when you're not on a stable dose and adjusting to it. But whether that will just prolong the induction process or somehow interfere with it, I don't know, I've only done it a few times and even then I'm only one person.

Also without wanting to sound preachy using on top isn't going to help with breaking the mental addiction. In my experience part of the benefit of using buprenorphine is dosing once a day and not looking for those hits.

Hope you start feeling a little better soon. Good luck."

Buprenorphine is a funny drug, it can be a pain to get on, it's a strange sensation like mini-withdrawals, I'm guessing because it has such a high binding affinity it replaces your endorphins in the same way it would any other opiate, leading to the leg and back acheyness and general withdrawal-like symptoms. The lack of sleep is the worst for me. I can deal with it knowing I can sleep and have my morning subs soon, but when it's 11pm and you know you're not sleeping and you feel like crap it's awful knowing you still have to wait 6 or 7 hours until you can get any relief.

Still, it's just a matter of sticking it out and adjusting. Easier said than done I know, but it's worth it in my opinion.

Like I said I've used on top in the past and it definitely helps, I'm just not sure if like you said when you stop using on top you'll have mini withdrawals from that. I'd expect to feel a bit rougher but I doubt it'll be too bad. If you have anything that might help you sleep I'd recommend using that and trying to sleep before using on top, that's what I tend to do if I'm feeling tempted, though it doesn't always work. I have some quetiapine that I use rarely for this, but a drowsy anti-histamine or something similar could help. Obviously be careful not to take something too strong, buprenorphine is nowhere near as bad as other opiates for respiratory depression but it's still worth considering.

Hope things improve soon, you got this!"

And now I’ve been off that for about a week. It’s a bitch trying to get off but I’ve been opiate free for a week! Longest I’ve been clean in 3 years.

Edited to add: Before my car wreck I was not on drugs. I don’t even smoke weed. I had major surgery in 2011 and didn’t even fill the opiate prescription then. I was in a ton of pain and figured the pain meds would help this time. They did. But now I wish I never touched them. I wish my dr would of paid attention and never refilled my prescription."

BUT at the time suburban doctors would write you prescriptions for opiate based cough syrup for the most minor coughs. they were being told to prescribe this stuff by pharma reps of course. i remember my doctor had Tussionex pens (a brand of opiate cough syrup). there were so many cheap cheap generic hydrocodone based syrups that it's hard to remember them all. what people started doing was seeing campus doctors or personal doctors and then selling the syrup at high prices. my doctor at the time would write me entire pints for histinex? which was a generic for tussionex. of course it was very easy to get the purple stuff all the rappers talk about too. but that was usually a bummer to get because it was only codeine. i found myself feeling sick after drinking syrup/popping pills etc every single day for months on end. so yea basically just doctors and people trying to capitalize off of their own scripts. i was around and using for what would become the perfect storm that we now know as the opioid epidemic. things have changed dramatically and kids are willing to get high off strange powders and liquids from china etc. but it's all the same. people feel like they don't have a place in this world. they feel depressed they feel lonely they feel like they can't truly connect with others. they will turn to things to immediately relieve the misery they feel. maybe if we lived in a world that didn't vilify drug addicts and celebrate doctors. we would have a chance at tackling this problem at it's source. but yea big pharma got us addicted to their products. most of us would have never tried them if they weren't so incredibly easy to get.

Back then pills were abundant and less guarded. Everybody had a family member prescribed them and some of us were dumb and never moved on from chasing a high.
1512,What started you on opiates?,Stole 6 pink 10 mgs from my grandpa. Continued to steal them every time he had them. Only saw him every 2 weeks or so. But eventually Got a job and personal dealer's. Been struggling ever since
1513,What started you on opiates?,"I was researching drugs and opioids sounded like a fun high. So I was dumb enough to ignore the slew of warnings and did them without knowing weather I was gonna get addicted or not. Fortunately I’m not. I make damn sure I do everything I can to not become addicted to anything at all not just opioids. It’s November now and I started back in March. Still not addicted thank the gods. The first one I did was codeine. I got a Tylenol 3 and snorted. I knew codeine was the weakling of the opioids so I wasn’t expecting to get high. To my surprise, I actually got a pretty good high off of it. That was back when the only drugs I’ve done were weed, shit quality cocaine, and K2. I’ve done a lot more since then. But the opioids I’ve done since the codeine are, tramadol, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and methadone. Methadone was the absolute best one. I took 10mg orally. That’s a common dose according to the psychonaut wiki so I was feeling it real good. Still got some oxy left so I might do that soon."

Awhile later I stole them and sold a few for like $10/15 a piece (before the prices ballooned). I wondered what the hell the hype was about, took one. About 30 minutes later I completely understood the pull of it... and here we are now."

The other one was a detox in the same wing as their rehab so you could go to the groups that they were holding otherwise you’d just stay in your room, you couldn’t be in the lounge area while groups were going on"
1521,Detox?,depends on where you go. wherever you decide to go. don't believe everything they tell you and do your own thorough research. typically they'll give you a suboxone or methadone taper with klonopin or valium. the one i went to last time did that for about a week. i got off of things pretty comfortably. i still experienced insomnia afer i was done with the taper. but it was mainly just really really boring. if you're smart you'll bring books and if you're lucky you'll have your own tv/room. everywhere is different. now detox that i've done in an actual medical setting like within a hospital wing. that has been very very comfortable. same medication used just better more personalized care and tons of personal space with your own tv that actually has decent channels. i liked it a lot.

You may feel a little. But it's nowhere near what it would be like without the bupe. So if you want to go for it but you won't be nodding or anything like that. Unless, like kicker mentioned, you do crazy high doses. I definitely don't recommend stopping your subutex to get high man."
1554,Does buprenorphine alone block opiates?,Yes
1555,Does buprenorphine alone block opiates?,"Stop believing the junky myths that some asshole tells you even though hes never even tried to take a subutex.

The naloxone does nothing unless you inject it within ~24 hours of getting high. And even then it just makes you have really strong pwds for 45 mins until it wears off and then the bupe pwds last for the next 8-24 hours.

Bupe is a partial agonist with antagonist properties which means it acts like narcan when you have dope in your system.

And also, dont believe the myth avout cotton fever from a pieve of cotton in the shot.  Cotton fever is caused by bacteria growing on a moist cotton then you inject the bacteria straight into your bloodstream."

1560,Why does oxy make me happy?,"The short answer is that the oxy binds to opiate receptors in your brain, and signals for the release of dopamine into your system. Dopamine is the natural chemical in our bodies that makes us feel good. There are healthy things we do that cause dopamine release- exercise, sex, music, and eating for instance. Unfortunately, nothing floods our system with a massive amount of dopamine quite like opioids, so no, there are no other non-addictive ways to replicate that feeling.

That dopamine rush is opioids’ greatest gift and also its biggest curse. Stay safe, friend."

The high is too good and too tempting, and any more frequent use will eventually lead to a daily habit and physical/psychological dependence. Good luck, friend."

That's the secret; take them only every so often and you'll keep your tolerance low, the effect extra pleasant and the risk of dependence lower. Keep it a special treat and not the standard.

1612,Way to fill a prescription without my doctor knowing?,"If you do this, there is a 100% chance you will be caught. Every state has an electronic prescription database and shares that info with other states (so you’d likely be caught even if going out of state). All health care providers (including your doctor) and pharmacies have access to this database, so they will know if you’re attempting to fill multiple/duplicate scripts. 

I know there is a temptation to try and cash in on the mistake, but this would be a terrible idea. You WILL get caught. At the very least you will be labeled a drug seeker and your doctor and pharmacist will cut off your scripts. At worst you could be charged with prescription fraud (a felony).

Fraud was easy to get away with 15 years ago before electronic databases, but it’s not an option anymore. Just throw the extra script in the trash... I know it hurts and you feel like you’re wasting an opportunity, but the alternative is going to be much, much, worse if you attempt to fill that extra script."

1644,How to remove atropine from diphenoxylate?,"I'm thinking you're talking about lomotil (unfortunately motofen, its stronger cousin is still almost impossible to find despite it being returned to the market after a ~decade long hiatus)

For some reason I've never been susceptible to the anti-muscarinic effects of atropine and can swallow 20 of the tiny bastards at a time when I've been forced to by withdrawals (or ultra-diarrhea) because of some snafu with my pain doctor like being unable to make an appointment.

Anyway! IIRC the two compounds have vastly different half-lives and durations of action, so staggering your doses can allow the atropine to be eliminated while the diphenoxylate continues to work.  In effect, you can take your max tolerable dose every ~1-2 hours and likely have minimal atropine-related side-effects.  Of course this will vary significantly by person, but the principle should remain - I do recommend easing into such a schedule in case the duration of action for atropine is longer than expected for you.

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on one's views) I have never needed to do any sort of extraction on these, but I likewise have never come across any mention of such a possibility either despite quite a long tenure on bluelight and drugforums both."

1653,Different feelings on different opioids?,"Hydrocodone is awesome and far from weak. You just have to find the right dose. I actually like it almost as much as oxy. 

Codeine is cool in the relation to Vicodin (hydrocone) as in VI (6 in Roman numerals) and Codin (codeine) = 6 times stronger than Codeine mg to mg. So metabolism aside a Tylenol 3 is SUPPOSED to be 5mg of Hydrocodone.

I normally only take 15mg oxy for a pretty decent buzz since I have no real tolerance. So, 10 mg more of hydro than what I’d take for oxy seems to be good for me for a mild high."
1655,Different feelings on different opioids?,"Well, yes and no.  The main difference of course lies in relative potencies - and with that comes the issues of ROA as well as of codeine metabolism.  For most [white] people with the standard isoforms of the relevant liver enzymes, the conversion is 1:10 into morphine.

So now we're looking at morphine vs oxycodone vs hydrocodone.  They do have some differences in feeling for me, with the rough consensus running that oxycodone is stimulating compared to morphine and hydrocodone which have more of a pure depressant effect.  Due to codeine being a prodrug, it's onset is far slower and thus produces no ""rush"" (as minimal as it is via the oral route) while oxycodone has a rather fast and pronounced impact.  Likewise, there's somewhat of a ceiling effect with codeine simply due to the saturation of the enzymes necessary for conversion to the active morphine metabolite. Hydrocodone lies somewhere in the middle, though I can't comment much from personal experience as it is strangely ineffective for my own issues.  Supposedly it is more similar to codeine than oxycodone, with a much ""warmer"" body high and type of euphoria.  In contrast (as noted), oxycodone is more like taking hydrocodone along with some adderall...

Personally, I have found that 60mg of codeine, which should be roughly equivalent to 6mg morphine (and hence 6mg of hydrocodone - again via oral ROA) or ~4mg oxycodone, just really isn't.  Oxycodone is far more effective, but again, the need for codeine to be metabolized and first-pass-related effects distort the picture quite a bit, making direct comparison almost impossible aside from actual subjective 'testing'

Hope that helps!"

The first two days are the hardest, the third still sucks a bit but is a lot better then the first two, and on the fourth day i usually felt completely normal. And maybe the new Job will take your mind of it and make it a bit easier. Are you planning on staying on it, or do you want to taper suboxone and get off completely? 

In both cases, i would take as little a dose as possible, that still keeps you withdrawal-free and not wanting to do any other opioids. Blasting your receptors with 16mg a day will do you no good, and actually over 8mg a day there is virtually no increase in strength by upping your dose. But hey, whatever your dose, if it stabilizes you and makes your life better, take whatever you need to.

1689,Is there a good way to ween off opiates?,"The 5 days of detox is the easy part.  Its when you start to feel ""better"" at like a few weeks clean is when the real hard part comes. Your brain will be rationalizingthat its okay to use and the first month or two you'll have to fight it constantly.

And in my opinion tapering is just a waste of time. You spend weeks/months dropping your dose but its still gonna be 4-5 days of detoxing. 

 The way drugs get eliminated from our body is not linear. Like 1,000mg doesnt take 10x longer to get out than 100mg.  The way it works is the drugs half life. The 1000mg will go to 500 in one half life while the 100mg only drops to 50.

So basically sinceur only taking say 40mg a day, dropping to 20mg aint gonna make detox noticably easier. I think oxys half life is around 4 hours. Within 4 half lives (16 hours) the 40mg dose is gonna be barely higher level than a 20mg dose."

1695,Is there a good way to ween off opiates?,"I’d just CT it if I were you. Oxy was 5 days of shit at 100mg and then I was ok. Just be ready for 3 days of depression, except you aren’t using everyday so I think you’d be alright."

1698,60 MG extended releass morphine?,"If you haven’t had an opiate in 2 months then 60mg oral morphine should get you pretty high. I ate five of the 30mg morphine ER’s last night (150mg total) and had a decent buzz, and I’m a daily user with a high tolerance. Just eat it and enjoy."

1710,I shot a dirty cotton yesterday and now have have sudden hearing loss in my left ear... should I be worried?,"In a nutshell, yes. Yes I would be worried. 

I personally would toddle off to your GP for investigation. I’m not too sure you have an infection that has caused unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, but it CAN occur with opioid use due to physiological mechanisms that are beyond the scope of this reply. 

An infection seems unlikely as you don’t mention other symptoms. Just the sudden onset hearing loss. 

Time is generally of the essence though. 

Best of luck to you."

The blood supply to the cochlear is *very* small and if it is obstructed due to vasospasm or constriction, damage due to lack of oxygen, can occur relatively quickly. 

It can usually be treated with aggressive, high dose glucocorticoids.

1714,What should I say when I go to urgent care?? Wow this is kind of worrisome I was under the impression maybe just antibiotics would be what they would send me off with,"If it’s an infection, or an obstruction (like a bug crawled in your ear and died or something) yeah antibiotics could work or they’ll just remove the obstruction or wax or whatever. 

But if it (hearing loss) came on basically after you did a shot, it’s not drawing too long a bow to connect the dots. I’d personally be honest and say you did a shot of opioids and were suddenly afflicted with hearing loss. Any doctor worth their salt would be aware of the mechanism behind this and how to treat it. 

Worst case you can always get a cochlear implant. 

It’s what happened to Rush Limbaugh and his penchant for the “oxycotton” caused his hearing loss."

1727,Best way to make tar snortable?,"The only reason you can't snort tar is because of the added water weight, if you have real black tar heroin you just need to find a way to dry it at low heat.

The real good black tar heroin I used to smoke came as clumpy dry powder, I just breathed on it a couple times, it would goo up, and I'd smoke it.

It should all work just fine in reverse. Hopefully that made sense a little buzzed right now and that was a long time ago when I lived out in Cali.

1765,about 100mg of liquid morphine - too much?,i think going over 60 mg first time taking morphine is unwise. i think generally its good to start at around30-50 when you dont have much of a tolerance. if thats not enough you can always take more.
1766,about 100mg of liquid morphine - too much?,I suggest plugging. Oral morphine sucks. As for dosage I have no clue. Look up opioid conversation calculators online and see how much morphine equals your methadone doses. I’d say starting around 40-60mgs would be good then go from there

1769,If I take little I feel a bit better than I take loads.

If you aren't physically addicted to it yet I'd stop and take a tolerance break for either a couple weeks or a month because tolerance is reversible luckily."
1770,Can heroin lose its magic?,"Everything can will lose its magic. Think about sex with someone you find attractive, it’s going to get old. It’s tolerance, it’s novelty, a lot of it has to do with your setting in a familiar setting you aren’t going to feel it as much as a new setting."

I had a few morphine ERs the other day and chewed them up and took them orally, since i don't shoot or have the equipment to boof, and that with the dope had me nodding like never before.

You’d think if everyone loved it, someone would have gotten the idea to move it further into Europe, and if they hated it, someone would have gotten the idea to jump down to Latvia and get some real H.





There has to be a reason. It’s not like fent just showed up in one US state and everyone else said, no thanks and it didn’t spread. And other than a greater language barrier, moving goods from one country to another within the EU is just as easy moving things between US. Why do you think it happened?"

I’d smoked some oxy with my friend a few years back and tried subs a few times way back as well but I knew I should just stay away.

Those numbers started falling in 2010 when the DEA wiped out most pill mills. The doctors being persecuted these days are mostly legitimate. I believe the real reason for the war on opioids is because rx pain killers are no longer profitable. But u know what is?? SUBOXONE. Now they're trying to put everyone on suboxone for things from addiction to chronic pain. And actually, about 90% of all prescribed painkillers go to chronic pain patients and only about 1% of that group ever becomes addicted to or abused their opioids. And they usually don't give their pills away because they need them to live. I should say we bc I fall into this group too. I also fall into the 1% but I'm doing a pretty good job of staying on top of myself lol. But I didn't start taking opioids for fun, it was for pain. And I was an addict long before I ever took my first pain pill. There's a whole group of people who are suffering because of the government's agenda. And with the scarcity of prescription opioids these days, our government is actually pushing more people towards illicit fentanyl."

And yeah ppl are rude here sorry you have that experience. Reeddit in general is full of rude ppl, as is most of the internet. But a forum full of drug addicts sadly can be better or it can be worse of an experience. People suck",Thank you for your honest yet kind response!

1888,Can heroin lose its magic?,"H absolutely loses its magic. Opiates in general do. Eventually doing it occasionally becomes more and more often.

I had a very interesting experience a week ago (I should mention in advance I do my best to use opiates only once a month or so, cause it is my absolute favourite thing in the world and I know I must be super, super, SUPER careful with it. So, that said, my tolerance is still quite good). I started chewing an overall 60 mg amount of oxy over a time period of 3 hours (1 every hour). I documented it in notes on my phone; from about 10:00 in the morning (when I started) up until about 16:00, I was SUPER hyperactive and, of course, heavinly euphoric. But yeah, super energetic.

1946,"I always found methadone to be the most stimulating opioid for me. 10mg and I’d be motivated with a tremendous amount of energy and focus. Oxycodone similarly tends to produce more of a stimulatory effect which is somewhat to be expected I suppose. 

But on methadone I’d have more energy than amphetamine. That’s saying something because I take 60mg of dexamphetamine a day and I can pretty much head back to bed and fall asleep on that. Granted I’ve been on daily amphetamine for over 30 years so I’ve developed a tolerance to its effects, but methadone is my one true love for both analgesia and “getting shit done”.

1988,yes but a *thousand times +* better?,"Well not in the moment but over the entire duration, yes.

An orgasm lasts like 15 seconds max, about 30-60 seconds of actual euphoria. I'm speaking of the male orgasm of course as it's the only one I know.

Opiates on the other hand last hours. And in my opinion, even on a moment to moment basis the opiate high is better than an orgasm. Opiates actually relax your body and mind. For hours. So in a second by second basis, added all up, opiates could be considered to be 1000x more euphoric.

It might just be the fact I'm growing older and that I've jerked off too much (and thus have grown a tolerance to orgasm euphoria), but nowadays the main reason I jerk off is to reduce sexual tension, not to orgasm. I mean the orgasm still feels good, but it's mostly the relief of my mind not being consumed by sexual fantasies that I'm after, not the orgasm itself. 

Something else that's interesting is that the urge/desire tk use opiates almost never disappoints while horniness/sexual desire is usually stronger than the actual orgasm. Like, the excitement to use opiates is in balance with their euphoria while sexual desire is usually way stronger than the actual orgasm."

Another great example would be DMT and some of the other psychedelics.  Like when someone tries DMT for the first time they don’t shut up for months to anyone who will listen. Many are afraid or are doubtful of people claims and maybe we are just a bunch of idiots for ingesting these substances. Time will tell.

Like just the fact that existence existed and I had eyes and a brain to process everything, was enough to make me almost deleriously happy and content.

I mean, I know that's objectively what I did during the peak of my high, but my mind remembers the traveling as though it was fucking Mr. Rogers neighborhood - the subway car felt like it was floating on air, the bus smelled like beautiful humanity and the seat was super comfy, popping out if the Lincoln tunnel into Jersey I couldn't stop smiling at all the sites, the people walking around, everything felt like a dream. The 30 min of walking felt like 5, and I'm pretty sure I gave an emphatic ""hey man!"" to every person I passed on the street of this urban Jersey town, and nothing bothered me at all. And nothing was bleak. Decrepit buildings and shady looking peo ppl around? No, more like amazing pieces of history, and beautiful lives being lived on another beautiful day of existence.

2039,Would it be accurate to say that opiates make you feel like a kid on Christmas again? That’s the best way I can explain it when people who are opiate naive ask me how it feels,"In the UK there was an advert for Ready Brek.
It would show a glow around the cartoon who’d just eaten and call it the “ Ready Brek glow” 
A warmth and energy boost of sorts. We call having opiades, or more accurately heroin in my case, as getting the Ready Brek glow!!!
I’m a 25 year addict and find life without it gets very boring very quickly but I prefer that to the misery of addiction. However, I still find myself going back to it. Today I did as many addicts do, I told myself that since I’ve been good for nearly a month now I can treat myself to a hit. So I got myself some crack and smack, prepared my snowball or speedball as it’s called in the USA and had a very satisfying hit. Problem 
is now though that I find myself really wanting another and am battling with a decision. 
Do I go to the poker night I’ve had planned with my pals for over a week now or do I go and get more crack and smack.
I’ll probably end up getting the drugs after the poker.
I say all this as I knew I’d want more but told myself the lie that it’s only gonna be the ONE hit.
That is the addict mentally... we are such good liars that we believe our own lies.
So if you want to describe the feeling I’d say “ It’s a nice warm feeling but you will want and need more every time you have it.
I’d also let people know the feeling of withdrawal if I only had the words to explain that feeling to anyone that’s not been through it. I’d say it’s horrible/nasty/ painful and vomit and diarrhoea causing enough that the most decent people in the world will usually resort to stealing out of a family members purse or wallet.
I’m a director of a successful hotel and student accommodation company. My siblings drive cars worth the average suburban house if put together. Because of my addiction I share my wife’s car l, live payday to payday and have in a way been banished to another city with the excuse from my folks that that’s where we’re expanding the biz to.
Still, even though I’m part of all that, going into a shopping mall and taking sunglasses and perfumes or anything else that sells easily is not beneath me if I’m broke.
Sorry it’s so long but I feel there’s an important point to get across.
Otherwise, enjoy getting John folks, but do it for fun, not because you have to just to function.

Has anyone else noticed a subtle degradation of our society? I'm not even that old but it's obvious how different Christmas was when I was 10 in the 2000s vs now.

Christmas is still fun but that's only due to my immediate family (which is still fractured by a divorce). What the fuck happened?

Is this why we use opiates? Because everything's falling apart? Or is it just aging? When I was a kid, the entire month of October had this sense of Halloween in the air. It was a cheerful, fake spooky, the best kind of spooky. And it'd climax on Halloween. It was amazing.

Same with Christmas. This awesome and beautiful Christmas cheer all December long. And the closer you got to Christmas the more the cheer spread, it was infectious. It'd be a couple days before Christmas and you'd see people on the street and you couldn't stop smiling and wishing them a Merry Christmas.

By the time I'd turned 16, the adults were already talking about how things had changed.   


Personally, I think when you give someone a crutch, they'll use it.

Trials that seem daunting while sober are re-written in a language that is easily comprehended. The euphoria that is felt is unmatched and underestimated. It is that feeling that consumes and does not release. Instead of just a great feeling, opiates internalize and become part of a person's emotional response. While having the ability to bring one up, down and manipulates in order to do ANYTHING to get that euphoric feeling back.  Over time, opiates begin to quickly siphon up all of the time and energy within our day. From sun up to sun down, we yearn for that feeling until it ends.

I was banging Carfentanil for a while and, after I got past the phase of shooting up and then waking up bleeding on the floor hours later, which seemed to last about a week, I got some decent euphoria with crazy legs, but it still didn’t touch Heroin.  After that, I finally found a real consistent Heroin connect and shit was testing like ~93% most of the time, no joke.  My tolerance had gotten to the point, though, where my serum levels were at 1,000+ bags of Heroin a day.

2140,Best and worst 10MG/325 oxy?,"While there may be differences in excipients, binders, fillers and so on which may cause a slight difference in onset for example, provided the active ingredients are the same and in the same doses, they are bio equivalent. 

10mg of oxycodone is 10mg of oxycodone is 10mg of oxycodone. 

People have their preferences or brand loyalty which is understandable, but your opioid receptors aren’t particularly fussed over the brand, they care about the molecule. Not the name on the box that contains said molecule."

There is a +/- threshold for all pills as far as Opiate content extends.  Actavis and Mallinckrodt tends to always be on the higher end of that range.  The fillers between manufacturers also differs and those two manufacturers seem to have the least fillers as well as the least harmful fillers (some fillers used by other manufacturers have nasty side effects like turning your tum tum sideways)."

2161,How long do the effects of sniffing fent last for the majority of you fine people?,"Fent patches have fentanyl citrate in them

Street drugs have any of like 20 common fent analogues in them. Some like carfentanil have an 8 hour half life (heroin/morphine has a 4 hour half life, so yes this kind of fent lasts like 3x longer than heroin).

Its like how an opiate drug test will show positive from heroin or morphine or codeine and probably opium too.  Saying ""fent sucks"" or fent only lasts 30 mins"" is like someone trying codeine and saying all opiates are weak and suck.  Another example is how oxycodone and oxy morphine are both cousin opioids. Or hydrocodone and hydromorphone.  

When a drug is tweaked it can act completely different than the original analogue.  They were tweaking opana/oxymorphone back 80 years ago and thats when they first found narcan. Yes narcan was made out of opana.

Google images for oxymorphone molecule and naloxone molecule.  Look at how similar they are to each other except a minor tweak, and the result is a completely different drug."

edit: I did some googling. So the deal with #3 is that it's basic and needs an acid added before it will dissolve in water. #4 is a salt so it's ready to go without any extra prep."

You use Vitamin C or really any acidifier to break it down into water as Diacetylmorphine base isn’t really soluble in water.  This is done primarily when shooting it, though.

If you’re taking it rectally, I believe the mucus membrane in the rectum is lipid-permeable meaning that #3 would absorb on its own.  Injecting anything with an acidifier hurts like hell, but injecting that in your bum would likely give you fire hole (and possibly an infection)."

2197,"  Yeah, people hate on fentanyl, but besides the super short duration, I love it.  Yrs back I got a deal of a lifetime on 6 boxes (30 patches) of the Duagesic 75mcg/hr, and 6-800mcg Actiq lozenges for $100🙆
   Def a blessing, but also a curse!  I was getting some real good Heroin for dirt cheap cuz my dopeman was in a tough spot and I let him post up in my spare room at my apartment for a few Mo's. Rent free. I could do . 25/.30 shots of the dope while my friend's would be hit on a tenth/G, I got 2 the point were I'd take a dab of gel out of a patch and mix it in with my heroin as I was prepping a shot... I'd chew 1/3-1/2 a patch just to get motivated for an 8 hr shift at work... bring a fent sucker and some dope w/me, so I could dose fent while working and shoot dope on my breaks.. lol
   I sold 4 Actiq lozenges and 5 patches for $275, & went through the rest like water... Then I ran out!  A gram of fire would last me like 12 hrs, luckily once a month I'd get gifted 15-40mg Opana yellow stop signs, but without dope and super potent opioids in combo I would go through hellish wd's!!  Ended up going to an inpatient rehab (got an ultimatum from the g/f... I was pissed at the time, but I was rx'd 2mg kpins that I took  alongside the fent , dope, and opana.. so I'm sure I was acting like a fuckin retard-zombie!!!) Worst part is I got clean,  stayed that way for almost a 2yrs, had my 1st & only child and was engaged to b married! Thought things were looking up, then my Dad passed very unexpectedly, and 40 days later my wife to be got tboned, and passed away as well! Went from being a addict POS, to clean, happy, and in love with my fiancee,  with my only child.. felt truly like the luckiest man on earth!  To losing everyone I had except my son(thank god!!!) my mom passed of cancer 5 yrs earlier.
  So I started going hard with every drug I could get my hands on!! Lucky my big sister was so amazing w/my son, she wanted children, but couldn't due 2 medical reasons.  So she loved my son like he was her own child!
   I was 31 now, my son was almost 3, never been arrested, or even a speeding ticket.
  Now always in the hood scoring/using dope, I got caught w/unregistered handgun, syringe(s), heroin, oxycodone, methamphetamine, paraphernalia, and Marijuana (5 felonies, and 2 misdemeanors) blew my life savings on attorneys and fees/fines, did 225 days behind bars, got out clean again (not by choice) son was 4 now, and my sister adopted my son so he wouldn't be a ward of the state.

2241,Highest tolerance you’ve achieved?,It’s strange but I’ve been a regular Kratom user daily for 3 years and as baby shit as Kratom is and not even an opiate technically I think just works on opiate receptors it has entirely jacked my tolerance.

About 2-3 weeks ago I started sniffing fentanyl powder or analogue idkcif irs rly fent idk how to tell it powerful as fuck tho but after copping like 7-8 times I find my tolerance is already sky high and I have to sniff decent amount to get high.

I’ve had super shitty sobriety where I’d be suicidal but have no cravings to use.

On suboxone again for the last 2 years but that 3.5 years of real sobriety gave me some tools to keep working on myself and be happy"

2325,Do you know what the best part about being sober is?,"Sounds like such a nightmare. The other way of obtaining is the way to go as far as reliability and quality but it gets old quick too. 

Being sober and enjoying music and sensations again is great. Drinking with friends without feeling muscle aches or an extra terrible withdrawal hangover in the morning. etc etc

It's so fucking annoying. I'm a junkie and I dont act that way or pull that shit, so I dont have sympathy, patience or understanding for people who do.

There are cops around all the time, but I love the rush of scoring. It’s similar to when I used to shoplift as a teenager for fun, gets me awake and alert. I feel like it’s benefits my everyday life a lot, I can feel when someone is lying and if someone is a danger now. I like fighting too, but I’m a pacifist by nature, just if someone else wants to go there I don’t mind because there’s a part of me that is uber violent and really enjoys a good conflict, unless I’m the one holding.

My life is a complete waste of potential, I wasn’t taught what I needed to be taught and I wasn’t aggressive enough with my own studies. There is no tribe anymore, there are no elders, the villages have burned and it’s everyone for themselves. I’m not depressed at all though, even if my thoughts are far from it. I’m actually a happy person stuck in a shit life.  I’ve lost all faith in humanity and my faith in my self is stronger than the faith most people have in themselves and that terrifies the shit outta me, because I have very little. How can a person make clear decisions if they don’t believe in their perception of reality? They can’t and they don’t, everyone walks around in a cloudy ass haze and I can’t be around that shit unless I’m using something.  I’m trying to quit, but I’m pretty fucked as I can walk 10 minutes from my job and I’m near it.  I think I’ll have to change my job and city and really need to get away from people for my work.

When you start to fix these problems that were there from before that you ignored or escaped from things will get much better and being sober will be easier once your life sober improves. If you fix things and have a good life, you are way more likely to see the bigger picture and be less inclined to use.

People say things get better sober. Yes they do, and it takes time but its a lot of effort. It sucks but simply jusy being sober is not enough, what is important is recovery and they are not the same.

It may feel like you're just as hopeless as before except now you don't have anything to numb the pain/make you feel better, but that's not true. When people say they are functioning addicts, they are functioning to the level that they have set in mind by a certain standard to be functional. What I mean by that is, you might measure functional by keeping a job and having a house, car etc or whatever. The truth is when you are an addict, it's impossible to fix the things in life that can make your life better in fact at best you are pausing time and not making things worse.

 Now that you're sober it will take a long time to accept and move on. The only way to do so is to start by forgiving yourself. Forgiveness is not a one time thing that is in an instant that you say it and it's over, you have to remind yourself everyday. Once you forgive yourself you'll start caring about yourself and realise your worth and now since you have started loving yourself, it will become a lot easier moving forward as your decisions will start to take shape of someone who has themselves as their best interest.

I think i'll stop rambling actually.. I know getting told this stuff sucks listening to because you feel like complete shit at the time."
2340,Do you know what the best part about being sober is?,"I couldn’t have done all that shit without drugs. Today the anxiety would give me a panic attack. 

It’s all good with a regular dealer. I had one who had a straight f/t job. We would pay him every fortnight, and every day at 6am he would drop off deals for us on his way to work. That was living!  ....scoring off randoms in the middle of a dodgy suburb is stressful, even when you’re dressed down, and a regular."
2341,Do you know what the best part about being sober is?,"I always hated those people. When I sold I would go out of my way to help people out at the few that tried to fuck me over were literally trash. 

Why even do that? Treat people right and they keep coming back and making you money, treat them like shit and steal from them and yay you made an extra 20 today but what about tomorrow when they don't come back?

Slinging dope is a business just like any other, if people realized that and treated it as such we'd all be better off"

I don't know how to put it in words man, I've just had enough and I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I have lived in misery for too long and I'm trying to fix the main issues that have caused me to end up where I am drugs just get in the way of all of that for me. 

Crazy thing is the more I stay sober, the more I realise how much in denial I was and how fucked my perception was.","oh wow, well i plan on doing each one just once to understand how they feel, but id use stimulants occasionally (on birthdays etc), they help with depression too yes?"

I don't believe they help with depression, I mean yeah when you take them they make you feel like your depression is better because you're under there influence, but you haven't fixed shit. I mean in the same way opiates help too, because they numb you from your depression, but all of that shit is just temporary. It's not actually helping you and eventually you'll have to deal with it or keep suffering even if its yeara down the line.

If you use them once in a long time there's no harm, but once you're an addict then things change I guess. Controlled responsible use + something horrible unrelated happening in your life unexpectedly out of your control can lead to bad addiction when everything goes out the window and you try cope .

Shit happens man, think about it nobody really sets out to become an addict. It creeps up on you, a dangerous time is when you've been using responsibly for so long and start to think you can always be in control and that you're different from other people. 

Basically the one thing I like about NA which is the reason I go is because listening to other people's experiences makes you realise that fuck, I'm not alone with how I feel. Non-addicts just can never understand what an addict feels or goes through. Someone can tell their experience and it will almost feel surreal that they don't know you at all, but they've word for word narrated an experience or behaviour that 100% describes yours as if they were speaking about you.."

in a trauma case like that id probably try harmless stuff like st johns wort (or weed if im older) in high doses as its not an overdose because it doesnt really matter if im addicted and when i lower the doses at least i know what im going to have to face or if it doesnt help id see a doctor/therapist

when im not depressed i might take it on occasion (birthdays etc) but a stimulant would probably better fit for those parties

2359,Is it a thing to expect Fent when you buy oxy pills?,I think it's better to assume there could be fent and test everything. It only takes a few mg of product. Test every new batch you buy. First with a kit and then a smaller dose.

I have one street dealer who can get as many real 30s as you want, never runs dry.  He is a Yemeni dude, though, from a family that owns 30+ bodegas in Manhattan.  He also has turbo high-quality fishscale for $40 a gram.  Best weed and edibles you’ve ever seen at bargain basement prices.  Dudes wired up like a modem, so much so it’s actually kind of scary."

2374,Is Methadone an Option?,Ahhhhhh. I know I'll prolly get slack for this comment but imo you never really have yourself back until your free from all substances.  Now don't get me wrong.  Suboxone/sublocade gave me the opportunity to get my life back on track but I still don't feel like I have myself back.  Shit I've been doing opiates so long I dont even know what it even feels like to be sober. I cannot wait till the day when I'm really free.  All that shit blocks emotions. Yeah I lowered my dose and they came back a little but I can only imagine being completely free. I swear times I got bailed out and was clean (forced to kick) the air smelt different.  My home smelt different.  Hard to explain but alot of shit feels different when your 100% clean...  not bashing anything cause like I said I am on sublocade and suboxone b4 that and it's been a God sent. Seriously I have improved my current life as well as I am getting well prepared for old age. I couldn't do that while on dope.

Making it hard to travel or work because of restriction. I see it as a way to get mine from the unwanted of society. If it works for you and that upur jouney all the best but were i live ive seen doctors put people on methadone and suboxone for crack addiction. Make little sense and then they on on for years and maybe the rest of there lives with daily visits to pharmacies and weekly doctors visits cause they are not clean.

Next time we go we'll ask for 29 gauge points. But being a certified phlebotomist, I know pretty much everything I need to know about needles and getting a vein. I've been an IV drug user for 11 years now, and there is definitely something different about the insulin needles they're selling now. Only a single Walmart in our city would sell bags of 10. All other Walmart's required you to buy a box of 10 bags. Every other pharmacy required you to have a diabetic card or they **would not** sell you points. 
But recently, just in the past 7 or months, you are able to buy them anywhere. HEB, CVS, Walgreens, etc.... idk if it has something to do with needle exchanges being legal in our city now, but it might. Certain Walgreens locations are now charging $10 for a bag of 10 points now, as opposed to the normal $3 for a bag. Which is just outrageous.
Ever since they started selling points everywhere, it's like they've made them harder to use for the purpose of abusing drugs. Like my gf said, they go dull **SUPER** fast. And sometimes a fresh point will clog the very first time you use it. 
And it's not like were doing dope that's filled with  lactose which is guaranteed to clog a 31 gauge.
We're doing BTH with literally no lac in it whatsoever. And sometimes they arent even really clogged, they just refuse to register. And if they do, it's an extremely slow register to the point where you cant even tell if it's in or not. We used to be able to use the same rig 10 times before tossing it. But that's out of the question now. They have, without a doubt, changed something about the insulin needles. Maximum uses out of a point now is 3 times. When it used to be the **MINIMUM** amount of uses we'd get out of one was 10. I swear we were able to use the same rig for like 25 times if we really needed to.

You're right about no way to control it - I have heard that ""chippers"" exist, and I'm sure they do somewhere, but the only people I've met who dabble in H without getting hooked have been hard-core alcoholics who don't get hooked on H because alcohol is their DOC. 

>Starting to get tiresome and feels like I’ll be like this forever.

I know the feeling, man. Sometimes, getting an overwhelming sense of despair and getting, as they say in AA, ""sick and tired of being sick and tired"" can be a galvanizing moment that you can use to propel yourself to quit. 

As for me, I keep stopping and relapsing constantly. Since I started at age 20 (I'm 26 now) the longest I've stayed clean is 7 months in rehab, and outside of rehab the longest I've gone is 4 months. I've spent a year clean in month-long stretches divided by briefer relapses, and have done countless fortnights + weeks clean before breaking again. For all of 2018 I was in a really regular pattern of using for 3-7 days, stopping and trying to stay stopped for 1-4 weeks and then relapsing again. Since the lapses were relatively short I managed to keep my shit kind of together. I have the easiest job in the world since I work at a cinema, so thankfully I didn't lose my job since it didn't matter if I was at work high off my ass, stone cold sober, sick as fuck or even at the tail end of a speed ball binge since a chimpanzee could do my job. 

I wouldn't have called it being a functional addict since my life was pretty shitty for a 26 year old who always had high ambitions, but it wasn't spiraling out of control either. I'm right now though in the worst relapse I've had in years, catalyzed by the stupid decision I made while I was high to let a friend of mine who also uses come and live with me, resulting in a 3 month bender. I really need to pull this back *now*, since the consequences are starting to get really severe. I am on the verge of being evicted from my flat, I'm on my final warning at work, I owe a lot of money to relatives - it's just all pretty fucked, so I have to make a concerted effort to put a stop to this now and get some sobriety back.

Didn't mean to write an essay, but it felt good to vent, and I appreciate you asking. How long have you been doing this comrade? How old are you??"

This is not the life that you want.  This is just what feels good right now and comfortable.  It’s heroins ability to not just block physical pain but our mental and emotional pains.   Emotional withdrawal is stronger than the physical.  That’s why you’ll hear of many people who successfully quit explaining the feeling being similar to breaking up with a significant other or losing a best friend.   It can always get worse.   Don’t wait till rock bottom bc you might experience things you could’ve done without and will have many stories you should never share with people who love you.   That square one feeling odd very mutual, my friend.  I could be ready to die through WD for my family, thoroughly convinced myself I will never touch again, and then soon after, cravings get so bad it’s like my body is craving food but cannot be satiated.   

Maintenance drugs are hard af to kick too so if that’s your route, two weeks max.   I was “sober” for two years on Suboxone (decided to taper and quit when I realized how dirty a suboxone doc.  He was actually upset I was taking less than 8mg a day and insisted that the plan was to be his cash patient forever) and now I have to kick this and it’s gna be long af before I kick (day 20).  

I’m just prepared to suffer bro.   I can barely enjoy life and my testosterone level so low I can hardly get out of bed and losing weight like a mofo.   But it’s gotten better since the first week and I know it’ll only get better from here on, but I walk just as slippery slope as you, my friend.  You’re so young brov.  When I was 20, Drugs were a way for me to connect with people, party with hot chicks, community, etc.   I was a very ambitious and smart kid who set himself up for success but let drugs take it all away.   Building myself up from scratch.  (Emotional pain of what could’ve been).   Like you said tho bro, just got man the fuck up.   A $20 sack smoked could probably keep my fried all fckin day bc of how low my tolerance probably is now.   And I’d more relief and happiness and warmth Than I can remember.   But I gotta man the eff up.   And handle this shit.  Because for you to get right in the head, you need months off this shit.  And to be truly back to normal, I think it takes two years. And I’m headstrong.  Spent 8 months of this year building my physique in the gym and I’m prepared to sacrifice all my gains and get fat for this.  (At least that’s what I tell myself today).  

Honestly bro, I wake up after like 2-4 hours of the worst sleep but I start my day off praying to God to help me be victorious until noon, then at lunch, pray for strength to make it to dinner (im probably eating close to nothing at these meals bc of WD)   I ask God to remind me that’s it’s a matter of “yes vs no” and that it does get better.  That I deserve to suffer and deal with my issues the hard way or this experience won’t make me stronger. And remember to be Thabkful for your family.  I imagine the roles of me and my loved ones reversed and it helps keep things in perspective.  overthinking shit = creating problems that don’t even exist.  Stay up bud.  God bless."

When you know your days are numbered, then why not try and experience the most pleasurable experience you possibly can? I understand wanting to spend your last days with loved ones, but if it were me I'd want to take some time for myself at some point and feel the most intensely, hedonistically pleasurable experience that it's humanly possible to feel, knowing that my impending death would mean I'm insulated from any of the normal consequences that may restrain someone not in that situation. Just a thought, brother."
2451,"Holy fuck, man.

As far as the speedball, I guess you could say I am prescribed goofballs.  Granted, I don't shoot them, but I take morphine and adderall almost every day.  

I truly only want to love and be loved at this point.  I have already vastly outlived my prognosis.  Tomorrow will be 2 years ago that the 'mass' in my head was confirmed to be cancer.  They expected me to live for 'a couple of months'.

Every now and then when I just can't stop thinking about my impending death, I'll put the morphine, adderall, and an ativan into an oral syringe, and boof that shit to escape for a little while, but for the most part, it's the bare minimum of all 3.  I've been a stay at home dad for every day of my twin sons' lives, I want to be present for as much of whatever I have left."
2452,"I'd really like to quit, but I doubt that is possible.  I've been prescribed opiates for the last 15 years for various medical issues.  Currently, I am taking them for pain caused by brain cancer.  

Some days I can manage without taking any, luckily my anti-seizure med can kill withdrawals, but those days are very few.  Most of my life is spent in a slight morphine haze.

Unfortunately, this cancer will kill me, it's just a matter of when.  So my last dose will likely be immediately before I die at a young age.",I’m so sorry! I can’t imagine what you’re going through and you should absolutely not worry about becoming addicted given your circumstances. Don’t suffer unnecessarily please.

However the kpins don't work 100% when I fly, so eventually I mixed in some oxy and I was calm, relaxed, no anxiety at all. Also mix em to get rid of social anxiety, it really helps. Never went passed 30mg oxy and 1.5mg kpins in a day. Love em, but the constipation sucks lol.

If so then be really, really careful. I can guarantee that the vast majority of us would kill to be in your position, since you are in that glorious position where your brain hasn't decided that opiates are vital to its survival yet, so at the moment you can pick up & put down oxy without suffering the physical repercussions. The key part there is *at the moment*. The distinction between the purely recreational user that can binge for weeks at a time with nothing but a little depression afterwards and the rest of us who can't spend a weekend nodding out without having to go through 5 days of hell for our sins is a one-way street - it's a binary, all-or-nothing situation. 

If you go just a little too far and increase your dose by a few pills or use far a couple of days longer than usual then you can cross the line, open up Pandora's box and get to experience your very first opiate withdrawal. If at that point your daily using streak had only been a couple of weeks then your withdrawal may be relatively mild - still really unpleasant & nasty, but not the full on agony of a long-term addict going cold turkey. However, after your first withdrawal, your brain & body will be primed for it, and you know then that if you use for that period of time again you'll get that sickness again, only this time it could come even if your binge was a day or two earlier than the last one. Then the next time you'll find yourself getting sick after using for just a week, and the withdrawal will be getting more & more intense every time even if your binges are shorter. The withdrawals will hit faster & harder as time goes on, until inevitably you will reach your nadir. 

For most of us opiate users the end point is that every time they use for 3 days they will then have to go through withdrawal (though some of our unluckier comrades get it after 2 days, and you even hear of people being thrown into withdrawal after using for a single day!). You will look back fondly at these days where you could play with opiates like others can with weed, booze, coke etc. since after that first withdrawal every single time you indulge in your oxys you'll have the looming threat of the sickness hanging over your head, and as you probably know, it's very easy to tell yourself you'll just use for one or two days, but it's a lot harder to actually say no when the third day rolls around. 

If my read of the situation is right and you are in that blessed situation where you have yet to get opiate WD for the first time, tread really, really carefully, because after that first withdrawal you can't go back. If you exert self-control and discipline and just make sure you never go overboard and get your first withdrawal, then opiates can remain a fun indulgence rather than something inextricably linked to the sickness & desperation that turns good men into thieving criminals, modest women into street walking prostitutes & kids into corpses."

Please man, don't make the mistake that I have personally made and that countless other users have made. We binge for a long period of time, we stop, we feel basically fine, so we assume that we are immune to opiate withdrawals, that our body chemistry is different, that our brains must be wired differently so we don't get the sickness that other junkies do. It's a nice thought, a comforting one, but it's a delusion! It's an easy trap to fall into but it's simply not true. Before my first real withdrawal, I would binge for weeks at a time. I used daily for six weeks at one point and then stopped and just had some mild restlessness, yawned a lot and felt a little uncomfortable. ""Huh"", I thought, ""this is it?? I guess I just don't get real withdrawals!"". This emboldened me to continue pushing it, and each long, uninterrupted binge that ended with just a few days of the mildest discomfort lulled me into a false sense of security. I genuinely wondered if maybe all junkies just massively exaggerated the scope of withdrawals, but then settled on the thought that maybe my body chemistry just meant that my experience of withdrawals wouldn't be too bad. 

**I was wrong.** I eventually went on a binge, stopped, and then immediately knew something was different. Something was wrong. I tried to shake it off, but then what had been mild discomfort every other time quickly turned into a horrible mental & physical ordeal, and I soon realized how foolish I had been to assume that what I had gone through before was indicative of withdrawal, how naive I had been to assume that I was special. Opiates can wrap you in a heavenly warm embrace and give you so much, but when they turn on you they can bring you to your knees. Please, be under no illusions. You have yet to experience any withdrawal, but you are not different, or immune. You have just not crossed that line yet. if you are careful, you need never cross it, but you will be much more likely to not have to go through withdrawal if you always bear in mind that it's something that **will** happen if you aren't cautious, and then after it's happened once you will not be able to enjoy opiates in the same carefree way again. Please, be cautious, buddy."

It's a bitch, isn't it? To those around us, it looks as if we are choosing this life, and in a way we are. What they don't understand, however, is that the choice we make to use drugs is not the same as their choice to, for example, have a bagel in the morning or drink a couple of beers. It's a choice but there's an enormous emotional and unconscious weight behind it and the conscious part of it is less of a decision of whether or not to use and more like a decision to either resign to what a loud screaming voice in our minds is telling us we really want or to battle against it constantly. That's why the people around us who don't use get so frustrated, I guess - they can't understand that it's not as simple as ""Just don't take the drugs anymore"". Everyone has a divided mind between their impulsive self and their higher self - that's why people slip on their diets, skip a jog, procrastinate etc. but with addicts the impulsive side has so, so much more power because the drugs so directly tap into that primal part of our brain associated with pleasure, compulsion & need that it often feels to me as if the conscious, rational part of my mind is a like a man trying to hold back a tidal wave with a shower curtain. 

I've heard many people speak of crack in those kind of disparaging terms! It's just so hard to turn down, isn't it? I don't have so much of a problem with crack - I do it pretty much every time I do H, but because of the H I don't get the crash and overwhelming impulse to keep doing more so I can use a moderate amount just to spice up my shots and it mixes really pleasantly with the H. 

I admire your candor and honesty about opiates. I feel like a lot of users may feel the same way, but because of cultural & societal pressure feel the need to pay lip-service to a desire to quit even when they don't actually have that. 

Interesting about your perspective on crack vs meth. We don't really have meth here in the UK and so I've never tried it so I'm interested - can you tell me how the 2 compare?"

To be honest though you sound like a pretty functional user, but as you've acknowledged it's a dangerous game - it's walking a tight rope whilst juggling, and it only takes the right confluence of circumstances to potentially make one of your runs become extended to the point where you have serious negative consequences. 

I think the part about loving H is what a lot of non-addicts don't get. They just see the negatives and can't understand why we would continue doing it to ourselves. They see how fucked up our lives can get, and can't grasp why we would continue, and it's impossible to communicate to someone who hasn't tried it (especially if they're pretty straight and haven't even experimented much with drugs) how it can be so compelling that people can throw their whole lives away in pursuit of it. The harsh truth is that shooting H feels better in a hedonistic yet deeply primal way than anything else in life, and it's so hard to forget that and try to live a normal life. Once you've tasted heaven, how can you come back down to earth and go on as if you don't know what it's like to feel such a deep sense of warmth, contentment and bliss & try to replace it with the materialistic and average trappings of a normal life?

It doesn’t matter what other people think. They don’t understand the difference between addiction and dependence, let alone the intricacies of your mental health.

Then it’s easy, but I don’t like to do that, I like to have a mountain of stuff to sit on. The other options are lame... kratom, subs, done. So really if I continue it’s either get tech savvy or BTH, which has been my go to for a fix, but I’m really bad with it as I get to a carpet surfing point when I quit, which I only get like that with crack binges to say how bad it can be. I’ve IVed before but not really H, just coke and meth, except in the past there was about 15 times I IV H before I had a tolerance or dependence. My point being if I cross that line again, I’ll be in serious shit. So this is my first serious quit for the time being, but I was pretty dedicated the past 5 years, pretty much everyday I had some form of opioid even if it was weak, I don’t know I’m really just trying on sobriety again. See if it fits, I don’t think relapse or withdrawals are good for a person. I think it’s much preferable to stay well or nothing.

It must be so much harder when you have a legit pain reason to quit, and tbh if I had chronic pain then I wouldn't see a reason to stop. On the bright side, developments are being made for alternate painkillers, and it's likely in the next decade or so non-opioid effective painkillers will come to market. Research is being done into pharmaceuticals that mimic the painkilling effects of opioids but separate the high/addiction/withdrawal that comes with it, since the mechanism by which morphine and other opiates kill pain is actually distinct from the pharmacodynamic by which it produces a high. There is even preliminary evidence to suggest that the endorphin receptors which are implicated in dependence & withdrawal are a different subset to the ones that produce the euphoria, which could mean in the future we may have opiates that give the high without the dependence. However, this is all future speculation, and for the present if you have chronic pain and opiates alleviate that then I think you should have unfettered, permanent access to them. I hope you have an understanding doctor and aren't forced to score your opiates off the street when there's a legitimate medical reason for you having them?"

This, around 10 years now (13 years before that full-on using). I *can* do a few months clean but sooner or later, I'm chipping again. Basically because boredom. Only way I'll eliminate H is to live a very fullfilling life; failed that so far.  

On one level I do OK; securely housed with a steady income from my rental. No dependants so I can chill with a little effort. But an idle mind is the devil's workshop... No purpose or passion, a self-centered wasted life.

This, around 10 years now (13 years before that full-on using). I *can* do a few months clean but sooner or later, I'm chipping again. Basically because boredom. Only way I'll eliminate H is to live a very fullfilling life; failed that so far.  

On one level I do OK; securely housed with a steady income from my rental. No dependants so I can chill with a little effort. But an idle mind is the devil's workshop... No purpose or passion, a self-centered wasted life.

I don't buy that having no children means you've wasted your life.

I take hydrocodone as prescribed along with lyrica and tizanidine and Celebrex. I don’t want the pain but the opiates help take some of it away so I don’t think I’ll ever stop unless I get cut off like many pain patients seem to or unless it magically disappears. I tried every other option available to me except for a spinal cord stimulator so I’m sort of stuck where I am. I’ve had cancer too and this is so much worse, thankfully kicked that to the curb.

That said I have a great job, marriage and son. I do most of the things I did before getting crps thanks to the opiate (when I don’t take it in addition to the others I can’t function so I know that’s what helps the most).

Believe me, I know about the pain of arterial shots.

Que him claiming that an arterial shot would be superior to a skin-pop since you still get the rush with the former, and that's what caused this whole argument."

I was just saying that the really intense painful part doesn't last very long. although tbh, saying that, if hypothetically after the horribly painful part of an artery shot it was then literally the exact same feeling as a normal IV of H and I was on day 3 of cold turkey and having one of those days where I am suffering the peak of withdrawals, holding the cure in my hand but can't hit a vein to save my life then I think I would hit the artery and endure 30 seconds of pain if it was followed by the H rush and the cure to my withdrawal, but that's just hypothetical since as everyone who IVs other than Big Silly knows, hitting an artery doesn't give you a rush!"

Hence, I did some Internet research and found this:

>Like me and plenty of my old drug friends used to hit arteries all the time. This was before we had the internet. We were all young and completely stupid so I began hitting veins and arteries with an empty needle so I could show my “friends” what the difference was between vein blood and arterial blood. None of us…7 in total ever had any problems besides missing the rush.  ([source](https://www.quora.com/What-happens-if-I-shoot-meth-in-an-artery))

I knew because as soon as it popped in, it instantly filled with bright red blood and the plunger almost exploded out of the rig.

It might just come on a little slower I would guess. :)"

I've hit an artery a few times, but these days if the blood flow is particularly strong or the blood looks too bright i inject the tiniest little bit to test if I'm in an artery so I don't put much in there. The first time I did it though I'd been poking myself for over half an hour, and was so excited to finally get blood (and having never hit an artery before) I immediately pushed the plunger down quickly, and I literally screamed out in pain before I even realized what was happening, as well as actually involuntarily tearing the needle out of my arm and throwing it across the room. I didn't even do that consciously and would never have done that since there was someone in the room with me (it didn't go near them thankfully) but the burning pain was so intense I did it without thinking. Thankfully the pain passes in a few seconds, but that few seconds literally feel like the inside of your arm has become a chemical fire with a really sharp & intense agonizing pain. It was probably made worse by the fact this was back in the earlier days when I was putting *way* too much citric in my shots. Almost immediately my arm started swelling with these giant blotchy patches and my hand inflated to 3x its size. I thought I'd have to call an ambulance, but I googled it and found that it would resolve itself pretty quickly, which it did. I slowly got the effect of the shot, but there was definitely no rush. Since then I've never put a whole shot in an artery, but when I've done little test pushes into suspect spots that may be a vein or an artery a similar thing has happened, but never any rush.

I just need my fellow junkies who are long term IV users to back me up here, since I *know* I'm fuckin right but he won't believe me and like I said, Google is no help. We've even got a bet with a bag of H riding on this now, so I hope my fellow /r/opiates users come and back me up !"

Even if it did give a rush, what's the upside?","We've both been at this for a few years, and here in the UK to make the H injectable you need to add Vit C/citric acid so its soluble. Years of injecting an acidic solution of heroin + crack takes its toll on your veins and it can get very difficult finding them. Many, many users turn to getting giant 2ml syringes and hitting their femoral, but that's a line we never want to cross (seen too many one-legged junkies in wheelchairs for that), so he said when he's really sick if he can't find a vein he will go in an artery since they're really easy to find + hit.

I was in a room with someone else as well, thankfully he wasn't in front of the needle's trajectory. I could have been in a room full of toddlers (though it would be pretty weird to be shooting up there if I was) and nothing could have made me not violently toss that needle, it was completely reflexive and unconscious. After the first time the only other significant artery hit I had was when I was doing a speedball with coke + H and the numbing of the coke stopped me feeling the initial pain. These days I always check for a pulse before I insert the spike, since where there's an artery there's always a pulse - sometimes strong, sometimes faint, but always there. I've hit nerves a few times too which is like an electric shock but it's nothing on the pain of hitting an artery.

2503,"> was it involuntary, like a reflex?

absolutely, was pure reflex/reaction like pulling your hand away from a hot stove.","What really sucks is that not all arteries give a super strong pulse of bright pink frothy blood, I've hit arteries that had blood that was just a few shades lighter than venous blood and with pressure the same as a vein. I've also had many spots that once were excellent veins that I was using regularly, and then one day I'll put the pin in as usual, same angle, same place and it's suddenly an artery instead of a vein. I was skeptical the first time it happened since veins & arteries are distinct, but after it had happened a couple of times when I was *certain* I was putting the needle in the exact same place, I did some googling and found that apparently when the lining of a vein is sufficiently damaged your body can re-route collapsed veins into nearby arteries, so a spot you think is a vein can suddenly turn into an artery which is a very unpleasant surprise when you're expecting an old faithful vein to deliver your hit to your brain as usual and instead feel like someone's managed to set the inside of your arm on fire."

2558,How do I know if I'm addicted? (First time posting),"Addiction and dependence are two entirely different things. Dependence is being in physical withdrawal from a substance, whereas addiction is continuing to engage in a *behavior* that continues to give you negative consequences in your life. You can be dependent without being addicted, the opposite, or both. Right now it sounds like you are neither, but you will eventually develop dependence if you keep this up another few weeks.

I started my now decade-long opioid addiction with tramadol, so be wary of it. I would stop using right now for at least a week and then resume and take it no more than every 3 days. If you can do this continually for an extended period of time;/congratulations, you are not an addict and I am envious.

2611,"Do you still get ""high""? - Q's on enhancing heroin",Just want to add that you can absolutely OD from “just” sniffing. I don’t know why people think only those who IV can OD. This is a very dangerous mindset to have and to pass on to other users.
2612,"Do you still get ""high""? - Q's on enhancing heroin","I had the opportunity to get ahold of some stuff this past weekend that is as good as any I have ever done and I have been in the game a long time. I shoot. My buddy snorts. We split a G and I reminded him a dozen times as I took him home to be extra careful. He did one line while I was with him. It couldnt have been more than a .15. He said he did a bump when he got home and thats the last thing he remembered until the paramedics revived him with Narcan. You can absolutely OD snorting. It is less common than shooting but I know two people that are now deceased that I knew personally and that I know only snorted. They still OD'd and died. So be careful. It is a harmful mindset.

As I mentioned before Ive been in the dope game a long time. 10ish years at this point. Its very rare to get ""high"" any more. That perfect dose is hard to attain. Its such a fine line to get where you want to be. Its hard/expensive to get there. Then if you are lucky enough its easy to misjudge and overdo it and wind up passed out or worse. The easiest way to get there for me is a benzo combo. And other than that I find that you absolutely must seek out the highest quality stuff. At one point I would often just take the first opportunity I had to get something as long as I knew it was decent. Just to get well or because I couldn't wait. Nowadays I will make myself wait for hours or almost a full day in order to get ahold of whoever is holding the highest quality stuff. And I'm always glad after the fact.

2706,Opiates causing lactation?,"Ok I should actually take my shitstirring hat off and put on my doctor hat and say that it’s *possible* that it can be caused by a prolactinoma which is a (usually) benign tumor (so not cancerous, just a growth) that can cause prolactin release. 

The reason I’m sceptical it’s this is because you don’t mention any common symptoms and you’re on at least one type of medication that is notorious for causing it (especially when abused). 

Other medications that can cause it are antipsychotics, drugs for hypertension, birth control pills (not likely given you’re lesbian) and medications for N+V. 

If you’re concerned, see your GP, but it sounds like a textbook case of abusing opioids and expressing milk. 

Mmm milk 🥛"
2707,Opiates causing lactation?,I have nipples Greg.  Can you milk me?
2708,Opiates causing lactation?,"Centrally active Mu opioid receptor agonists have a wide range of effects on the endocrine system which are primarily mediated through modulation and negative feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis which can manifest in clinically significant hypogonadism in the male and female of the species which can cause changes in libido, fertility, impotence in the male and so on. 

This phenomenon is different however. 

Opioids agonists exert inhibitory effects on dopamine release in the hypothalamus. Higher dopamine levels, inhibit prolactin. Lower dopamine levels cause prolactin release. Thereby if opioids lower dopamine release, then more prolactin is produced (which causes milk production). 

Therefore we can safely conclude that you are afflicted with hyperprolactinaemia which is causing galactorrhea due to the increased prolactin levels in your body, caused by opioid agonist activity in the hypothalamus, by inhibiting dopamine secretion. 

For those who may be interested, this effect can be induced by the use of the D2 antagonist, metoclopramide which is used for (among other things) nausea. Although domperidone is generally preferred as it doesn’t cross the BBB. It’s sometimes given to mothers who have difficulty producing milk, due to its properties as a galactogogue. 

If anyone is wondering, prolactin is produced all the time by the body *unless* it is suppressed by dopamine. This is why anti dopaminergic drugs, cause a surge of prolactin. It’s a negative feedback system. 

Oh also, when people ask me for advice about antiemetics for N+V and I always say I prefer 5HT3 antagonists to dopamine antagonists due to the “unpleasant side effects” the latter can cause, THIS is one of those side effects. I’m a dude. I don’t want to suffer gynecomastia or be able to be milked like a fucking dairy cow, just to avoid spewing. 

Also when people say to me “Hey Doc, nice stash of OxyContin you have there. Why don’t you take it?”  

Now you also know. 

Take care.

Oh also, when people ask me for advice about antiemetics for N+V and I always say I prefer 5HT3 antagonists to dopamine antagonists due to the “unpleasant side effects” the latter can cause, THIS is one of those side effects. I’m a dude. I don’t want to suffer gynecomastia or be able to be milked like a fucking dairy cow, just to avoid spewing. 

Also when people say to me “Hey Doc, nice stash of OxyContin you have there. Why don’t you take it?”

2710,"Centrally active Mu opioid receptor agonists have a wide range of effects on the endocrine system which are primarily mediated through modulation and negative feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis which can manifest in clinically significant hypogonadism in the male and female of the species which can cause changes in libido, fertility, impotence in the male and so on. 

This phenomenon is different however. 

Opioids agonists exert inhibitory effects on dopamine release in the hypothalamus. Higher dopamine levels, inhibit prolactin. Lower dopamine levels cause prolactin release. Thereby if opioids lower dopamine release, then more prolactin is produced (which causes milk production). 

Therefore we can safely conclude that you are afflicted with hyperprolactinaemia which is causing galactorrhea due to the increased prolactin levels in your body, caused by opioid agonist activity in the hypothalamus, by inhibiting dopamine secretion. 

For those who may be interested, this effect can be induced by the use of the D2 antagonist, metoclopramide which is used for (among other things) nausea.

2746,"And why would one add a mu antagonist to counter the receptors currently filled by the bupe? I dont get that part of what you wrote.

I might have misunderstood.

The dark side lol, niceee","Because, as I wrote (sorry that’s not meant to sound condescending) the real utility of buprenorphine as an antidepressant is due to its antagonism of the Kappa receptor. 

The fact that buprenorphine acts as a partial agonist of the Mu receptor, is in this case, undesirable because it can cause euphoria. We don’t want that because it can lead to addictive behaviour and makes you feel “high”. 

That might be desirable in an analgesic or unavoidable in opioid replacement pharmacotherapy. But it’s not something we want in an antidepressant. 

Unfortunately you can’t seperate buprenorphines Kappa antagonism and it’s Mu agonism. So, we have to block the Mu receptor by using an antagonist. However if we used naloxone or naltrexone, they don’t really discriminate between the Mu, Kappa & Delta. So if you used naloxone or naltrexone, you’d kick the bupe off the Kappa receptor (which is NOT what we want). If we did that, then the anti depressive effects wouldn’t work. 

So we want a biased antagonist that will preferentially bind to and antagonise the Mu receptor and block the euphoria. 

If we do that, we maintain the antagonism at the Kappa and retain the anti depressive response. Which is really, the whole point. While blocking the Mu receptor which gets you “high”. 

Does that make some semblance of sense?"

Agonism of the KOP induces an antinociceptive response, respiratory depression in a dose dependent manner and also dysphoria. Hence why very few pure or biased Kappa agonists are utilised in clinical practice for analgesia. 

If one combines a biased Mu receptor antagonist such as samidorphan, to counteract buprenorphines partial agonism there, one can attenuate the depressive state, while also ensuring one does not impart mild euphoria due to action at the Mu binding site, which would be an undesirable side effect in this context. 

NMDA antagonists are also finding increased utility for treatment resistant depression. 

Opioids work well for depression, but relapse often occurs upon cessation and they really only mask the symptoms and they have a plethora of undesirable physiological effects. 

Good luck.

It’s addicting, doesn’t matter if it’s subs or done.. if it tickles the receptor, it’s gonna cause habitual use. Tramadol was super effective at taking away my depression, but I’ve heard the withdrawals are nightmarish. O-dmst is a thing, but I would look up every negative before touching it. I’m sure it’s terrible long term. I’ve heard both subs and methadone taken as prescribed can be bad for your teeth long term, so they should be taken less then a month, IMO. methadone because it leeches calcium and subs because of the way they dissolve in the mouth. You could try kratom, which is relatively safe, but will backfire on you eventually and you’d have to pay the piper. Have you tried ketamine or shrooms/acid? They all have helped me a lot when I was at my worst."

Oxycodone, it really doesn’t matter. The prescribing literature says it’s fine to take with food, there is evidence absorption can be enhanced when taken with a high fat meal & some preparations are specifically designed to be crushed and mixed into food or through a feeding tube. 

Yeah gabapentin is a funny one insofar as it doesn’t really display linear absorption kinetics. The more you take, the less is absorbed. Pregabalin doesn’t exhibit this behaviour and is far more linear and predictable."

2773,"When you use an opioid while on naltrexone, do you risk the possibility of an OD when the naltrexone wears off? Is 30mg of oxy anywhere near an amount that could cause an OD?","This is actually a somewhat involved question that involves internalisation, phosphorylation & downregulation of receptors in the presence of a CNS Mu, Kappa, Delta opioid receptor antagonist and the attendant issues, the short answer is:

I wouldn’t bother. Naltrexone is pretty good at doing its thing.

Oxycodone included. Obviously you haven’t explained your dosing regimen (how much you’ve taken and for how long) so it’s difficult to give an accurate answer. 

Bear in mind that ULDN is utilised to attenuate opioid tolerance, so if you’ve been taking it chronically your receptors basically become “super sensitive” when you dump an agonist on them and you become susceptible to OD.

2988,Any other vagina owners out there suffer from this?,"I used to have that problem but I stopped having a period like..2 years ago. It's not menopause or anything..I'm waay to young for that. Apparently if you do heroin long enough, it can cause you to stop having a period. Its weird and probably not healthy. It's kinda nice  not having to deal with all the pain and feeling gross. I'm saving money not having to buy tampons too :)  which..I spend on dope lol. I wonder how common it is to not have your period after long term use. I havent asked any of the girls I know about it."
2989,Any other vagina owners out there suffer from this?,My ex female friend stopped getting her period from smoking heroin

2997,Any other vagina owners out there suffer from this?,My period was on hold for nearly 5 years during heavy iv use..have stopped h for now as its just not accessible and got my period back. And the pain is a pain is still a bloody pain
2998,Any other vagina owners out there suffer from this?,Idk why but ibuprofen still works great for my cramps. I could take a fistful of pain meds my tolerance is so high to them but they are more recreational-NSAIDS actually do work for (my) pain. Give em a try. Take 800mg (4pills) with some food and see how you feel in an hour
2999,Any other vagina owners out there suffer from this?,Ibuprofen still helps me with certain pains but I have to take a lot more of it like 1200mg + for it to have any effect
3000,Any other vagina owners out there suffer from this?,"I don’t own a ‘Giner but when I was a junky ibuprofen did absolutely nothing, the only thing that would take headaches away was a shot of dope, and the headache would be gone literally the moment it hit my brain"
3001,Any other vagina owners out there suffer from this?,Not a female but any non-opiate pain killer is equivalent to a tic-tac as far as I’m concerned on the effectiveness scale.  Of course snorting a G74 for a stubbed toe may indicate other issues....

If you don't have a tolerance i would imagine 50mgs would be nice. Be careful though because there's a chance you can develop serotonin syndrome if you're on an serotongenic drug, MOAI inhibitor, or many other drugs that target monamine release."

3081,"i took 150 and felt nothing, which means im probs way too saturated from the methadone...",Ah shit your on methadone. Nevermind man. Due to it also releasing norepinephrine you'd probably have a seizure before your opioid receptors even felt a tingle lol. I don't know how much your on. 80mg was my daily dose. I always felt a dose of opiates. Maybe it was a placebo effect from time to time idk. ROA is probably key as well. When I would IV morphine I would always get a descent rush but the nod was what was incredible for me.

3126,"what i saw was they were directly from pharmacies, with the labels and shit but i guess its safer to just go for amphetamines or something then? directly illegal stuff","Uuhhh, unless it’s pharma amphetamines like adderall then stuff like meth and even ecstasy are going to be terrible for you as they are both neurotoxic.  Adderal isn’t because it’s plain old vanilla amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, hence why it’s safe to use for ADD. It can be addictive sure but you know. 
Opiates don’t have any negative long term effects except decreased immune system/testosterone but those things are easily dealt with/treated and will reverse anyways after you detox and quit opes, though it may take some time. The real risk is impairment, say while driving, and overdose which if you’re getting legit pharma stuff is gonna be lower since it won’t be tainted and you can precisely dose it, as long as you start with low doses and only increase slowly over time. Also do your research on whatever drug your gonna do so you know everything about it you can first. 
So for which would be better? I’m not gonna recommend anyone do any drug cause that is very irresponsible of me, but if you’re going to I would go either with pharma opes like oxy/hydrocodone and morphine/codeine (nothing stronger like oxy/hydromorphone and definitely NO fentanyl), or pharma amps like adderall/vivance.

Edit: oh, and Do Not try tramadol as there is a chance for seizures. It’s really really low but there’s no reason to risk it, plus it’s like a half opiate/half SSRI and can be a Bitch to kick if you get hooked with extra bad withdrawals (and more chance for seizures)."

i take it that adderall as cognitive enhancer and opiates as mood enhancer? can i take both together? otherwise id just keep both in my stash and take opiates only when im feeling bad

i know thats a lot of questions thanks a lot for the explanation too really appreciate it","Well adderall is a specific patented combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine salts used in add treatment so it’s effects are very similar to meth except: meth is far stronger, lasts way longer, damages brain cells and has horrible side effects like paranoia and delusions. 
You could use it once no problem. You could use as much as you want however often you want as long as you’re not taking more than you can handle, it is possible to overdose but it’s not the same as something like heroin (or straight up meth for that matter). It’s pharmacologically legit, it’s not supposed to be abused but if it was like meth it wouldn’t be a medicine. (They do actually have a prescription meth but that’s a while different deal lol). 
If you have been using adderall everyday multiple times a day for a year and you come off it you are going to go through withdrawals big time, mostly psychological. It wouldn’t even take that long to become dependent. And yes your tolerance will increase and you’ll have to take more until you’re past the point your own bodies production of epinephrine/norepinephrine and serotonin is enough to satisfy your nervous systems need for those kinds of stimulation and you become dependent on the drug for that response (meaning dependence and going without meaning withdrawals). You will have to increase your dose to keep your body satisfied, the pleasure will recede cause your body doesn’t care about that and you’ll find yourself just taking the meds to keep from withdrawing, if you don’t take them you won’t be able to function. So yeah eventually increasing the dose isn’t gonna do anything as far as a high is concerned cause your body will basically be maxed out as far as that sensation is concerned. 
Adderall is a mood/cognitive enhancer and opiates are mostly mood/emotion enhancers and analgesics. You can definitely take them at the same time and it’s awesome but there are risks when you start taking high doses of each. 
Taking opiates when you are feeling depressed is the greatest feeling ever (and I mean truly depressed), but that is a sure fire way of getting hooked and destroying your life. There is no greater lure than the relief of pain and no greater pain than heartbreak. That’s a Pandora’s box that you do not want to open. 
I wouldn’t expect you to find a doctor to write scripts for cash lol, you’d have to by them from other people. If you can verify with them that they are legit then that would be best. Your probably pretty good with adderall and the like cause they aren’t faked as much, but you need to be very careful about opiates unless you are absolutely certain that they came straight from the bottle. But yeah you’ll just have to buy them the way you do any other drug."
3129,"Well adderall is a specific patented combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine salts used in add treatment so it’s effects are very similar to meth except: meth is far stronger, lasts way longer, damages brain cells and has horrible side effects like paranoia and delusions. 
You could use it once no problem. You could use as much as you want however often you want as long as you’re not taking more than you can handle, it is possible to overdose but it’s not the same as something like heroin (or straight up meth for that matter). It’s pharmacologically legit, it’s not supposed to be abused but if it was like meth it wouldn’t be a medicine. (They do actually have a prescription meth but that’s a while different deal lol). 
If you have been using adderall everyday multiple times a day for a year and you come off it you are going to go through withdrawals big time, mostly psychological. It wouldn’t even take that long to become dependent. And yes your tolerance will increase and you’ll have to take more until you’re past the point your own bodies production of epinephrine/norepinephrine and serotonin is enough to satisfy your nervous systems need for those kinds of stimulation and you become dependent on the drug for that response (meaning dependence and going without meaning withdrawals). You will have to increase your dose to keep your body satisfied, the pleasure will recede cause your body doesn’t care about that and you’ll find yourself just taking the meds to keep from withdrawing, if you don’t take them you won’t be able to function. So yeah eventually increasing the dose isn’t gonna do anything as far as a high is concerned cause your body will basically be maxed out as far as that sensation is concerned. 
Adderall is a mood/cognitive enhancer and opiates are mostly mood/emotion enhancers and analgesics. You can definitely take them at the same time and it’s awesome but there are risks when you start taking high doses of each. 
Taking opiates when you are feeling depressed is the greatest feeling ever (and I mean truly depressed), but that is a sure fire way of getting hooked and destroying your life. There is no greater lure than the relief of pain and no greater pain than heartbreak. That’s a Pandora’s box that you do not want to open. 
I wouldn’t expect you to find a doctor to write scripts for cash lol, you’d have to by them from other people. If you can verify with them that they are legit then that would be best. Your probably pretty good with adderall and the like cause they aren’t faked as much, but you need to be very careful about opiates unless you are absolutely certain that they came straight from the bottle. But yeah you’ll just have to buy them the way you do any other drug.","thanks a lot for all the info! i never knew adderall wasnt a sustainable solution, way i see it ill take it only before important exams etc (about 10 times in a year) and also once to test its effects on me ofc so that i dont screw up in my exam or even cause suspicion that im on drugs

way i see it opiates make you feel good but the next day they make you feel shit so you want to take them again? then id try them once as illegal drugs not as pills if thats possible without getting hooked, and ill keep on researching for other mood enhancers (like xtc and stimulants, weed works too)

and for daily usage ill use L-Theanine and Caffein with Ashwagandha and St. John's Wort if they work ofc (caffein in coffee really seems to work)

Anyway that's about all the info I needed to learn, thanks a lot again dude! Who knows if it wasn't for you maybe I was hooked to Adderall"

You can use it recreationally but it is addictive so you have to be very careful. People use it for academics and studying all the time, most don’t get hooked but it absolutely does happen. 
Opiates are definitely more addictive, and no they don’t make you feel shitty the next day. No hangover whatsoever, that’s part of the appeal/danger, no bad feeling :) but also no lesson the next day like with alcohol :(. I drank last night and my hangover helps keep me from doing that very often at all. The only time you feel shitty after opiates is when you’re dependent and so you feel shitty all the time in the first place unless you’re taking them, so that’s not the opes making you feel bad but rather your dependence making your default state terrible. 
I’m a little confused by what you mean by try them as illegal drugs versus pills, if you don’t have a prescription then pills are illegal too and if by ‘illegal drugs’ you mean street drugs then that would mean heroin and that’s a No No No. Absolutely try them as pills, though you will have to acquire them illegally just any other controlled substance. 
The bigger risk for dependence will always be with opiates but they are amazing so I can’t say you should never give them a try. But do do pills, H is a whole different beast."

i never knew there was such difference with oxy and h, could you elaborate maybe? are their effects the same? there isnt a better feeling than saying ive tried h so i dont wanna give up so soon"
3132,"well i assume adderall's effects are different than that of amphetamines or meth? if so, would using them just once to try hurt? or can i go more often like once a month or whatever? 

as for adderall how addictive is it, like whatd happen if i wanted to stop taking it after using for like a year also does it increase tolerance that i cant bypass with increasing my dose

i take it that adderall as cognitive enhancer and opiates as mood enhancer? can i take both together? otherwise id just keep both in my stash and take opiates only when im feeling bad

edit: i cant really find any prescriptions so buying it the way i buy illegal drugs seems to be safer than trying to find a doctor that can write fake prescriptions, i know it might not actually be from the pharmacy but ill try to find the most trusted seller, thats all i can do yes?

i know thats a lot of questions thanks a lot for the explanation too really appreciate it","I’ll respond when I get off work, I’m running deliveries like crazy lol"
3133,"I’ll respond when I get off work, I’m running deliveries like crazy lol","thanks a lot! and have fun in your work, ik thats possible with the use of some pills"

3135,"I responded to your earlier comment, sorry for the lateness lol",lol what lateness? been on weed cant tell how much time past
3136,"It’s possible to get ahold of a doctors script/pad thing and fill them out yourself but there are so many things that can go wrong there and if you do get caught You Are Fucked. Big Time felony. 
I assume you’d have to work or know someone in the business to even be able to touch one of those, better would be to have a doctor friend who just writes them for you for cash or whatever. Or work in Hollywood, those people can pretty much get whatever they want whenever they want, probably through direct doctor connections. 
So normally yeah you just have to know someone who has them and is willing to sell. You want to know For Sure that they are legit from a pharmacy and not presses though cause people counterfeit pills all the time. Best case scenario there is you get sold a sugar pill and worst case it has fent or some shit, and if you don’t have a High tolerance that shit’ll kill you quick. 
And no illegal manufacturers don’t make stuff like oxy, hydro, codeine etc. I guess they could do morphine itself cause they get it from opium, but they just turn that into heroin cause it’s more potent and they can charge more. (The super fast/awesome IV rush is also selling point). The other kinds of stuff require pretty sophisticated manufacturing equipment that only big pharmaceutical companies will have. Someone pulling a Gus Fring and manufacturing oxy out of a laundromat ain’t gonna happen lol.","Yeah the extra chemicals and time needed to produce the drug would be much more expensive than producing heroin or just synthesizing fent. Oxycodone and oxymorphone are synthesized using thebaine as the precursor. Starting at morphine wouldn't be worth it at all not to mention the yield would probably be low.

The cartel could take the discarded alkaloids and purify the thebaine. I imagine there's a synthesis for a drug that's very samiliar to oxy that's not to difficult. I still don't see the cartel ever doing this. They don't give a shit. They've already got an insanely cheap and fast method to produce an insanely powerful opioid and they could give 2 shits if people want something else. 

There are so many different opioids that will never be seen again unless you know a really skilled and dirty chemist which would cost loads of money."

And thanks to opiates (or better yet myself for abusing them), I haven’t had many sexual encounters since because of low sex drive and low motivation to be social. However as some may know I met a girl at my friends birthday party about 2 weeks ago and we’ve been talking everyday since. I really like her and it feels great to put myself out there again. She is beautiful and there’s something different about her. I thought maybe it was just me being excited but even my friends said they saw something special between us, so we’ll see. But we hung out alone for the first time last Saturday night and we planned on going out and doing stuff but she ended up just coming to my place and sleeping over, and we had a great time! And since then it’s going good, planning on going out this Saturday. So that’s what it’s looking like for me :)"
3208,Your love life?,"Also she doesn’t know I use. Should I tell her? I really wanna keep her around, but I don’t know how or if I even should tell her."
3209,Your love life?,"I’m also 19, had a long term relationship up until about 6 months ago also been doing oxy 30s almost every day for almost a year. Lately I’ve just been staying the night and hooking up with my high school buddies most recent Ex gf she’s cool and all I’m just too much of a fuck up as of late and don’t want to bring anyone down with me when the boat sinks."
3210,Your love life?,"I'm 30 years old, work in middle management in the medical field. It's a bum ass facility but I work with some good people.

My SO and I have been married for about 5 years. She knows about, tolerates, and sometimes support my use. I have a lot of demons that I need to work on with a professional but until I can afford it, I self medicate with opiates. SO is very understanding about my use and doesn't mind at all. I pay all our bills and let SO use their money for whatever they want so I can use all my disposable income for opiates. At this point I've been off 30s and stronger for about 4 -6 years and now stick to 10s or weaker with the occasional 15 to treat myself.   If I've been a real good person I'm allowed to buy a few 40s or 80s from the onion patch. No one at work knows about my extracurricular activities (lol) and I hope it stays that way. I don't really get high before work except for when I'm passing kidney stones and then all bets are off.

I work for several doctors but I'm hesitant to see them and attempt to get opiates even though they know about my issues (back pain from an old car wreck, hip pain from a congenital defect, and like I said the occasional kidney stone), I'm very hesitant to ask as I don't want to be seen as a drug seeker and am not really patient enough to milk the visits until I could get what I want. I get a little closer everyday and there's one particular doctor that it very friendly and I suspect as long as I could pass a piss test I believe she'd write me whatever I wanted eventually. 

I used quickfix fake piss to get the job so I'm not so concerned about passing the drug test I just don't want to be labeled a drug seeker, especially at the office I work in.

Any advice as to what to say or do to get a script is welcome."

3212,"Jealous of your ability to work the onion fields, I don't have the balls or the brains lol","Takes more balls than brains and not that much balls honestly. Just encrypt your address on your own, do your research on vendors and try to pay in monero and you're good.

Remember just because you receive drugs in the mail doesn't mean you asked for them. Keep a clean house and a cleaner computer and so long as you're ordering small quantities to use and not enough to sell, you're as good as gold.

Almost forgot to mention, never order international, that's a major red flag. I've even received a love letter from customs thanks to a sloppy packing job by a friend from a legal weed state and I've since spent over a thousand dollars on empire alone. Shit I feel safer ordering there than copping face to face these days."

3214,"That would be my issue cause I'm in a far out country that doesn't even have an opiate problem cause no one sells it, gotta find sympathetic doctors and that is HARD after 5 years. I'll do some research though","It can be done friend, just have to do your research and remember to protect your ass because no one else will. IMO that means, pay in monero, encrypt your address on your own hardware (not through the markets auto encrypt option), shop with vendors who have good reviews and don't order from hot countries like the Netherlands. I'm from the US and am considering ordering from Canada currently. I've never ordered internationally so I'm a bit nervous but by the end of the month when all my other plugs are tapped out, I may just roll the dice. As long as they can't prove anything on my end, the ops aren't gonna spend their precious little resources to prove I ordered 2 or three measly pills and besides, I didn't  :) this is all role play anyway right? Who would ever order drugs over the internet, if that were possible I'd say there would be thousand of packages per day that were drugs going all over ever country.

Either get you a burner Android phone that can be rooted, a burner laptop that will run some flavor of Linux or make a live bootable usb stick running TAILs and keep it somewhere where you can quickly destroy it if need be. Also never send your coin straight from an exchange to a market wallet. Always move it to a private wallet and preferably convert it to monero before spending it. Honestly though, I've bought directly from my phone, moved my coins from an exchange to a wallet and then to the market and had no problems. I've done that a few times. Not the best opsec but I'm no dealer, just a junkie trying to get my fix in the safest way possible."
3215,Your love life?,"Mrs used to enable me not anymore though, she is semi cool with it lol. She would rather I didn't but doesn't tell me off and hates seeing me sick when I try to stop. 

But she says that I should stop for our son and I agree but every morning I wake up sad/bored with a head ache and there's only one thing to stop it getting worse."
3216,Your love life?,"I’m a female in my early 30s and have been with my SO for just about 8 years. We started using together about a year in and have been on and off H (most likely fent now since it is ECP) since then. 

We are currently on subs and chipping infrequently but enough that we aren’t what anyone would call clean. We are definitely working on it and want to be off completely but it’s hard. To be completely honest, it is mostly me still pushing to use once in a while and he is a saint for putting up with my junkie ass. 

I know a lot of people (and a shit ton of examples) say it is impossible to get clean with a partner and it will ruin any relationship but I really hope we are the exception and I fully believe we love each other unconditionally at this point. We have seen each other at our lowest lows but we also don’t fuck each other over. No stealing wake up bags here haha. 

We shall see if we really break the mold but I’m optimistic at this point."

It is super nice to not have to deal with all that as we are currently on subs maintenance but we never forget the rough times and how we were there for each other.

It’s almost not worth it, the amount of time you’re going to think about getting high on your off days will consume you. Opiates are not to be fucked with, and I strongly believe that no matter who you are, eventually semi weekly use of an opiate ( depending what opiate of course) but no matter, any opiate will become physically addicting at least, wit my major psychological dependence that last for 4-6 week with PAWS included. If you are opiate naive, safe yourself the trouble of getting into it, i was a heroin addict for over 5 years shooting 1-2g a day, started with painkillers, dopesick and unable to afford pharmaceutical PKs, I switched to heroin out of desperation and never thought about a oxy or OC every again. Every one is different tho, with the right support, other hobbies/work to keep you occupied you COULD pull off chipping, but it is damn near impossible IM0, seen dozens of friends try and NOT ONE succeeded.

I'm happy to be off but they were def fun.",I doubt you two got the same batch there’s tons of people cranking out fent pills all over the country
3272,I doubt you two got the same batch there’s tons of people cranking out fent pills all over the country,"It's still straight fent homie and can be lethal to someone that doesnt know much about this. I realize the same persone doesnt supply the entire country lmao. I do know that when I went to detox I passed with no opiates. They had a special fent test and their  word for word was ""wow failed af"" lmao. A very tough detox. I still have alot of anxiety too."

3274,For sure pressed.im glad your ok and didnt do the full one!! Unless i see the script in their name i dont trust em at all,You’re telling me!! I’m just glad I woke up!! Yeah I took a chance on it but now I know to stick with my usual guy.
3275,fent laced oxy30s?,My stepfather did heroin one time and overdosed and his hearing was shot and he’s still mostly deaf till this day. And he overdosed in the early 90s
3276,fent laced oxy30s?,Man I don't wish this on nobody! Glad your safe an still alive bud.
3277,Man I don't wish this on nobody! Glad your safe an still alive bud.,Thanks!! Me too!!
3278,fent laced oxy30s?,Have you not heard of fent pills? Are you knew to doing opiates this has been a huge thing the past few years. The m boxes are the most common fakes but pretty much none are safe. There pretty common these days with some people just accepting it and doing just the fent pills since you can often get them for cheaper and there way stronger

Just always got good blues. I OD’d on a shot of fent about a year ago, so I just stopped using for a while. But I don’t remember the first few moments of my overdose so I really had nothing to compare to what fent was like compared to last night. 
I had just recently (last 2 months) found my blues plug and they’ve just been really reliable every time. They aren’t the one with the “M”, they’re the darker smaller blues. And the ones I got from California I just took a chance on. 

And yeah I don’t know anyone here that uses/and/or sells them so my options are limited!"

3298,Also did I do it correctly lol?,"Yeah, sounds like it, although the straw an inch into your nose is too deep. The drug gets into your system via the membrane in your nasal cavity so you want it to stay in your nose and not down your throat. Others have already said this but I'll repeat it, you should take them orally rather than snorting. They're stronger that way so you get more bang for your buck. Anyway, be safe homie"
3299,Did I snort correctly?,Whats the imprint on the pills..
3300,Whats the imprint on the pills..,It's Oxycodone 5mg HCL
3301,Did I snort correctly?,"Oral bioavailability for oxy is higher than snorting it. That being said, when you're snorting, put the dollar or straw a little bit into your nose (an inch seems to high up but never measured lol) and snort very gently.

Do not spit out that drip lol, go ahead and swallow it because then at least you're not wasting. Just take them orally, on an empty stomach. Than a small fatty snack 30 min later."

Usually blow my nose first, mix powder or tar with a few drops of water as little as possible(I filter it)  gently inhale in both nostrils, repeat after 15-30mins for two reasons because it takes awhile to absorb and to test the strength, I’ll be more or less aggressive after I know the strength, repeat blowing my nose about every hour after putting one or two water droplets in.

Does it taste gross and how do you smoke it?
3315,How is it smoking oxy? Does it taste gross and how do you smoke it?,"I wouldn't smoke oxy, just chew it up and swallow tbh. Some people like to smoke it bc it hits faster but it doesn't last as long. If you smoke it you gotta put a tablet on a piece of foil and gently light it from underneath until it heats up enough to start releasing smoke, inhale through a rolled up piece of foil, let the tablet run down the foil and keep chasing it with the lighter and straw. I'm sure someone can explain better bc I never fucked with smoking shit it's too wasteful if you don't know what you're doing."
3316,How is it smoking oxy? Does it taste gross and how do you smoke it?,"When I used to do oxy I would always smoke it. I liked it better, it hits harder & more quickly. Put the pill on a piece of foil (shiny side down) and put a lighter flame under it so that the very top of the flame is under the foil, just enough to heat the pill to the point that it starts sliding when the foil is angled down a little toward you. As it slides, smoke starts to come off of it, and you can use a pen barrel or something to suck up the smoke. A lot of people say smoking pills is super wasteful but I liked it. I’m a little skeptical about it making overdose any less likely though."
3317,Did I snort correctly?,"With oxy, the drip is fine bc of oral bioavailability. Keep it in, swallow it, whatever... H is a little different. Try to go like 3/4"" in and angled to the inside of your nose. Dont really a snort but just breathe in normally through that side of your nose. It needs to stay in the mucus membranes for better absorption. Aka, the less drip, the better.  Stay safe"

I was a functioning part of society, took care of my mother etc. Suffered horrible withdrawls, unbearable pain to the point I couldn't work, hell I couldn't take care of myself. Lost my job, had to go on welfare and eventually got on SSDI. About 5 yrs later my very compassionate pain dr at the time told me my only option left was pain Ms but I'd never get the dosage I need, only a fragment of it.

Incomplete cross tolerance is something clinicians account for in clinical practice when performing opioid rotations.

It’s useful in mitigating the development of tolerance and can afford a lower oMEDD.

Which is why I said by day 3 he'd be in trouble and suggested he keep taking at least a small dosage. But Subs dont really work on the ratio you're describing where the dosage is that clearly and definitively tied to the percentage of receptors covered...suboxone varies pretty widely, where 2mg is shown to have a 30 - 60% coverage and 60 - 90% at 8mg or higher. The ceiling being 16 mg for most but not all people. If subs are in your system then they bind tightly to the mu receptor and block other opiates from *fully* binding. There is always a small percentage of the receptor not covered, even in ""full"" daily doses. The trick is, if there is at least a percentage of bupe that's bound to the receptors, you shouldnt go into full precipitated wds because the bupe is already at least partially bound. That's why I suggested that he maintains at least 2mg in his system at all times and induce slowly to gradually return to full dose.

3417,Is there any actual proof that PWD is worse/more intense than regular WD?,"It’s a lot worse; I would have died from it if I didn’t go to the hospital when I did bc I had severe renal failure. In my experience, it wasn’t noticeably shorter. 

But since pwd is caused by the opiates being rapidly kicked off your receptors, rather than allowing them to metabolize normally and leave the receptors more gradually&slowly, I would think you might skip over the usual time spent leading up to full withdrawals. So instead of going through the period of like 12 hours (maybe less) where you’re not really super sick but you still don’t feel great, you just get put in full withdrawals right away, which feels even worse than if you did it regularly bc it’s so shocking to your system.

Idk, it’s not really the same as like putting all the withdrawals into a shorter time period to make it more intense but get it over with sooner, you’d just be skipping the very beginning if anything. And the physical recovery for me actually took a lot longer bc my body was so fucked up from going through such a shocking experience, I was super weak and couldn’t walk up the stairs for a month."

Curious though, cops would need a more legit reason to knock on someone's door other than just a random calling and claiming there are drugs in someone's house, right? Seems like anyone could call and claim anything if that weren't the case."

Yeah I learned that the hard way....Before then I'd not had much experience with being on the wrong side of the cops, besides having drugs on me everyday for the past 15 years, I'm pretty law abiding.

Anyway...I got arrested in a hotel room once because an ex called them on me and told them I had drugs. When they knocked, my dumbass panicked and let them in! With a pile of dope and rigs laying all over the bed no less. That is still by far the dumbest fucking thing I've ever done in my life.

3440,What happened?,"I got my ass locked up for 5 days and kicked a 2 gram a day habit cold turkey in a med unit cell alone. Almost died because they forgot about me and I had no food or water the whole time. When you're puking for days with no water, it gets dangerous. They had to take me to the ER to give me IV fluids before they could out wheel me out in front of the judge for my bail hearing.

Ended up pleading guilty, getting drug court, passing drug court and getting 2 felony counts restricted on my record, which was fucking lucky considering how much I had on me. The cops did me a solid and wrote that I had less than a gram of each. Over a gram on either and I wouldve been looking at distribution charges. Scary shit. I mean...I  guess not scary enough because I'm still in the game."
3441,Rig size for begginers ?,31 8/16 1cc
3442,Rig size for begginers ?,"Ask at the pharmacy in like a cvs or Walmart for 31 gauge, 8mm (5/16”), 1mL (1cc) insulin syringes. This is exactly what it says on the package, so it would be easy for the pharmacist to find. They come in packs of 10 or a box of 100. You can order them online too. 

A lot of people like the longer tip ones (1/2”), but esp if you’re just learning how to do it, the shorter needle would be less intimidating and easier to hold without going right through the vein."
3443,Rig size for begginers ?,Just ask for the smallest gage they have. Longest tip for beginners

3445,"H user, will I get off on a Panda?",Opana or oxymorphone is technically stronger then heroin or diamorphine so yes very much

3448,What it like getting Vivitrol?,"If you're serious about stopping and getting clean, it's a great tool. I was on it for about 4-5 months and it helped a lot. I didn't really have any side effects, and there wasn't really a bump on my ass after the shot. Like I said, if you wanna stop using, it's great. It definitely helps with cravings, but doesn't push them away completely. I was on suboxone for about 2 months, 8mg, a day, and I had ZERO cravings for dope. 

Another good option is the sublocade shot, it's basically suboxone extended release. I personally think it's the superior option. Most rehabs/detoxes really push Vivitrol, because they profit from it heavily and it does help. 

Overall I think suboxone/sublocade is the better option."

I would still recommend Sublocade though, it’s the best of both worlds betweeen Vivitrol and Suboxone.

My personal experience, I got no cravings while on subs - since it’s still a partial opiate, it tickles that receptor of my brain just enough to not have cravings. In fact, if the thought of using dope ever came up in my head it wouldn’t even “click” or trigger me, it disgusted me. I’m off subs now, and still am disgusted by heroin, such a nasty and dirty drug. And all of the fentanyl going around, people are guaranteed to die if they keep using. I know a girl who has OD 6 fucking times and just doesn’t get it. Sad shit."

They tried to talk me into Vivitrol in rehab and I said ""Fuck no... I'm not going to willingly put an opioid antagonist into my body"" as I have painful fibromyalgia and opioids help with that so I'm not going to make the best painkillers I use completely ineffective. lol xD

They talked hella shit on Methadone maintenance too and said how it's worse than Suboxone even though Methadone is a really good opioid for neuropathic and chronic pain and probably the better option in my case."

3456,What it like getting Vivitrol?,"I got put on vivitrol on Oct. 11. I've broken through on fent by snorting and also IV.... when they first inject you with the vivitrol shot it feels weird like you got hit with epinephrine or some shit.

3459,What it like getting Vivitrol?,"I haven’t gotten it, but I know plenty of people who have. Apparently is a little over $1k/ month without insurance... but your state detox might provide it for free given you go through their program. 

A lot of people that get it are surprised by the lump that forms on their butt after from the shot itself... supposedly goes away over time but I’ve heard people bitch about it more than once.

I have one friend who was allergic to it. Like it made her break out in hives and she had flu like symptoms for a while. Generally they put you on naltrexone pills for a few days before to see if you are going to react poorly to it, since they are basically injecting you with naltrexone.

In terms of cravings, I’ve heard people say it helps just KNOWING that it’s pointless to even try to get high bc it takes so much to overcome the blocking effects of opiates and alcohol."

3534,Have tried that unfortunately always end up relapsing,"I am sorry to say if that won’t work for you...a taper is unlikely to work either. A taper is similar to what jungle mentioned above.  

With having only a week I think you are better off going cold turkey. One week isn’t enough time for a taper to actually decrease the suffering of opioid withdrawals. It might actually prolong the process because your week of “tapering” you will probably be withdrawing during much of that if you are aggressive with your taper. 

In the medical field, for people who have been on opioids for a while (think a year or more), many of us taper at 10% decreased total daily dose per MONTH. If the use is shorter term, weeks or months, then sometimes the dose can be decreased by 10% per week depending on the patient tolerance to mild withdrawal symptoms. 

I would recommend going cold turkey if what was mentioned is your only option.  Have you been through w/d before?  Do you have any comfort meds or access to bupe?"

3537,300mg codeine taper?,The wd cold turkey is tolerable. In a week you’ll just be anxious and restless. You’ll feel physically better but staying off after that is an effort. If you have a week off just stop. 5 days later you’ll be feeling better. 7 days later going to work will be ok. It’s doable. Any more free time and you’ll think you can get back in it.

Using 3 to 5 days of methadone or subs to kick with no acute withdrawal symptoms only works with short-lasting opiates like heroin or oxy. It does not work with subs -- you can't use 3 to 5 days of methadone to kick subs.

>Do you mean, that 3-5 days of suboxone and then quitting, will eliminate most wds? And who’s that guy you tagged? Lmao. 

Yes. I mean that 3 to 5 days of methadone or subs at a dose that makes you feel normal -- same dose each day. 

That's it. If you do that, you will greatly reduce or even eliminate acute withdrawal symptoms.  

It won't help with PAWS, although you may not get PAWS. You'll probably be tired. But you won't have acute withdrawal symptoms  -- nausea, diarrhea, RLS, etc. It'll be pretty darn easy. 

>If that is true, I am truly happy - and thank you. This hasn’t been bad at all and I’m so happy for that. I still assume the worst is yet to come, but could the worst really be over?

This is what I am saying. 

I have used 3 to 5 days of methadone at a dose that makes me feel normal to kick heroin or oxy with greatly reduced or no acute withdrawal symptoms.

Yeah -- because you're awesome! I don't know why people dispute this because they don't understand the science -- they aren't scientists and would not get it anyway!

You're not like that and I appreciate it. 

And it's not like our understanding of science doesn't change. We think we know how something works -- then it turns out we are wrong. 

So knowing THAT this way to kick works is, for our purposes, more important than knowing how it works.

I would recommend reading her articles, both by and about her. The thing that made this book so amazing for me is it helped me understand so much more about why people become addicted. 

She sees it as a learning disorder and it makes a lot of sense. 

FWIW, I am not sure you're an addict. Addiction is defined as compulsive behavior in spite of negative consequences. 

Does that describe you?

thanks for the links, ill check em out","Just to be clear, Szalavitz is not talking about a learning disability. She is talking about a learning disorder -- 

Szalavitz says:

""Learning disorders have a couple characteristics; one is they obviously involve learning. And addiction is defined as compulsive behavior despite negative consequences. Negative consequences is synonymous with punishment. It basically means you're failing to learn from punishment. So that is a problem with learning. The other thing that happens in learning disorders, they're usually restricted to a specific sort of brain circuit.""

Szalavitz says:

""Basically, addiction is love gone awry. You fall in love with a drug or activity rather than a person. That is the basis of why I think it's a learning disorder. It happens because 90 percent of addiction starts in adolescence or your early 20s.

When you fall in love, it completely changes your priorities and you might do some irrational and not well-advised things to make sure you'll be with that partner.

What happens in addiction is that reprioritization is now aimed at a drug rather than getting a person in your life.""

Oh and this is important! Szalavitz talks about why punishment does NOT work:

""There are two things here. We just said they have no brakes, so punishing them for having no brakes isn't going to create brakes. Second, we've just said addiction is defined as compulsive behavior despite negative consequences. So if negative consequences were going to fix it, it wouldn't exist in the first place.

It's also cruel and inhumane. The horrifying thing about our addiction-treatment system is we stigmatize and do tough love and put all this pressure on people with addiction who are trying to change and who often want to stop. But then we tell them the way to stop is to go to this center where people are going to scream at you and take away the only thing that gives you any comfort and try to humiliate you.""

3630,"hmm, interesting. my thoughts-

>""Learning disorders have a couple characteristics; one is they obviously involve learning. And addiction is defined as compulsive behavior despite negative consequences. Negative consequences is synonymous with punishment. It basically means you're failing to learn from punishment. So that is a problem with learning.

i disagree. i have learned plenty from my punishments. i have learned what not to do. i have learned what happens when you do those things.i have learned a ton about drugs, addiction, and all of it. its not that i never learned it. its that what i learned didnt matter to me, because dope mattered more. i dont think theres anytihng wrong with my learning. i think theres a lot wrong with my brain, my mental illness (which in large part stems from severe trauma), and the desire to escape myself and my life. i learned how to escape, so everything else were things i still learned but just disregarded.

>""There are two things here. We just said they have no brakes, so punishing them for having no brakes isn't going to create brakes. 

it might not create brakes. but when we do things in our addictions that are ACTUALLY wrong ( i dont mean bs like getting in trouble for possession which should be legal) like hurt our families, steal, lie, etc.. we need to face consequeneces regardless if it stops us or not. 

>Second, we've just said addiction is defined as compulsive behavior despite negative consequences. So if negative consequences were going to fix it, it wouldn't exist in the first place.

but we still need those consequences. and it does stop some people. read rock bottom stories. some people take 5,10, 50 tries or times of consequences before we decide to fix ourselves. but i  never wouldve fixed myself without consequences making me do so.

ive never had this happen. i went to a suboxone doctor who was very kind and used a pharmacy that was very kind and never was humiliated. when people give this attitude to addicts (im not at all excusing this, just explaining why i think it happens often) its probably largely due to how addiction has affected their own lives. how heroin OD killed their mom. how their junkie sister stole from them. how their dinner company stole their pills from their cabinet. etc. but sometimes yea its just from ignrance and thats wrong",">It's also cruel and inhumane.

well, this goes back to the legalization issue. which i already agreed with you on - it should be a thing. and when it comes to MAT in jail... its hard to consider how to address that . because i would support it if it included the adddict getting mental health help, attending groups, doing recovery work etc - but i wouldnt support it if it was just giving out opiates to people just bc theyre dependent, at the taxpayers cost, so they dont have to be sick while serving time for a crime they committed. and again, im talking about if drugs were legalized and ppl werent sitting there on nonviolent drug crimes like personal possession. but if a drug addict is in there for stealing or a dui etc and theyre withdrawing i dont think our tax money should be going to making sure that a violent offender or serious criminal gets to be comfy while they serve their time. 

>You think they should be denied drugs like methadone to help them kick. You've said it.

no i dont. ive said that i dont think primary care doctors should be required to treat addicts coming in for relief from their acute  WDs and then given methadone. people with any other specialized health condition has to see that particular specialist to get treatment and medication. addicts should have to do the same thing as everyone else does. which would be see an addiction specialist for their methadone. which is already available, at methadone clinics that are even covered by state insurance in many states. so no, im not denying them. im just not in agreement they should get special treatment over other people. if we change teh whole healthcare system for everyone, then sure. 

>You do. But you also judge them and think they deserve to suffer withdrawal because they brought it on themselves.

thats not judging them for being an addict.  that is not even saying they necessarily ""deserve"" it. but i mean... if i walk in front of a bus and get run over, maybe i didnt deserve it but i sure had it coming and knew what i was doing. same thing with addicts who know what happens when you get dependent on dope and then stop it, but still do it. they dont deserve suffering. nobody does except like rapists aand shit. i just meant that they brought it on themselves with their choices. and that if you play stupid games you win stupid prizes. 

>Saying something like that is pointless. It isn't telling the person anything he doesn't know. And it just shames him.

that was just a random, on the spot example i made up. idk. i dont shame addicts though, wouldnt in a professional  setting. but when addicts to shameful things how can they not expect to be judged and shamed by people for it? its not my place to shame them, so i dont and like i said i never would in a professional setting and dont een do so when speaking to them casually.

>I just think you need to understand that people don't deserve to suffer -- not addicts, not pain patients, not you.

youre right. but im not saying anyone deserves some horrific type of suffering. consequences for actions that were willingly made, knowing the consequences, is not suffering. withdrawing from heroin for less than even a week, while there are options out there to prevent that already, is not suffering. having to put in the work yourself to kick without a strong opiate handed to you so you can take a shortcut, is not suffering. suffering is going through something unfairly that you didnt bring upon yourself, that is cruel and unjust, that is torturous and usually done to you by someone else, imo. people dont deserve to suffer.

and personally i do think ive deserved to suffer in some ways. ive hurt people, stolen, committed crimes, lied and betrayed and fucked up other lives with MY addiction and those actions caused ppl to suffer. i dont think its wrong for me to have to suffer due to my own addiction when ive made other people suffer due to it. but i dont think i deserve to suffer like concentration camp style or anything.

for one, i have a severe mental illness that is currently untreated due to lack of access to medical care. im also a recovering addict, and im also a pain patient that has to self medicate my MAT + pain managment in order to make it possible. so i know how it is, how hard shit can be. but i also know that some parts were a choice, and i need to be  held accountable for it. 

i judge myself and lack forgiveness toward myself way more than others. its part of my BPD. i lack a sense of self at many times. i split on myself and others. i have unpredictable up and down swings. im in a lot of pain. im depressed and anxious. these arent excuses im making for myself, just explaining the headspace that what seems to be judgement and unforgivingness here comes from. 

but i dont judge other addicts for being addicts. i do judge some of their actions - the ones that deserve judgement. but id judge anyone for those things. i forgive addicts, and myself, but i still think that even when forgiven things arent and shouldnt be forgotten. 

and i know its not all over for me. it just feels that way at many times. because of the extent to which i ruined my life. its hard to not feel that way when ive been struggling to take even one or two steps forward without being tossed back twice as many steps, and dont know how to fix myself. 

i can turn my life around. but its gonna take a lot of time and right now i lack a lot of the options that exist to some other people but unfortunately not for me right now. its hard to feel like i can turn anything around when i worry where im gonna sleep, lack healthcare so i cant see my primary doctor or go to therapy or get physical therapy or even obtain my few (3) necessary meds for MAT/pain mgmt/mental stuff without doing it illicitly and expensively. and that last part means that im often unstable due to being up and down on wrong doses of meds or sometimes completely off one or more of my meds because i cant obtain them. hard to turn around when jobs wont hire me due to an out of state bench warrant, my credit is shot, and for  those two reasons i also get denied for housing. hard when it will take 5 grand just to clear my legal shit . hard when i live in a town where work is scarce to begin with and even after applying for 30+ jobs overall in other areas my shit car might not make it to, i still cant find work. hard when i realize why ppl resort to sellin drugs.  hard when my parents are sick and aging and 800mi away. hard when im in too much pain sometimes to walk or sleep so i cant function. hard when it seems like nothing is available as a rebuilding tool. etc. 

i dont believe ill age out of addiction. because 1) ill always need pain management. and 2) my BPD is there, its severe, and substance abuse is a huge symptom that comes with that. i wish id age out of my mental illness but since i believe really severe fucked up trauma at a formative age caused it, i wont age out. id need to work my way out. and im trying, as much as i can on my own. but i lack access to professional help so only so much ican do by myself.

3650,How long were you on suboxone?,"Two years at 8mg/daily.  A lot longer than five days as you've mentioned you were on it.  I wouldn't listen to me, I really have no idea how long it takes for Suboxone to plant it's hook into ya.  People on here swear by it for short tapers to lessen withdrawals from other opiates.  

I honestly hope you don't have to experience much discomfort, if any.  I'd ask that you share your experience though later on, if you will.  If you can cut a 300mg/oxy habit with five days of Suboxone, then that is bad-ass."
3651,Day 3 of no opiates... No withdrawals?,"Man, if you magically escaped WDs, don’t question it, take the win.

But I could really do anything. It was a mental struggle really. Now if I get sick I puke, have horrible diarrhea, muscle cramps that are so painful and annoying, my eyes and nose are like faucets, I really think if I got locked up in full withdrawals it could kill me because of how much I puke. Between subs, methadone, and dope I haven’t been sick for more than a couple hours in years, but when it hits, it is unbelievable. I did not know how bad it was my first few go arounds. Fortunately maintenance drugs have allowed me to not really be sick for for than a few hours in the past 3 years. But if those ever got cut off and I had no money, idk what I would do."

3670,What dosages of methadone block the effects of opiates like heroin?,Iirc blocking doses of methadone start at like 80mg. But from my experience you can still feel dope on top of it but it'll take a good amount more than usual. I was able to get high on top of like 100mg methadone but once I was on 180mg daily there was no chance in hell of getting high on top of that.
3671,What dosages of methadone block the effects of opiates like heroin?,Methadone's blocking ability is due to the typical downregulation of the receptors due to repeated exposure not like buprenorphine's bitch ass raping the affinity space for your receptors from even one dose
3672,Methadone's blocking ability is due to the typical downregulation of the receptors due to repeated exposure not like buprenorphine's bitch ass raping the affinity space for your receptors from even one dose,Took some bupe halloween morning that sent me into prep withdrawals. That was with no methadone for a week and 24 hours after 1 point of tar. Since then on two occasions after muscling I've head my head and hands tingle and vision blurry. Though I accidentally hit a vein first time but when it happened again last night and I though I was ODing I'm pretty sure it was some kind of interaction with the bupe on my already buped up receptors from a decade of that shit. It's some evil shit.
3673,What dosages of methadone block the effects of opiates like heroin?,Doing opiates on methadone is just stupid af imo. Waste of money
3674,What dosages of methadone block the effects of opiates like heroin?,"Even on high high doses of methadone, getting high is still pretty easy, what with todays fentalouges/fent heroin being prevalent in most areas. It’s just so damn potent. 

I was on suboxone for like 14 years, and a fairly high dose of that (12 to 16mg) and I was honestly able to still get high mere hours after dosing the bupe."

3683,How to get a prescription for hydrocodone?,"Neuropathic pain is usually non responsive to opioid analgesics. There are far better options such as the TCA’s & gabapentinoids or nerve blocks and TENS.

I doubt you’ll be able to finesse a script for diffuse, non specific back pain in any event. Well maybe ibuprofen 800mg.

3723,Smoking oxy?,"Personally i think the a215, k9, m30, v's and the t189 i believe smoke the best. The t's slide whole like the original ocs do. For the other ones, my technique is as follows:

Using a more sturdy tinfoil (the thin ones suck and get burned thru easily), get a rectangle piece like 8x6 long. With the shiny side down, smooth it on a flat surface.

Take a quarter pill to start with and place in the center. I crush it using the side of a lighter. Don't press to hard until you get the hang of it or it'll tear the foil/go flying.

After its crushed, take a card or butt of the lighter and spread the powder out in a thin line lengthwise. Doesn't have to be super spread out but you also don't want it so close together.

Pick it up from the side with both hands and crease the width sides a little so you kinda make a boat shape where the powder is. Doesn't have to be drastic but just a little.

To catch the smoke i use a crisp bill not rolled up too tightly as you want a bigger hole to catch the smoke.

Lighting it and grtting the technique down requires patience and messing up. Some people cough then blow all the powder off.

That all said i don't recommend smoking pills unless you have a bunch and are cool wasting some. Since i do a lot of coke my nose gets clogged and since i don't shoot and don't like eating them, i have to smoke them to ingest.

Have fun!"

This is how I ODed on cocaine once...","I live in the UK so we get pure citric acid at needle exchanges. I considered it may be not enough citric but I'm also mindful of the amount of citric I use since it tears up your veins, and if I'm trying to get an insoluble cutting agent to dissolve then the citric acid I add won't react with anything and I'll be causing needless vein damage. I actually used powder coke for the first time in a shot last week and I was pleasantly surprised at how it instantly dissolved without me having to do anything, so much easier and hassle-free compared to using crack. It's a shame that in the UK every heroin dealer sells crack as well rather than coke and that I have to spend £80 minimum to get good cocaine whereas I can get .3 of good crack for £20."
3728,Nostril problems from sniffing oxy?,"Deviated or perforated? 

In the former, I suppose if you slipped while tooting your oxy and smacked your nose on the table or something, yeah it could happen. Are we talking septoplasty bad, who knows. 

In the case of the latter, no.

It’s not a case of “burning” it’s a case of cocaine being a potent vasoconstrictor and causing localised ischemia and anoxic injury to the cells in the nasal mucosa, thereby causing necrosis and a great big hole in your septum. Hence why cocaine is still utilised by the otolaryngology guys in surgery. It’s brilliant at stopping bleeding through the aforementioned mechanism.

Also cocaine blocks Na+ channels in cardiac myocytes and elsewhere and prevents the cell from discharging an action potential. Hence why it works as a topical anaesthetic and makes your gums, numb (hey that rhymes!).

As a bonus fact (since I’m in a hotel room alone while my wife is shopping for a fascinator to wear to the races) if you want to know why you can get a “bell ringer” when you do a large dose of sweet, sweet cocaine, it’s because cocaine causes the release of Endothelin-1 which is a potent vasoconstrictor and it ALSO inhibits the release of nitric oxide (which is a vasodilator & opposes the action of E-1). 

The spiral modiolar artery in the ear, constricts causing a loss in the supply of oxygenated blood to your cochlear. It suffers damage from low oxygen and your ears start ringing as the cells die. 

But fortunately for you, cocaine (as we all know too well) has a short duration of action & before you know it, blood flow is restored (until you do your next line or shot). The same mechanism of injury occurs with opioids at supratherapeutic doses, hence why some people OD and wake up with tinnitus. 

The more you know, eh? 

Anyway, be good."

3733,"Deviated or perforated? 

In the former, I suppose if you slipped while tooting your oxy and smacked your nose on the table or something, yeah it could happen. Are we talking septoplasty bad, who knows. 

In the case of the latter, no.

It’s not a case of “burning” it’s a case of cocaine being a potent vasoconstrictor and causing localised ischemia and anoxic injury to the cells in the nasal mucosa, thereby causing necrosis and a great big hole in your septum. Hence why cocaine is still utilised by the otolaryngology guys in surgery. It’s brilliant at stopping bleeding through the aforementioned mechanism.

Also cocaine blocks Na+ channels in cardiac myocytes and elsewhere and prevents the cell from discharging an action potential. Hence why it works as a topical anaesthetic and makes your gums, numb (hey that rhymes!).

Most commonly, when it comes to insufflated drug use, perforated septum are usually tied to acidic drugs like cocaine.  Meth is also tough on the mucus membranes of the nasal cavity and nostrils, though its long duration = infrequent dosing; cocaine's high acidity and frequent need to re-dose is why it often makes holes in ppl's noses. 

Oxycodone can make a perforated septum.  Is it likely?  Hell no.  I'm sure you could experience issues with smelling, runny nose, maybe more, from snorting too much oxy."

I find my pain is starting to creep up and become worse and worse. I am currently lying on several ice packs, and will take a hot bath to combat. Ugh, I hate being in pain.

Here I am 20 yrs later wondering what the hell happened to what was supposed to be the best years of my life. Don’t be me.
3770,Anyone else in the same boat as me ? Feel like a alien,"Wow, I rarely read long posts on reddit but I could relate so fucking much to you. I am about to turn 20 and I feel so dejected and different from everyone, I feel like I have really lost it mentally over the last few years, basically once leaving high school and not being forced to interact with people I went into extreme isolation. 

My DOC is dextroamphetamine and even though they are two different drugs the way you described your first oxy experience sounds identical to my first adderall experience, I rememeber taking a blue 10 mg IR and waiting, I got on skype with my best friend at the time and we were talking and decided to play black ops 3, I remember the exact map and where I was when I started to feel it, I felt so good I could barely talk because I was smiling and laughing so much. I finally felt ok with myself and life, I said from that moment on I want to take this the rest of my life everyday. 

Well my mental health just got worse, severe depression and social anxiety. My using got worse and worse and I started taking benzos shortly after. During this time before going to my first rehab I didn’t know about addiction and was mindlessly going through life and drugs, at 16 I was on heroin and meth and went to first rehab. I would eventually get out and get back on drugs sometimes quick sometimes it took a few months. 

My anxiety was getting much worse every time I went through this cycle of quitting amphetamine and benzos, being in rehab suicidal, and feeling worthless. In 2018 is where shit got a lot worse, I tried IV meth and got so so fucking bad on it. I went to rehab for 5 months and it was the worst experience ever, my counselor manipulated and lied to me and I was trying to process stuff there but everyone was so hostile. I stayed closed off and then my parents said they wouldn’t let me live with them and only pay for my living if I went to a halfway house. So I went there. That was the most depressing time of my life, they didn’t enforce the rules there so I sat in my apartment for 3 months straight, I would only step outside to take drug tests or to go to driveway to get my groceries being delivered. I went so far into isolation, staying up all night sleeping all day so I didn’t have to see anyone, a lot of very negative thinking, so much social anxiety that I quit smoking cigarettes and went to vaping cause I couldn’t bring myself to smoke a cig outside because someone might look at me or talk to me.

I had a plan to kill myself in February 2019 there, I was going to go buy duster at Walmart and huff it sitting on top of an overpass and huff until I blacked out then fall into traffic below. Luckily I did not do that, I came across a website that saved my life literally (https://metanoia.org/suicide/)  almost all the anti suicide websites are government ran or have nothing that I haven’t heard before or nothing that gets to me, something about this website stuck with me and it felt genuine. I revisit it when I am in dark places. 

I got out of the sober house in end of February 2019, I was staying in my own apartment and things just got worse, I used prescription adderall to keep cravings away and help depression, I got my pc into my apartment and put black bedsheets over the windows, all I did was videogame for 3 months unemployed, I was clocking 110 hours a week of ingame time. Didn’t bathe , eat, clean my apt, or go outside. I got a job in retail eventually and the misery that brought was unreal. I felt such a sense of dread every morning going to work it was physically painful. I started fucking with research chemicals at this time and fell in love with them, I was paying 80$ for the equivalent of 2000 xanax bars in RC benzos, I got to try drugs i never had access to before. And it all shipped to my apartment I didn’t have to deal with people or the illegal activities. I got really strung out on clonazolam (rc benzo). What led me into treatment was a very heavy bath salt binge and very bad delirium, 10x worse than any meth psychosis I’ve had. 

It feels so weird, my memory is so shit I do not remember most the stuff I do in a day, the 3 months I spent in sober living and the 7 months I spent in that apartment I couldn’t tell you anything I did, it is all a blur. Conversation with people feels more and more foreign, to the point where I am afraid to speak to people. I spent 20 mins having to talk myself into going over to a group of people in my current halfway house and just smoking cigs with them because my anxiety is so bad. I don’t eat much at all it feels like a chore, I never feel hungry I just feel pain eventually and have to eat something until pain goes away. I am 3 momths sober and I just isolate here and do not interact with people, I play videogames all day, I got black sheets over my windows, I basically am living the same depressing life I was before I am just sober now. I am so sexually frustrated because I know I will never be able to approach someone I like much less have sex and with them, this is sad to think but I have never had sex without being on amphetamine/meth or benzos, I don’t want to be an incel. 

I hope it isn’t like this my whole life, I want so desperately to find connection with other people but so scared. I am doing stepwork though and hoping to get some relief in that."

i think these meds - all 3 of them - are best used for MAT purposes. even if short term of just a few months. or longer, if needed. acute withdrawals can be the easiest part of quitting, its staying off thats hard not getting off.

I'm sure you're right. And I'm not saying it would be as effective as methadone or subs. But it will help.

>i think these meds - all 3 of them - are best used for MAT purposes. even if short term of just a few months. or longer, if needed. acute withdrawals can be the easiest part of quitting, its staying off thats hard not getting off. 

I disagree -- well, I think it's great if people who need to use them long term.

But I absolutely do think they should be used short term to get people off heroin or oxy, etc. They are used that way in certain rehabs and detoxes, but really -- it should be protocol and available from every doctor. 

I had a non-drug-using friend who was hospitalized for a few weeks and I went to see him the day after he got out. He told me he was scared he had caught some weird illness in the hospital because now that he was home everything smelled bad and he felt hot and cold and achey. I asked him if he had been on pain medication while in the hospital. 

Yes.

He was kicking and didn't know it.

Why not just give people like him a few days of methadone?

>acute withdrawals can be the easiest part of quitting, its staying off thats hard not getting off. 

People say that, but how many people stay high because they are scared of kicking? If it were easier, it wouldn't be such a big deal. Also, I don't think anyone should have to suffer when we have a way to ease suffering. 

Going cold turkey has never kept anyone I know clean."
3783,"IMO its harder to use kratom as a fast taper off of opiates. you have to dose it multiple times a day. it becomes harder to lower that frequency/amount and stick to it.  at that rate, why not just use your opiate of choice and taper with tht? a lot of ppl end up staying on the kratom i feel like, versus using it as a fast taper. which is fine - but still has its risks.

3784,[deleted],yeah i cant disagree with it being up there on the list of all the shitty things about kicking. it can be really bad for some ppl and lead to relapse.
3785,What's your opinion on Kratom for quitting opiates?,"It's amazing for getting off dope and IME really good for maintenance. Helps a lott with cravings and such for me, I'll still dabble with h here and there but I NEVER  shoot anymore (I can't) and I dont feel like I have to keep using, can just jump back on kratom after a few days with little pain. I really don't wanna be like how I used to be so it's mainly kratom now and short binges. 

Its not perfect sure, but it sure as hell beats spending alll my $ on dope and being in that hell of withdrawal when the $ runs dry."

People abuse methadone programs. People abuse drugs. So what? This is something that works and people should know it. People should NOT have to suffer. That's the bottom line for me.

Eh, can you prove that? Suppressing information that can reduce human suffering is not good. We should be able to make our own decisions. If clinics are suppressing this, I'm sure it's all about the money. And social control.

>People abuse methadone programs. People abuse drugs. So what? This is something that works and people should know it. People should NOT have to suffer. That's the bottom line for me.

i dont disagree. but right now look were the US is at. pain patients cant even get meds for their conditions, i cant walk into a doc and get any amount of methadone for my pain and i think that your idea is valid and should be how it is but i also think that pain patients being able to walk in and get methadone should come before addicts strolling in being handed it to them. if CP people cant even get opiates - let along strong ones like methadone - from a doctor, why should addicts be able to? right now we get cut off our opis w no taper, so its a pipe dream to think that addicts will be able to walk in and ask for opis to help them get off their drug addictions. just my opinion.

>Why would they take a few days worth of methadone if they didn't want to quit?

why do people break their own hands and go to the ER to get opiates? becuse they want to get high or unsick 

>And who cares if he's only clean for ten days and starts using again?

>At least he didn't suffer.

WHAT? who cares if someone gets clean but doesnt stay clean, as long as they didnt stuffer the one single week they were clean? isnt the goal ehere when getting clean to stay that way? so how in the world can we just say who cares what happens past their acute WD timeline - as long as they didnt suffer thru it! 

>People should not have to suffer.

people have to pay the piper. people who choose to start using drugs and who choose to shoot dope etc. should deal w the consequences of that. these people are suffering beccause they chose to suffer. i dont agree really that there needs to be a cop out available so junkkies dont have to hurt while withdrawing from the heroin they chose to use. play stupid games win stupid prizes. 

>. I am not saying this is necessarily a way to be clean forever. I'm just saying it's a way to bypass acute withdrawal symptoms. That's it.

whats the point of bypassing that if youre not gonna stay clean anyway? 

>Suffering cold turkey never kept any of us clean -- and it's not physically healthy.

no it didnt keep anyone clean, but its part of the process when you use e a drug like that. and using drugs isnt physically healthy withdrawing from them is no more unhealthy than their drug use. i dont want ppl to suffer either but its how it is. people should know that when you become a junkie youre gonna have to suffer. thats all

also, these ppl can still go to a clinic and get methadone for 3 days then stop. or they can buy subs to take for 3 days. buy kratom. etc. there are ways to get those things if they need them. 

and i get why you shared it. its just that the article loses its credibility when the author goes on, just sentences below, about how they are free at last and whatnot after one week. beating acute WD is not kicking a habit. kicking a habit means kicking it and keeping off it. otherwise we may as well just be discussing ""how to get clean for like a week and then who cares whats next lol"""

and i get why you shared it. its just that the article loses its credibility when the author goes on, just sentences below, about how they are free at last and whatnot after one week. beating acute WD is not kicking a habit. kicking a habit means kicking it and keeping off it. otherwise we may as well just be discussing ""how to get clean for like a week and then who cares whats next lol""",">because i have pain. so it would be great! methadone for 3 days, no pain, no WD, awesome! then stop and return in X days to... oh wait, i cant function. that was a tease. 

That's different. I'm so sorry. I have pain, too -- hence my not wanting anyone to suffer. 

>and because for me i am someone who needed actual maintenance in the beginning.

I am all for that! 

>i dont disagree. but right now look were the US is at. pain patients cant even get meds for their conditions,

I know. But what does that have to do with this? If anything, the idea that no one deserves to suffer would help pain patients get the meds they need.

>but i also think that pain patients being able to walk in and get methadone should come before addicts strolling in being handed it to them. 

We can and should do both at the same time. 

> if CP people cant even get opiates - let along strong ones like methadone - from a doctor, why should addicts be able to? 

Everyone should be able to. 

>right now we get cut off our opis w no taper, so its a pipe dream to think that addicts will be able to walk in and ask for opis to help them get off their drug addictions. just my opinion.

We need to work for it. Look at all the pipe dreams that have come true.

>why do people break their own hands and go to the ER to get opiates? becuse they want to get high or unsick 

Exactly! That's why they should be able to get methadone on demand. So that doesn't happen. 

>WHAT? who cares if someone gets clean but doesnt stay clean, as long as they didnt stuffer the one single week they were clean?

Yep. People should not have to suffer. And since people put off getting clean because they are scared of the kick,  it makes sense that more people would try to get clean if it weren't so scary. More people try -- we'll probably have more people succeed. And any clean time is safer than none.


> isnt the goal ehere when getting clean to stay that way? so how in the world can we just say who cares what happens past their acute WD timeline - as long as they didnt suffer thru it! 


>people have to pay the piper. people who choose to start using drugs and who choose to shoot dope etc. should deal w the consequences of that.

Why? Ask yourself that. Really ask yourself that.

Why?

People are using drugs because they are suffering. How will making them suffer more help?

What is our goal here? To make people suffer or to help them get clean?

I know what my goal is.

As for dealing with the consequences, they have!! And that is NOT a good thing. It doesn't help. So why should we make it harder when they want to start a new life?

>whats the point of bypassing that if youre not gonna stay clean anyway? 

Who cares? People get clean perhaps because they need surgery. They don't intend to stay clean, but so what? Better to have them get clean and stay healthy for surgery.

I am choosing the thing that is most likely to keep people alive.

Cold turkey doesn't make people stay clean and fear of it keeps them from getting clean. 

>but its part of the process when you use e a drug like that. 

It doesn't have to be. 

>and using drugs isnt physically healthy withdrawing from them is no more unhealthy than their drug use.

That depends and that is definitely not a reason to force people to go cold turkey.

> i dont want ppl to suffer either but its how it is.

No. I don't know what you mean by ""how it is.""

> people should know that when you become a junkie youre gonna have to suffer. thats all

People know that. And what good has that done? None. When they want to get clean -- we should do everything we can to help. Hindering it clearly has not worked. 

>also, these ppl can still go to a clinic and get methadone for 3 days then stop. or they can buy subs to take for 3 days. buy kratom. etc. there are ways to get those things if they need them. 

I know. But it should be common knowledge and legal protocol. 

As for the article losing its credibility, the fact that a junkie doesn't understand HOW something works doesn't matter. 

The fact that he knows that it works does.

We were raised in a punishment-oriented society, so I don't blame you for thinking people need to pay the Piper. We were taught that. It feels normal.

And look how it has worked -- or hasn't. 

Hell, I read something about arresting teenagers who trick or treat. Wtf?! Punish, punish, punish.

It's bullshit. 

People who are hurting and not hurting anyone other then themselves should not be punished. No one should have to suffer, certainly not people who are suffering already."

Why?

because drugs are bad. drugs ruin lives. drugs have risks. people know this. people still choose them. why shouldnt there be a consequence?

nobody is making them suffer more. most of those ppl suffering ran to drugs before they ran to try and get help for their demons or whatever. i feel for those suffering and the stuff that leads ppl to use, but *nobody else* is making them suffer more. they  are suffering because they did heroin. there are already options available that make it easier. why do we need to spoon feed addicts a totally painless way out of what they signed up for?


>What is our goal here? To make people suffer or to help them get clean?

our goal is helping people of course, but as i said..... there are options there already! there are resources to help ppl get clean. nobody is making these ppl suffer

nobody forces ppl to do this!! people can go to the resources i mentioned above. or get comfort meds. or whatever. but regardless, the addict chose to do the drugs, and if they have to go cold turkey its not because anyone is forcing them to

>People know that. And what good has that done? None. When they want to get clean -- we should do everything we can to help. Hindering it clearly has not worked.

>eople who are hurting and not hurting anyone other then themselves should not be punished. No one should have to suffer, certainly not people who are suffering already.

are you forgetting how much the majority of addicts DO hurt other people? not just themselvves. so many innocent bystanders and loved ones get hurt by addictions that arent even theirs. nobody is making addicts suffer. nobody is making them do drugs. nobody is even punishing them except the nature of their bodies. if you take a drug that causes WD, youre gonna WD. if you cant or wont utilize the handful of options already there, you cant blame other people for your suffering when you put the needle in your own arm"

It doesn't have to be the price and it is wrong that people think addicts should suffer.

Bullshit.  If people didn't demonize addicts, they couldn't use that excuse.

From a doctor's office. Three to five days worth. 

>youre acting like methadone clinics and suboxone clinics and kratom dont exist. 

No, I'm not. I'm saying we can do more. Do you know when France made it legal for any doctor to prescribe suboxone, overdose rates fell by 79% -- yes, 79%!! -- in just four years? We need to do that. 

But we don't. And part of that is because people think addicts should suffer. And worse.

Ah! That's the War on Drugs propaganda. I don't blame you for thinking it. It seems normal. We were raised on it.

But people used to say the same thing about masturbation. About homosexuality.  The exact same things you just listed.

Alcohol and tobacco are bad. They ruin lives. They have risks. People still choose them.

But there is no consequence like the ones drugs users face. No jail or prison or utter contempt, the idea that they deserve bad things. None of that.

But that idea exists for drug users, as it used to for homosexuals.

Question it. QUESTION IT! We were all brainwashed by propaganda. 

>most of those ppl suffering ran to drugs before they ran to try and get help for their demons or whatever. 

So? That doesn't mean they have to suffer more. And it's not like it's easy to find help.

We are, when we think they deserve to suffer. 

> they are suffering because they did heroin.

That's not the only reason. Heck, if heroin were legal, like in Switzerland or the UK (the British System), they wouldn't suffer from doing heroin.

Why not? We want fewer addicts, right? And why use terms like ""spoon feed."" It's just help for people who need it.

>why should we make it easy peasy on people who ruined their own lives?

Because building a new life is hard, but that is what we want. Fewer addicts. Better lives for everyone. Do you know addiction rate goes down when heroin is legalized?

>are you forgetting how much the majority of addicts DO hurt other people? 

Legalize it and watch that change. Again, I refer to the article about the British System. 

What is better for families? And addict in prison or an addict in something like the British System or like what they do in Switzerland?

And what is better -- a parent kicking for a week or a parent able to take care of work, the house, the kids?

If you really want things to be better, you need to accept that all this punishment, all this War on Drugs crap, does NOT WORK. Not for anyone. 

We need to stop demonizing, stop dehumanizing, start helping. You say there is plenty of help, but there isn't. What there is is expensive or has waiting lists or is ineffective.  And shame and fear prevent people from asking for help.

We need to make changes and more punishment is not the answer."

Again with the ""punish."" We need to get rid of that idea. If it is not okay to punish drug addicts, then it sure as hell won't be ok to punish pain patients.


of course i know theyre the excuse mostly. but in some ways they are part of the cause. people using pill mills without needing them just to get the drugs, just as guilty as the doctors prescribing. people who go in faking pain to get opiates because they are sick or whatever, make it harder for people with real pain to be believed. otherwise i agree tho

and im not saying we should ""punish"" addicts. im just saying there are already options available for them to use to get off drugs. if they cant/wont, then they are punishing themselvs and theyre punishing themselves going through WD in the first place because they knew what heroin does. nobody else is punishing them by making them have acute WD. just their own body, which they willingly put drugs into. 


>Of course they are. Hell, they get incarcerated. Jail. Prison. For nothing more than being addicts. Part of that whole punishment crap.

oh of course i agree here. i just didnt think thats what we were discussing. i thought we were just talking about WD. trust me i agree on this, and personally can relate to this one sadly

>It doesn't have to be the price and it is wrong that people think addicts should suffer.

>That's how they justify pain patients suffering.

the only suffering i meant was valid and is paying the piper is going thru WD if you do drugs. thats all, nnot the other suffering like legal issues etc. why shouldnt WD be the price, i mean they chose to abuse these drugs that cause WD. they made themselves suffer as far as WD goes. 

pain patients are an entirely diff story. pain patients are suffering not because we should pay the price for having pain and needing the medicine that was designed for pain - not getting high. i dont think these two points are related personally

>From a doctor's office. Three to five days worth.

there are places that cater to this though. why should GP's have to do this, too? addiction docs treat addiction. not GP's. 

and related question - should there be a 1 time limit on this if they did use this policy? or if that addict keeps failing should they be able to keep goin to doc for these methadone scripts? 

i also just cant help but view this from a personal angle, maybe biased maybe not idk... but a drug addict comes in withdrawing and wnats to skip acute WD, doc should give them 3-5days methadone. pain patient comes in barely functional, sent out with naproxen or some bullshit and told that we cant get opiates unless we have cancer. but addicts can have strong ass opiates. thats like a wtf thing to me

>No, I'm not. I'm saying we can do more. Do you know when France made it legal for any doctor to prescribe suboxone, overdose rates fell by 79% -- yes, 79%!! -- in just four years? We need to do that.

i agree. wouldve saved me grief when i asked my gp for it

>But we don't. And part of that is because people think addicts should suffer. And worse.

maybe a bit of yes and no. there are plenty of suboxone doctors. plenty of methadone clinics. kratom. whatever. addiction treatment is a specialist type thing - just like pain management is. i dont see the problem with addicts having to go to addiction specialists when people with other specialized issues have to go to specialists, too. 

>Ah! That's the War on Drugs propaganda. I don't blame you for thinking it. It seems normal. We were raised on it.

i think it because its true. and because ive lived it. its normal to think heroin addiction ruins lives because it fucking does, not because propaganda

>But people used to say the same thing about masturbation. About homosexuality. The exact same things you just listed.

addiction is not comparable at all to these things. masturbation and homosexuality actually dont hurt others. drug addiction often ends up doing so, though. 

>So? That doesn't mean they have to suffer more. And it's not like it's easy to find help.

and going thru acute WD is not making them suffer more. it isnt always easy to find help your right, but many of  thesee people never even try. they self medicate their issues with drugs not meant to and then blame everyone  else for how they  suffer


i agree with legalization. i never disagreed with it. but right now its not legal here, so i was speaking based on how it is here. not how it should be. and i also was refering almost entirely to acute WD because thats the comment i was ressponding to. didnt know you were including legaliztion and whatnot in your points. i agreee with those. 

>And what is better -- a parent kicking for a week or a parent able to take care of work, the house, the kids?

a parent shouldnt be parenting when they have a drug addiction bad enough to make them that sick. blame the parent for the fact that they are sick, not the system

i agree on this. wasnt ever disagreeing. i support legalization but i dont see it happening, so i am speaking based on current legislation and whatnot. 

i guess i just have a lot of opinions leaning toward fixing the pain managment issue in this country before fixing the addiction issue. but thats a personal thing. i wasnt an addict until the way pain patients turned us into addicts and criminals. so im gonna fight for easy access to things like methadone from a doctor for pain before i fight for access to it for addicts who just want to beat their withdrawals. nobody gives a fuck when pain patients withdraw on top of their pain, or offers us a 5 day methadone script, or any help. 

i support all help for addicts and want to go into that industry actually, however i just really disagree with the attitude i see sometimes here that make it seem like addicts are suffering and its someone elses fault, they deserve opiates to get high meanwhile ppl in pain cant get them for real reasons, and the disregard for the choices addicts make and bring upon themselves but are unwilling to take any responsibility for."
3811,">C'mon. If I know one thing about you it's that you are smart. Drug addicts are just the excuse. The fall guy. They're not the real reason.

Again with the ""punish."" We need to get rid of that idea. If it is not okay to punish drug addicts, then it sure as hell won't be ok to punish pain patients.


of course i know theyre the excuse mostly. but in some ways they are part of the cause. people using pill mills without needing them just to get the drugs, just as guilty as the doctors prescribing. people who go in faking pain to get opiates because they are sick or whatever, make it harder for people with real pain to be believed. otherwise i agree tho

and im not saying we should ""punish"" addicts. im just saying there are already options available for them to use to get off drugs. if they cant/wont, then they are punishing themselvs and theyre punishing themselves going through WD in the first place because they knew what heroin does. nobody else is punishing them by making them have acute WD. just their own body, which they willingly put drugs into. 


>Of course they are. Hell, they get incarcerated. Jail. Prison. For nothing more than being addicts. Part of that whole punishment crap.

oh of course i agree here. i just didnt think thats what we were discussing. i thought we were just talking about WD. trust me i agree on this, and personally can relate to this one sadly

>It doesn't have to be the price and it is wrong that people think addicts should suffer.

>That's how they justify pain patients suffering.

the only suffering i meant was valid and is paying the piper is going thru WD if you do drugs. thats all, nnot the other suffering like legal issues etc. why shouldnt WD be the price, i mean they chose to abuse these drugs that cause WD. they made themselves suffer as far as WD goes. 

pain patients are an entirely diff story. pain patients are suffering not because we should pay the price for having pain and needing the medicine that was designed for pain - not getting high. i dont think these two points are related personally

>From a doctor's office. Three to five days worth.

there are places that cater to this though. why should GP's have to do this, too? addiction docs treat addiction. not GP's. 

and related question - should there be a 1 time limit on this if they did use this policy? or if that addict keeps failing should they be able to keep goin to doc for these methadone scripts? 

i also just cant help but view this from a personal angle, maybe biased maybe not idk... but a drug addict comes in withdrawing and wnats to skip acute WD, doc should give them 3-5days methadone. pain patient comes in barely functional, sent out with naproxen or some bullshit and told that we cant get opiates unless we have cancer. but addicts can have strong ass opiates. thats like a wtf thing to me

>No, I'm not. I'm saying we can do more. Do you know when France made it legal for any doctor to prescribe suboxone, overdose rates fell by 79% -- yes, 79%!! -- in just four years? We need to do that.

i agree. wouldve saved me grief when i asked my gp for it

>But we don't. And part of that is because people think addicts should suffer. And worse.

maybe a bit of yes and no. there are plenty of suboxone doctors. plenty of methadone clinics. kratom. whatever. addiction treatment is a specialist type thing - just like pain management is. i dont see the problem with addicts having to go to addiction specialists when people with other specialized issues have to go to specialists, too. 

>Ah! That's the War on Drugs propaganda. I don't blame you for thinking it. It seems normal. We were raised on it.

i think it because its true. and because ive lived it. its normal to think heroin addiction ruins lives because it fucking does, not because propaganda

>But people used to say the same thing about masturbation. About homosexuality. The exact same things you just listed.

addiction is not comparable at all to these things. masturbation and homosexuality actually dont hurt others. drug addiction often ends up doing so, though. 

>So? That doesn't mean they have to suffer more. And it's not like it's easy to find help.

and going thru acute WD is not making them suffer more. it isnt always easy to find help your right, but many of  thesee people never even try. they self medicate their issues with drugs not meant to and then blame everyone  else for how they  suffer


i agree with legalization. i never disagreed with it. but right now its not legal here, so i was speaking based on how it is here. not how it should be. and i also was refering almost entirely to acute WD because thats the comment i was ressponding to. didnt know you were including legaliztion and whatnot in your points. i agreee with those. 

>And what is better -- a parent kicking for a week or a parent able to take care of work, the house, the kids?

a parent shouldnt be parenting when they have a drug addiction bad enough to make them that sick. blame the parent for the fact that they are sick, not the system

>We need to stop demonizing, stop dehumanizing, start helping. You say there is plenty of help, but there isn't. What there is is expensive or has waiting lists or is ineffective. And shame and fear prevent people from asking for help.

This all should be LEGAL. We don't have an opioid crisis. We have a Prohibition crisis. 



There are very few options for addicts to get off drugs and what we have often doesn't work. NA, rehabs have a 90% fail rate.

And addicts who can't or won't get off of drugs do not deserve to suffer through withdrawal when they decide to get clean.

Suffering doesn't help.

Letting them suffer is punishing them. 

>the only suffering i meant was valid and is paying the piper is going thru WD if you do drugs

No. There is absolutely no reason for it. None. It doesn't do any good. 

>pain patients are an entirely diff story. pain patients are suffering not because we should pay the price for having pain and needing the medicine that was designed for pain - not getting high. i dont think these two points are related personally

Again -- you think addicts deserve punishment. 

For what?

Start questioning that idea. Really. As I already said, I don't blame you for having it. We have all been brainwashed by the War on Drugs. 

But question it. Remember there are people who think AIDS is God's punishment on homosexuals and that they should suffer. I'm sure you know what bullshit that is. It's bullshit when it comes to drug addicts, too.

>there are places that cater to this though. why should GP's have to do this, too? addiction docs treat addiction. not GP's. 

Remember when I said before that France was having a huge overdose crisis, so they made it so all doctors could prescribe suboxone, not just certain doctors? And the death rate from overdose fell 79% in just four years?

That's why. 

>and related question - should there be a 1 time limit on this if they did use this policy? or if that addict keeps failing should they be able to keep goin to doc for these methadone scripts? 

No time limit. It takes as long as it takes. Remember  -- we want to keep people alive. We want to help people stop being addicted. We don't want people to suffer. And punishment is counterproductive and pointless.

I know it's hard to get out of that mindset  -- that we should punish and control, that it's right to do so -- but it's not right. It doesn't help.

>i also just cant help but view this from a personal angle, maybe biased maybe not idk... but a drug addict comes in withdrawing and wnats to skip acute WD, doc should give them 3-5days methadone. pain patient comes in barely functional, sent out with naproxen or some bullshit and told that we cant get opiates unless we have cancer. but addicts can have strong ass opiates. thats like a wtf thing to me

Ih, both people should get exactly what they need. The addict should get methadone and the pain patient should get oxy or whatever. 

And don't you see that if we saw addicts differently, there would be no way to use addiction as an excuse to deny opioid painkillers to pain patients? 

>addiction treatment is a specialist type thing 

Again -- France. And a doctor giving methadone to a patient does not prevent that patient from seeking additional treatment, if he needs it. He may not. 

>i think it because its true. and because ive lived it. its normal to think heroin addiction ruins lives because it fucking does, not because propaganda

Did you read the link about the British System? When heroin was prescribed by doctors, lives were NOT ruined. Same thing in Switzerland. Oddly enough, addiction rates when down. Some people prescribed heroin actually stop using and whether they did or not -- their lives got better. They weren't ruined.

>addiction is not comparable at all to these things. masturbation and homosexuality actually dont hurt others. drug addiction often ends up doing so, though. 

But it is -- people felt the same way and said the same things about masturbation and homosexuality as they do about addiction. 

Heck, people got locked up for homosexuality. It was a crime. It ruined lives -- but it wasn't the homosexuality that ruined lives. It was societal attitudes and laws.

>and going thru acute WD is not making them suffer more. it isnt always easy to find help your right, but many of thesee people never even try. they self medicate their issues with drugs not meant to and then blame everyone else for how they suffer

Yes, it is making them suffer more. Making people suffer when they don't have to is, well, making them suffer.

If these people want to get clean, they ARE trying. So help them!

If they're self medicating  -- give them better medicine!

Don't say they deserve to suffer. Don't let them suffer. What good will that do?

>a parent shouldnt be parenting when they have a drug addiction bad enough to make them that sick. blame the parent for the fact that they are sick, not the system

So why are you standing in the way of making it easier for the parent to get clean?

>i guess i just have a lot of opinions leaning toward fixing the pain managment issue in this country before fixing the addiction issue. 

Why not do both at the same time?

>but thats a personal thing. i wasnt an addict until the way pain patients turned us into addicts and criminals.

Addiction is defined as compulsive behavior in spite of negative consequences. If you're not doing that, you're not an addict. 

> so im gonna fight for easy access to things like methadone from a doctor for pain before i fight for access to it for addicts who just want to beat their withdrawals. 

Why not fight for it for both?

>nobody gives a fuck when pain patients withdraw on top of their pain, or offers us a 5 day methadone script, or any help. 

Nobody gives a fuck when addicts do either. No one offers them 5 days of methadone, either. 


>i support all help for addicts and want to go into that industry actually, 

I really like you. You are a good person, a smart person, but I don't think you should go into the addiction field until you realize addicts are not the ""other,"" until you understand that they do not deserve to suffer, until you understand that suffering and punishment won't help. 

When you understand that  -- you'll be AMAZING!



>however i just really disagree with the attitude i see sometimes here that make it seem like addicts are suffering and its someone elses fault, 

Who have I blamed? Everyone is suffering and no one should. 

>they deserve opiates to get high meanwhile ppl in pain cant get them for real reasons,

All reasons are real. And absolutely no one thinks addicts deserve opiates. They think addicts deserve to suffer. Heck, you think that, good as you are, yet you still think it.

> and the disregard for the choices addicts make and bring upon themselves but are unwilling to take any responsibility for.

Again, until you let go of this attitude of blame and punishment and judgment when it comes to addicts, don't go into the field of addiction.  I believe in you. I know you are smart and have a good heart. I don't blame you for being brainwashed at all. I was, too, once upon a time. 

I have every faith your natural intelligence and goodness will lead you to see that these attitudes about punishment and blame are wrong, are counterproductive.

Depends on their insurance coverage either thru job, parents if they're under 26, or if their state offer state ins thru medicaid or not. Only 19 (ithink that's number) states don't have medicaid extended. Thats still not a good % but it's less than half at least. 

Otherwise, there aren't very few options. There's rehabs. IOP. Methadone clinics. Suboxone clinics. SMART meetings if you aren't into NA.

>And addicts who can't or won't get off of drugs do not deserve to suffer through withdrawal when they decide to get clean.

Why not? They knowingly did drugs that have WD symptoms. They don't *deserve* It maybe but they shouldn't expect a magic exemption 

>Suffering doesn't help.

It doesn't. But if you make bad choices you suffer. 

>Letting them suffer is punishing them. 

How so? They put the drugs in their body. Why is it someone else's job to rescue ppl from their own self destruction. Who is punishing them? Who is making them suffer? Why are others being blamed for addicts suffering when the addicts are the ones doing drugs that have sufferable consequences? 

>No. There is absolutely no reason for it. None. It doesn't do any good. 

Not everything in the world does good. The reason people suffer from WD is because they do drugs that cause it. But God forbid we ever blame the addict lol

>

>For what?

What punishment am i implying th3y deserrve ? The punishment of WD for the drugs they put in their own body. 

>Remember there are people who think AIDS is God's punishment on homosexuals and that they should suffer.

Those ppl are ignorant. AIDS happens when anyone, homosexual or not, engage in unsafe sex or needle sharing. 

>No time limit. It takes as long as it takes.

So they can go every 2 weeks and get methadone handed to them and maybe use it right or maybe get clean, that's ok? I hope you at least dont expect someone else to pay for those visits lol

>Remember -- we want to keep people alive

>We don't want people to suffer.

So why are people in pain getting Tylenol while recreational users apparently should get methadone? If we're gonna help addicts we need to help the ppl that the system turned into addicts, or arent but have their lives fucked up due to lack of meds, too 

>Ih, both people should get exactly what they need. The addict should get methadone and the pain patient should get oxy or whatever. 

Why does tje addict get better meds than someone in real physical pain lol? Just because they like to get high they deserve a better script or?

>But it is -- people felt the same way and said the same things about masturbation and homosexuality as they do about addiction. 

Just bc ppl said it doesnt mean it's true. It's a fact that addicts harm other more than gays and people that jerk off. 

>Yes, it is making them suffer more. Making people suffer when they don't have to is, well, making them suffer.

But WHY shouldn't ppl have to suffer for bad choices they knowingly made? Who is forcing them to suffer ? Nobody makes them us dope. Nobody makes them not seek other treatment. Acute WD is nothing in terms of suffering compared to what many addicts do to make their loved ones suffer. If they can't handle a few days of sickness they cant blame anyone else when they are the ones making these choices.  

>If these people want to get clean, they ARE trying. So help them!

There IS help. But when you use heroin physical detox is just a result of it and if they wanna get clean they can put in the effort to get thru that and shouldt expect someone to help them skip withdrawal. That's just nuts. Its like taking all blame off addicts as if they are the victim for having withdrawal they brought on themselves..

>If they're self medicating -- give them better medicine!

Who? Opiates are better medicine ror for opiate addiction ? No, imo. If theyre self medicating they need mental help not strong shit like methadone 5o drown out their issues 

> Don't let them suffer. What good will that do?

They let themselves suffer.  Why is it other ppls responsibly to make sure ppl sticking needles in their arms don't suffer ? It does no good , but again - why are we not blaming thr addict at all??

>So why are you standing in the way of making it easier for the parent to get clean?


I'm personally not at all. I'm not the one refusing ppl help. I'm in no one's way

>Why not do both at the same time?

We should. 

>Addiction is defined as compulsive behavior in spite of negative consequences. If you're not doing that, you're not an addict. 

Yeah, I was. I'm recovering now 

>Nobody gives a fuck when addicts do either. No one offers them 5 days of methadone, either. 

Addicts can go to clinics for help. Its not like they don't exist. Pain patients can't go to pain clinics and get nearly any opiates. 

Also, idt it's comparable. Most pain patients didnt choose their pain. I didn't choose for a car to run me over. Addicts aren't victims to ther addictions tho. Nobody ran them over with a needle and made them a junkie. I agree we should help both. But I don't think the groups compare. Addicts shouldn't be getting stronger scripts than ppl in pain, there are more maintnance and addiction treatment options available now thn pain mgmt treatments. 

And im going into tje field to counsel. Not to hand out meds to people. I think addicts need consequences for their choices and to be held accountable. Id be a shitty counselor if i coddled them and told them they're the victim and should suffer none for any of what they've done etc. 

If you get addicted to a drug u jnow will make u WD, then expect to WD unless you go to a clinic. If you steal or commit crimes in you4 addiction, expect to suffer the consequences. If you choose to self medicate and not seek mental help in any way, you shouldn't expect a free pass when you aren't happy with your 5 days of acute WD. Etc. I think ppl should deal w consequences for what they've done is all. Nobody Is punishing them for addiction alone (unless legal issues), and WD is punishment from your body for putting drugs in it. Nobody is responsible for that but the user. 

>When you understand that -- you'll be AMAZING

Thank you though. Although like I said I plan to counsel. Give HR info and resources. I help ppl with Suboxone, tapering etc. I answer questions for safe use. I help support ppl getting clean if they put in the work. But I'm just not gonna tell ppl that their suffering isnt fair if they caused it. That doesn't help. That breeds lack of accountability and responsibility etc.

>veryone is suffering and no one should. 

Why shouldn't ppl suffer for poor choices? How would anyone ever learn?

>They think addicts deserve to suffer. 

I dont. I just think that withdrawal comes with use. If that's unfair suffering then I guess the worlr has no consequences

>Again, until you let go of this attitude of blame and punishment and judgment when it comes to addicts, don't go into the field of addiction. 


I'm not blaming addicts for anything except their poor choices. I blame myself for mine too. I only brought up blame bc you made it sound like someone else in the world is to blame for addicts suffering. I don't want to punish anyone. I don't judge addicts. I am one. But some of our actions SHOULD be judged. We do awful shit often. It isn't excusable. I include myself tho and don't judge anyone for being an addict. 

Anyway thanks for the compliments tho!!"

>But it is -- people felt the same way and said the same things about masturbation and homosexuality as they do about addiction. 

Just bc ppl said it doesnt mean it's true. It's a fact that addicts harm other more than gays and people that jerk off. 

>Yes, it is making them suffer more. Making people suffer when they don't have to is, well, making them suffer.

But WHY shouldn't ppl have to suffer for bad choices they knowingly made? Who is forcing them to suffer ? Nobody makes them us dope. Nobody makes them not seek other treatment. Acute WD is nothing in terms of suffering compared to what many addicts do to make their loved ones suffer. If they can't handle a few days of sickness they cant blame anyone else when they are the ones making these choices.  

>If these people want to get clean, they ARE trying. So help them!

There IS help. But when you use heroin physical detox is just a result of it and if they wanna get clean they can put in the effort to get thru that and shouldt expect someone to help them skip withdrawal. That's just nuts. Its like taking all blame off addicts as if they are the victim for having withdrawal they brought on themselves..

>If they're self medicating -- give them better medicine!

Who? Opiates are better medicine ror for opiate addiction ? No, imo. If theyre self medicating they need mental help not strong shit like methadone 5o drown out their issues 

> Don't let them suffer. What good will that do?

They let themselves suffer.  Why is it other ppls responsibly to make sure ppl sticking needles in their arms don't suffer ? It does no good , but again - why are we not blaming thr addict at all??

>So why are you standing in the way of making it easier for the parent to get clean?


I'm personally not at all. I'm not the one refusing ppl help. I'm in no one's way

>Why not do both at the same time?

We should. 

>Addiction is defined as compulsive behavior in spite of negative consequences. If you're not doing that, you're not an addict. 

Yeah, I was. I'm recovering now 

>Nobody gives a fuck when addicts do either. No one offers them 5 days of methadone, either. 

Addicts can go to clinics for help. Its not like they don't exist. Pain patients can't go to pain clinics and get nearly any opiates. 

Also, idt it's comparable. Most pain patients didnt choose their pain. I didn't choose for a car to run me over. Addicts aren't victims to ther addictions tho. Nobody ran them over with a needle and made them a junkie. I agree we should help both. But I don't think the groups compare. Addicts shouldn't be getting stronger scripts than ppl in pain, there are more maintnance and addiction treatment options available now thn pain mgmt treatments. 

And im going into tje field to counsel. Not to hand out meds to people. I think addicts need consequences for their choices and to be held accountable. Id be a shitty counselor if i coddled them and told them they're the victim and should suffer none for any of what they've done etc. 

If you get addicted to a drug u jnow will make u WD, then expect to WD unless you go to a clinic. If you steal or commit crimes in you4 addiction, expect to suffer the consequences. If you choose to self medicate and not seek mental help in any way, you shouldn't expect a free pass when you aren't happy with your 5 days of acute WD. Etc. I think ppl should deal w consequences for what they've done is all. Nobody Is punishing them for addiction alone (unless legal issues), and WD is punishment from your body for putting drugs in it. Nobody is responsible for that but the user. 

>When you understand that -- you'll be AMAZING

Thank you though. Although like I said I plan to counsel. Give HR info and resources. I help ppl with Suboxone, tapering etc. I answer questions for safe use. I help support ppl getting clean if they put in the work. But I'm just not gonna tell ppl that their suffering isnt fair if they caused it. That doesn't help. That breeds lack of accountability and responsibility etc.

>veryone is suffering and no one should. 

Why shouldn't ppl suffer for poor choices? How would anyone ever learn?

>They think addicts deserve to suffer. 

I dont. I just think that withdrawal comes with use. If that's unfair suffering then I guess the worlr has no consequences

>Again, until you let go of this attitude of blame and punishment and judgment when it comes to addicts, don't go into the field of addiction. 


I'm not blaming addicts for anything except their poor choices. I blame myself for mine too. I only brought up blame bc you made it sound like someone else in the world is to blame for addicts suffering. I don't want to punish anyone. I don't judge addicts. I am one. But some of our actions SHOULD be judged. We do awful shit often. It isn't excusable. I include myself tho and don't judge anyone for being an addict. 

Anyway thanks for the compliments tho!!","

>Otherwise, there aren't very few options. There's rehabs. IOP. Methadone clinics. Suboxone clinics. SMART meetings if you aren't into NA. 

Let me clarify -- there are few effective  options for addicts.  Rehabs -- all rehabs -- have a 90% fail rate.  So does NA.

MAT is your best bet, but still -- it reduces mortality by 50% in recovering addicts, but we as a society need better. 


>Why not? They knowingly did drugs that have WD symptoms. They don't deserve It maybe but they shouldn't expect a magic exemption 

We ALL do things we know have bad consequences. Should we beat a kid who falls off a jungle gym we told him not to climb? If a person is skydiving and has an accident, do we not bring them to the hospital?

Look -- if people truly believed no one deserved to suffer -- addict or not -- that would HELP pain patients, not hurt them. 

>Not everything in the world does good.
If you want the world to be good to you -- be good to others. If you don't want the world to dismiss or ignore your pain, make a world where doing that to anyone is unthinkable. 


>The reason people suffer from WD is because they do drugs that cause it. But God forbid we ever blame the addict lo

What good will blaming addicts do them or you? Has this attitude helped pain patients AT ALL? No. In fact,  it's hurt them. It's used against them.

>Those ppl are ignorant. AIDS happens when anyone, homosexual or not, engage in unsafe sex or needle sharing. 

Just like withdrawal happens to addicts and pain patients alike.

>So they can go every 2 weeks and get methadone handed to them and maybe use it right or maybe get clean, that's ok? I hope you at least dont expect someone else to pay for those visits lol

Why do you think they would? I am curious about that. And since less that 2% of Americans have even tried heroin, much less become addicted, I have no problem paying for this as part of universal healthcare. 

>So why are people in pain getting Tylenol while recreational users apparently should get methadone?

Again, if our society embraced the idea that no one should suffer, pain patients would get opiate pain medication. 

Recreational users DON'T get methadone, btw. That's a problem. If they did, if it weren't a problem, if it were done in a doctor's office, what would be the problem with giving opiates to pain patients?

There'd be no problem. 

> If we're gonna help addicts we need to help the ppl that the system turned into addicts, or arent but have their lives fucked up due to lack of meds, too 

I keep saying this. Over and over. It's like you don't hear it.

If NO ONE deserves to suffer -- then no one deserves to suffer. And if addicts don't deserve to suffer, then obviously pain patients don't. 

You ever been treated like an addict? Did you like it? You seem to think the answer is to make a division between pain patients and addicts.  How's that working out?

My answer is to make it unthinkable for ANYONE to suffer. If it's not okay to treat addicts like shit, then it's not okay to treat anyone like shit.

I keep saying the same thing to you. Just try to consider it."

3913,Closed Eye visuals on H?,i've experienced some serious closed eye visuals while being fucked up on H. i've also done a similar combo to what you're talking about. only difference was i was much more opiate naive so it was just tussionex at the time. but man i felt trippy as fuck. it was awesome though. i loved it. i hate to say it by mixing drugs that aren't usually mixed can be fun as fuck. albeit stupid as hell unless you have a tolerance to said drugs.
3914,Closed Eye visuals on H?,"The very first time I tryed H, when I was like 15, thought I was hardcore! 😂 Smoked half a £20 bag and every time I closed my eyes I saw loads of skulls and crossbones with triangles around them, flashing like a disco, flying through my eyes(coming at me and going right through). Then I puked like a motherfucker and felt as if I hadn't smoked anything.

Never had anything like that happen since though and I'm 35 now, been on and off that shit more times than I'd like to acknowledge!"
3915,Closed Eye visuals on H?,Everytime I mixed H and Xanax in big doses. Yeah I know its not good and I already ODed cause of it and dont do it anymore these days. So when mixing 6-10mg Xan and .5-.8 of H and I nod I get visuals too. Like closing my eyes and dreaming.

Kratom is great for this - but remember it’s addictive as well. If I were in your shoes I’d buy 50 grams and reduce the dose every third day. Like 10,10,8,8,6,6,3,3,1,1 or even just jump off after 3. You could even do it at a quicker rate than that like 10 the first day, 8 the second, 4 the third, 4 the fourth, and so on.

I would avoid subs unless you have a history of chronic relapsing. Your history of use doesn’t seem extremely bad and I think it’s a good idea you putting this behind you now. Smart move"

Get instagram pics of some cute but not hot chick and say they were hers and you broke up so you can’t have her take a pic in them or holding a sign etc to prove she’s real.  I’ve sold about 20 pairs for $20-$100 each.  One guy gave me $500 if they were really dirty, I just worked out and wiped a brand new pair all over my swamp ass and sold them to him.  I’m sure he rubbed his face all over them but that’s his issue not mine.  I actually used real pics of my ex gf so I had pics of me and her together and she was pretty damn fine so it was perfect.  If she woulda found out I prob woulda lost an  eye.

Only the occasional day here n there where nothin was happening and i had to actively make somethin happen.

For like the first 8 years using id have like 2-4 people call to taje them tocmy dude and id get crazy deals where they were better off goin thru me and splitting the half or gram with me. Or i have been on subs for like 80 monthly scripts and 3 a day is 40-50 bucks per day. (but i always went for the ""pickup script of 90 subs then sell 10-20-30 asap for only 10 each, then after 1.5-2 weeks im down to 3 subs to make it the next 2 weeks...""

I had guys to sell gift cards to for more than the crappy 50% that most stores and gift card machines paid.  I worked at a butcher shop the first 5 years using and i had a guy i could snag some steaks chops sausages hamburger patties etc from the freezer and he'd buy a box of frozen meats for like 100 bucks. Had a guy that would buy.

Its not really a ""work a regular job then when you end up broke and sick one day, then just ""get ur hustle on one time"" type of a thing"". In my experience its almost like a job in itself. More of a daily thing where you put in the work getting numbers of people that wanna buy things. Or meet people in your daily life that dont have a car or plug. But then those people arent gonna wait 4-8 hours till after ur done workin."

It really wasn't uncomfortable at all. I would dose small amounts of sub, then a bit after do my dope on top of it. I didn't get high anymore from the dope really , but it kept me from sickness and i felt as normal as you can expect to really. 

With Bernese you dont really have to wait, id start at the beginning of a new day tho and have a tentative schedule in mind to follow. It depends what you're using, but id plan to slowly induce over 5 days or so and really if possible it's ideal for all the dope you use during the time to be from the same batch so you can have more accurate dosing.

With a 5 day plan, the idea is to slowly induce small amounts of bupe alongside your dope while decreasing your dope intake by 20% per day til u hit 0. 

You have the right concept in mind but the bupe doses youre thinking of using are too high and increase too fast. 

Here lets say you use 1g dope per day. So then day 1 take like 0.125mg bupe, then 0.8g dope.. day 2 0.25mg bupe then 0.6g dope.. day 3 0.5mg bupe then 0.4g dope.. day 4 0.75mg bupe then 0.2g dope.. day 5 1mg bupe and drop the dope. Then start increasing your bupe as needed, id recommend 1-2mg more Every 2 hours until you feel reasonably comfortable.

Yes that's why you induce the bupe slowly in Micro amounts to letit build up in your system. By the time you reach 1mg, you'll be dropping the dope anyways."

Nah, cause you've been building up bupe in your system. 

If you're at 12hr mark and only mildly sick that sounds too soon to induce yet

You have enough dope to Bernese with. Even if your starting point was 19 bags. And you. Could increase your bupe slightly faster thab my example Ive given ppl, because your using so much dope it'll override it and therefore you can get to 2mg instead of 1mg by day 5imo..

With the amount you have plus that fear I could extend it to either a 7 or 10 day schedule that work up to 2mg bupe gradually nd you'll be golden if done right. Esp if 10 days. But its up to you if you have tb3 willpower to stick to schedule and are willing to spend a week or 10 days on the transition"

4079,Why do I never feel better after taking subs? Am I causing mild precipitated wd bc of this fent dope I always use?,"I have given up trying to start subs ever since i was on subs for 2.5 years then relapsed on dope for 3 days in like 2016. Ever since that relapse i have tried to take 4mg or 8mg and even a small 1-2mg piece, and its pwds every single time.  even at 80hours clean i still got mild-moderate pwds for ~6-7 hours the last time before i gave up. In the first year after that 2016 relapse i had tried like 15-20 times before eventually losing my job. Subutex also Did the exact same thing as suboxone .

Subs used to work perfectly at 12 hours clean for the first ~6-8 years using 80mg oxy then 40mg opana per day. Then ~ a half gram of dope per day

Towards the end of my opana use then dope use (like 7-10 years into usijg), i started taking sub at like 18-24 hours clean and i would feel like 50% dopesick for a day and laid in bed or on the couch, then day 2 on subs id feel feel okay enough to eat and move around.

Then i actually started taking my subs and didn't relapse for 2.5 years. For about 2.3 of those years i was strictly shooting 0.5mg iv at 8am then another 0.5mg iv when i got home from workin 9-10 hours fixing cars. (I shot it because it lowered the half life from the sublingual 35-70hour half life down to intravenous ~7 hour half life. This meant that i could feel each shot spread out every 12 hours. Id start to feel sick by 8am and start to feel sick again by the 8pm shot.

When i relapsed at 2.5 yrs on subs, there was already starting to be fent mixed into the ecp heroin. This was around 2015-2016. I did notice over the years it got harder and Harder to get on subs, but since 2105-16 i just can not take any bupe.  I have dozens of pwd experiences and it got to where id buy a half gram of dope just to wait 24 hours,take 2mg or less bupe then get pwds starting and do a fat shot of dope to stop the pwds. There's almost nothing worse than waiting 36+ hours till youre sick as fuck then take a tiny 1-2mg of sub, then lay there waiting for 10-20 mins and sure as shit you start getting the hot/cold sweating, horrible feeling that you cant even just lay there cause its so bad that all you can do is get dope somehow to stop the pwds.

I think its a combination of subs working less over time, and these fent analogues just last too long like methadone does. I distinctly remember this one time a few years ago. I was getting the same tan fire dope for 6 months and was positive for opiates(heroin morphine) and ""fent"" analogues. I used then went to bed, woke up and waited all day to get sick enough to take sub. At 11pm(24 hrs clean) i didnt feel sick enough and actually still slept moderately well, woke up and had an 11am appointment and finally started getting sick during the trip to the appointment. Got home and took a tiny piece of sub and got pwds....

I know carfentanil has an 8-9 hour half life and that's like 3x longer than heroin/morphine.  Not sure about the other fentalogues like furanylfentanyl acetylfentanyl sufentanil flourofentanyl etc etc. These fent analogues are prettymuch brand new and have no info. Carfentanil is only known because its been used on large animals"

I think its a combination of subs working less over time, and these fent analogues just last too long like methadone does. I distinctly remember this one time a few years ago. I was getting the same tan fire dope for 6 months and was positive for opiates(heroin morphine) and ""fent"" analogues. I used then went to bed, woke up and waited all day to get sick enough to take sub. At 11pm(24 hrs clean) i didnt feel sick enough and actually still slept moderately well, woke up and had an 11am appointment and finally started getting sick during the trip to the appointment. Got home and took a tiny piece of sub and got pwds....

I know carfentanil has an 8-9 hour half life and that's like 3x longer than heroin/morphine.  Not sure about the other fentalogues like furanylfentanyl acetylfentanyl sufentanil flourofentanyl etc etc. These fent analogues are prettymuch brand new and have no info. Carfentanil is only known because its been used on large animals","It really sucks that they're cutting this stuff into the ecp and making it so much harder for people to get onto subs. And they also cause overdoses sometimes like what is wrong with just making money off heroin alone I don't fucking get it man like stop cutting this stuff in there.

Have your PWD ever been like puking bad? mine never get that bad but I get extremely anxious and restless every time I try to convert to subs. Have you ever tried something called the bernese method? I think I might try that or just go ahead and get on methadone as that will be much easier than waiting through days of withdrawal to get onto subs."

What you're describing just sounds like the normal crappy period of adjusting to the subs.  When you get pwds you can't even just lay there without shifting around every 10 seconds. Not to mention the complete misery.

4089,"Dont say that, wtf. Mixing fent+ket with amphetamines would NOT make it any safer, dont do this!",It doesn’t make it healthier* but nmda antagonists like ketamine are counteracted by high dopamine levels and stimulants reverse opiod respiratory depression. I’ve seen heroin overdose reversed by amphetamine and cocaine multiple times. If he doesn’t wanna pass out  or black out amaamphetamine sure would help. Sure it’s no naloxone but I’m sure he doesn’t wanna go to a hospital and if he can type all this on reddit I’m pretty sure he won’t die. There really aren’t any super serious interactions between stimulants and depressants like a lot of people say.  But really fent only lasts an hour so it’s probably over by now.

Firstly, there's hope. You can do better. You can repair your relationship with your family. It's possible to be a decent person. All of that begins with making a choice. A choice to clean up your act. You can make that choice. Not going to lie, it's hard as fuck. I wouldn't wish the hell of withdrawals on anyone, but if you ever want to get out of this dysfunctional cycle, you're going to need to go through withdrawals..

It's kinda like that saying goes, ""It's gonna get worse before it gets better,"" that's what withdrawals and early recovery are for me.

really? thats awesome for u, im glad. ive seen people say it cost 1200$. many addicts dont have insurance tho. i cant get it rn so viv would be impossible. luckily, suboxone works for me

>I wasn't trying to be senseless just trying to guide people to a med that really works and you never havta be dope sick again.

the med (viv) works if you want it to.. but plenty of ppl try to break thru it and its very dangerous. people on MAT also should never be dope sick again if they taper off properly too

>ubs are wonderful for getting you off dope but really should only be used for a week and be a quick taper. That's my two sense.

whys that? some people need longer term maintenance. and also, there are plenty of addicts with overlapping pain issues. so thats a conflict for that group 

im glad viv works for you, sincerely. im not knocking it. just pointing out that it doesnt work for everyone, some ppl try to break thru it and its very dangerous to do so, some people cant afford it, etc. and some people just need maintenance meds. its diff for everyone so whatever works for each person i support

If someone is legitimately unconscious, then waking up with a sore eye is the least of their problems (and they’ll never know how they got it anyway) but if they’re pretending to be asleep or something as a way to malinger or get attention, then this will *instantly* wake them up/snap them out of it. 

The eye is pretty tough. But make sure their eyelid is closed and utilise a modicum of common sense. Try it on yourself and see if you couldn’t flinch if you didn’t know it was coming. It’s more aggressive than a sternum rub, but hey you gotta do what you gotta do."

Next, recognizing another persons of is as simple as a sternum rub. If they dont respond narcan em."
4276,"Help, how to recognize overdose?","What the nursing staff where I work uses, in plain English:

* slow breathing or apnea (the involuntary holding of breath)
* deep guttural breath sounds, gurgles, prolonged punctuated snores. Usually people report the breathing of an OD patient as “sounding wrong”. Respiratory secretions can also build up so they’re breathing might sound “wet”, but not always.
* failure to respond to stimulus including yelling, light slapping, vigorous sternum rub, poking the soles of the feet, tickling, etc.
* grayish or bluish pallor (pale skin color)
* 🤮 
* clammy sweaty skin, but not always
* unusual body position for extended periods of time. Contortion. We’ve seen people hurt themselves from the positions they pass out in - serious side effects including damaged vertebrae, and other muscular problems. This isn’t part of the canonical OD symptoms but it should be.



**You should never use alone because you won’t be able to identify these on yourself**

The discussion on how to know between passing out and OD’ing is moot - you typically won’t know you are about to OD especially with IV. With snorting you’ll have more time but it still might be difficult. There are Apps you can put on your phone that can help protect you if you are using alone.

4277,"Help, how to recognize overdose?",I’ve never OD’d and I’ve been using for 8+ years but I’ve been to the brink and honestly it’s one of those things similar to dying I would assume where once your in it your in it. There is no realizing your overdosing and having time to call 911 or anything like that. If you’ve done too much your out like a light switch.

Once you reach 1/3 of your original dose, then slow the taper by half if you feel it appropriate. Then you’re good. 

But that’s just my experience with deprescribing."

4295,Modafinil for withdrawals?,No es bueno.
4296,Modafinil for withdrawals?,"Bad idea!!! I have modafinil in my medicine cabinet right now thats gathering dust.. why? Because it induces such serious anxiety in me that when I take it, I end up trying to compensate by taking more bupe. It never works..but hey.. addict brain here! 


Modafinil works by inducing the activity of orexin a and orexin b,  which are hormones secreted by the hypothalamus to regulate sleep.  It is also a very weak dopamine/norepinephrine agonist.  You certainly do NOT need to be kept awake during withdrawal and nor do you need to take anything and causes more norepinephrine to be available!! 


Stay away from stims during withdrawal.  Some folks seem to think that they work great, but thats the rare exception.  Not many people truly enjoy feeling their skin crawl, with restless legs, sweats and all that jazz and even less people enjoy having those feelings while all jacked up on something that increases those effects."

4331,How often can you use opiods without gaining a tolerance?,"Realistically you should be able to use opioids 1-2x per week without ever becoming physically dependent. 

The problem is, nobody is ever able to maintain a regular usage schedule forever (whether it’s once a month, or once a week, or whatever). Honestly you sound like you’re already psychologically addicted, so it’s just a matter of time until an all day, every day physical addiction follows.

My advice? Quit now while you still can. If you really and truly want to maintain a lifelong recreational opioid habit, you need to limit your usage to 1-2x per year. 

Good luck."

4333,"There is no such thing as using opiods  recreationally. If you're thinking about it, or cant wait till next time, then u're already addicted and eventually u'll fuck it up","Only way you can use them with some semblance of recreation is if you basically use Kratom daily so it’s like a maintenance drug that is safe and relatively less addictive in comparison to methadone or like suboxone, and then you use your drug of choice opiate like once a week, every 2 weeks or once a month. 

And with all the fentanyl on the street these days always either use at a safe injection site or use with a friend that has narcan, and a lot of it, Just in case it’s some really strong shit with a big fentanyl hot spot. I’ve heard of fentanyl overdoses depending on the type of fentanyl and how big the hot spot is taking like 6 or more narcan shots back to back to bring someone out of a big fentanyl OD.  Hopefully your city has safe injection sites though you so you will have someone with proper training there to bring you back and give you oxygen other stuff to make sure you are okay and don’t end up falling out again.

That or maybe just decide to leave this game as a whole behind you... your feature opiate free self with thank you down the line."

4335,How often can you use opiods without gaining a tolerance?,Monthly? Most people will eventually succumb to addiction but it's not like it's impossible to use them every now and again.

4362,When can I fill my script?,"I fill my Xanax every 28 days at CVS (1mg, QTY 90).  Might be different with benzos than opiates, though."
4363,When can I fill my script?,"My opiates benzos and adderall are all written every 28 days for a 30 day supply.  Never had any issues getting any of them filled.

A couple times I had to get them filled an additional few days early, so 24ish days, and my pharmacist just told me I'd have to pay out of pocket."

4377,HELP! how to buy needles?!?,"States are allowed btw. that will make your post easier. And as second thing and as someone who dont lives in the USA, and in a country where you can get syringes without prescription, we alsondont got prescriptions for syringes, I went everytime in the pharmacy and told them I should get some syringes for my grandma who has diabetic but IDK how they are called and asked them friendly if they could show me the ones who are mostly sold for this illness. Every pharmacist was very nice to me and went and got mostly 3 different types and then I said oh thats hers, I recognize them, then they asked how many I want if they werent in a pack of 10 already. Alwqys bought 2 or 3 bags of 10 syringes and needles, they always knew, i think at least, whats up and gave me free alcohol pads too. Only got one time denied when I wanted to buy oral syringes cause I was at the time in the hospital and had a butterfly in my hand which I wanted to use. I then went to my room again and boom there were already a pack of 10 oral syringes with many other Equipment I didnt saw. It was in every room so I took that and went with my spoon and syringe to the bathroom and used the butterfly the nurse put in my hand that morning. It was in there for 3 days and that were the easiest 3 days of shooting dope. Also I switched then to buying them online. You can buy them at Amazon for example. Its nice to get your shooting Equipment delivered to your house. Also bought cookers and wheel filters online. There are also extra sites for all the Equipment we need for shooting dope safely. I cant understand why pharmacist denie new unused syringes to us. Its like they want us to get infections and track marks. I think its more than stupid that you need in some US states a prescription for syringes. I cant understand some of your laws. But also my country got many stupid laws. Like if you go to rehab or detox you get immediatley a note in your law report that you are a drug user and then when your driving and they check your plate that note pops up and they immediatley stop you and are allowed to drug test you without any suspections. Only because you were in a rwhab/detox and got help. Its like they want you to fail at that and then catch you driving under the influence of drugs and taking your driving license for at least 6 month plus you have to drug test every month and do course again which you already did to get your driving license and that course costs about 300-500€ plus 100-1000€ for driving under the influence of drugs. Sooo stupid but hey welcome to fucking Germany. Also they are allowed to test your nearest family (mom, dady bro, sis) only because you wanted help and went to rehab or detox. How stupid is that? But sorry I got off the main thing. If you dont able to buy them in a pharmacy go and check amazon they sell pqcks of 100 pcs. Best of luck."

4380,HELP! how to buy needles?!?,"I'm not like a mod or anything, but I mail cleans if people need them. I currently only have 29g 1/2 inch which is a big needle tho, you probabaly wanna start with 30-31, 5/16 inch.

Let me know if you need help with anything at all, I think the other people have answered how to get rigs pretty well.

I could video call and help you get down a safe injection technique if you need the extra help. There's some stuff I've seen people do seriously wrong that can mess you up.

A couple examples:

(Disclaimer; this is stuff that can happen. Not will. Ive only ever done two things on this list; missing and hitting an artery. I hit an artery because I was being stupid and unsafe, trying to hit super deep veins)

Digging. Do not change the angle of the needle while it is under your skin. Pull it out beforehand. This is called by phlebotomists ""raking the vein"", which I think paints a good picture as to what that does to your veins.

Going at a super steep angle for no reason. Go at as shallow an angle as possible; but still go at an angle that works for you. I personally need the long needles because my veins are shallow. The deeper you go, the more likely you are to hit an artery

Hitting an artery. This one is hard to avoid entirely so you need to be able to recognize the signs. When you register, you'll get very bright blood, not dark like venous blood. It may be frothy, and it may pull in extremely quickly or even push it's way into the needle without you pulling back. Pull out apply pressure. If you do inject into an artery, it will immediately feel like burning and your hand will swell up too big to use for a week or more.

Missing. Missing a shot is bound to happen at some point. It's usually not a huge deal and will go away on its own, unless the redness starts to spread, or it gets bigger more than an hour after the injection. Go to the hospital if this happens as it is infected and will seriously fuck up your arm if you do not.

Not injecting toward the heart. You should always have the needle pointing to your heart. So if you're hitting on your forearm it should be pointed towards your shoulder."

 if your veins are shallow, wouldnt that mean closer to the surface right? if the crook of your arm is facing up like it is when you shoot up. i dont understand why that would require a longer needle, i would think you wouldnt need it to be as long if the veins are right on the surface? can you clarify. and also im a super small guy, does my size/height/weight etc effect the size of my veins? i had a friend go to donate blood and they said his veins were ""too small"" what does this mean? is this possible and if this were to be the case does that mean i just wont ever be able to hit a vein? gonna pm you right now btw regarding you sending clean rigs. thx a ton my man, seriously helps."

4384,HELP! how to buy needles?!?,"Just call around to pharmacies and ask if they sell syringes without a prescription. 

If you are in WA, then pharmacies are allowed to swell them, but each town or pharmacist may have their own rules:


https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.115.050

For instance, there’s a city where I live, which I would expect pharmacies to sell them, but apparently no (at least chain) pharmacy will sell them without a prescription. 

I go just over the line to the same chain pharmacy and was able to guy a pack of 10

Personally I like the 1cc 31 gauge 5/16” needle length. I’ve never need anything longer than that, and whenever I’ve used a longer needle, I’ve been more likely to miss by going completely through the vein — not fun. 

Make sure to use a new one every time! I pretty much do, although here and there I’ll reuse one a second or third time,but when they cost ~$0.35/ea (pack of 10), there’s really no reason to reuse. 

Stay safe."
4385,HELP! how to buy needles?!?,"I’m California, Walgreens tends to be the best. Not sure about up there but try looking online for your specific state"
4386,HELP! how to buy needles?!?,"A lot of this you could have learned via Google. I use 29-31 gauge (higher gauge = smaller diameter, like with piercings), 1cc and half inch, but sometimes they don't have this available and I use whatever they have as long as the needle length and gauge are good. 

In my area you can buy syringes without a script but its up the pharmacist's discretion. I walk in and up to the pharmacy counter and politely say, ""Hi, I need some insulin syringes... 29g, 1cc half inch, please."" If they decline, I move on. Some just don't get that access to clean needles is in the best interest of everyone in terms of harm reduction. I have the best luck at Walgreens and Walmart.  CVS is hit or miss for me. They can turn you down for any reason but can't ""call the cops"" on you or anything... simply possessing unused syringes in the absence of drugs and paraphernalia is not illegal afaik. Google laws and policies for your specific area for more information. 

Amazon is a great option if you're worried about being turned down. There is also tons of info online about this stuff. Don't be lazy and Google it! Good luck ✌🍻"

4402,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,Just stop it now before it gets worse man just end it any withdrawal will be nothing to what you could be facing down the road. You’ll be restless but trust me don’t continue this. Get through it cold turkey you can do it so easily
4403,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,Quit while u can before u have nothing and your sick
4404,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,"No, just stop. Your first habit takes about a month of daily use."
4405,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,"You will likely have some minor wds. Nothing toncompare if you keep using for another 2 weeks. Your brain can now easily switching back to produce the needed endorphins, dopamin etc. and also cold turkey will be good for ya if you have wd symptoms then you can learn from it also cause being sick sucks and if you dont use you wont get sick. I mean some ppl I met really learned from their wds and said they never want them again others like me dont learn from it, I for sure went in my 5 years of full blown addiction through more than 20 wds most cold turkey or with just benzos and Loperamid. Only a few times with Methadon or other opioids which didnt made me high but I tapered down on them and then just had 2 days of flu like symptoms. I also needed 5 years to learn how to use just enough to stay well and taper down with H. So its a slippery road which mostly ends in dead and I think its better to stop for you now than keep using and having real full blown wds. I wish you the best of luck mate."

4408,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,"As others have said, your tolerance is still fairly low and you haven't been taking them super long so your wds will be pretty light and shouldn't warrant tapering. The main thing is that you stop now and for good. The alternative is a road you dont want to go down. Good luck man! You're doing the right thing :)"
4409,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,"Any withdrawal symptoms will be relatively mild and transient. It usually takes several weeks to a month or so of daily use in order to become physically dependent, which is a prerequisite for experiencing withdrawal. But no one can say you won’t be dependent on day 14 of use, but dependent on day 15. It’s a process, not a point in time. 

Regardless, if you cold turkey now, it’ll be like a cold or mild flu like symptoms."

First time experience with a girl who's previously been an addict like me; what to expect?,"I’d say just ask, if your comfortable with her just have conversations and pay attention to her responses. What comforts someone is always gonna be unique to them. As far as if she values you, you just know. Most women become more readable as time goes on, she will show she values you, first and foremost by spending time with you. It’ll be in how she looks at you and the times she uses. Good luck."

I remember truly believing that the gravy train would never stop.  But, all of our crooked doctors started getting popped one by one and our numbers got smaller and smaller.

I remember truly believing that the gravy train would never stop.  But, all of our crooked doctors started getting popped one by one and our numbers got smaller and smaller.

Thinking back, I'm not sure I've ever purchased more at once for personal use... I bought LSD by the book as a teen, but was selling it (and it was way less than 2gs anyway). I only buy for personal use in my adult life. 

So that's about 2 large for about 10kMMEs, give or take a bit. I'm totally happy with $0.20 per morphine equivalent milligram, since street price for oxy is about $0.65 per MME ($1/mg, 1mg of oxy=1.5 morphine equivalent milligrams). Oh, and a handful of ecstasy.

But it’s exceptionally effective at treating neuropathic pain (similar efficacy to methadone) something which opioid agonists are generally pretty shit at treating. 

As I alluded to, it exhibits agonist activities at all of the opioid receptors (don’t be tempted to take a bit extra due to the Kappa agonism though), functions as an NMDA receptor antagonist (again similar to methadone or ketamine etc) and also exerts effects on monoamine transporters. 

Ahh yes, fluoroquinolones the bane of tendons everywhere. Out of curiosity, were you being treated with glucocorticoids concomitantly with your course of antibiotics? 

It’s an excellent analgesic and I’d expect very good things from it. It also has far less of an effect on the cardiac QT interval, which is a definite plus and it doesn’t really interact with the CYP system so there’s a greatly reduced chance of interactions with other medications that are metabolised by that route. 

All in all, it’s a good choice."

I don’t understand why doctors push so hard with Cipro and Levaquin when their are alternatives that work just fine without ruining people lives. I never showed and bacteria for my prostatitis and every doctor I saw kept putting me on more fluoroquinolones. 10 weeks in all. The damage to my body from those side effects are incredible. I have a very hard time now with memory, I feel like I now have a learning disability for me to learn something new is almost impossible and the stuff I already know seems to be fading. It’s given me floaters and flashes of lights when I look at things from nowhere. Pain all over body and a feeling of impending doom. I have ligaments torn in my foot and the surgeon said until I recover more from the FQ toxicity he will not do the surgery because he said the toxicity heightens the pain to a level I won’t be able to bare. He put me under just to do some stem cell injections and I came to with blood pressure 220 over 205 and thought I was going to die. The FQ toxicity is a living nightmare and those drugs should be ban or used in the most desperate of cases only."

4582,"Aside from a lab, nope.",damn
4583,damn,If you are willing to wait forever you could send it to Energy Control and have them test it I guess.
4584,Is there a way to test for carfentanil specifically?,Not outside of a lab.  The hospital I ended up in the many times I OD’d on Carfentanil actually had to send the tests out specially to prove that I was OD’ing on Carfentanil and not just regular Fentanyl (because what sort of pussy would I be if I just OD’d on regular Fentanyl ;)
4585,Is there a way to test for carfentanil specifically?,Carfent is one of the fentanyls that the strips from dancesafe test for.

4588, How would you start out? There’s so many types. Thank you.,"The first time i tried kratom i ordered the smallest bag (an oz) of green, and two reds i think and went from there. I found out that any green strains tend to by my favorite but i also recommend red and white. I mix a spoonful in to a bottle of water using a small funnel then shake the bottle and drink it. A lot of gas stations and smokeshops also sell it but it's pricier, although the one ive gone to has decent kratom. Id be happy to answer any more questions if there's something specific. Am i to understand you've never tried it before? Hopefully you're at least in a legal state."

Depending on how you wish to consume it, I would start by taking around a half tablespoon to a full tbsp every half hour to an hour until you start feeling some relief. I think i saw that you mentioned imodium in another comment and that stuff has worked quite great for me, especially fighting suboxone withdrawal.

Will it completely take away wd's? No

My best advice to you is to wait until you absolutely can't stand the wd's anymore. The longer you wait to take kratom, the more relief it will give you. Kratom affects everyone in a different way but MY dosage for dealing with wd's, whether it be dope or sub wd, is about 4-5 grams of a red strain. I've dosed kratom 4 to5 times a day during the worst parts of wd. For me it helps alleviate the RLS as well as the mental angst we get from wding.

That doesn’t sound weird what sounds weird and just a little unexpected to me is that it seems like you can just start taking methadone immediately during a heroin habit and avoid withdrawal completely. That seems odd to me because I have always been used to having to go through a withdrawal period when getting on suboxone. Because I’ve always used suboxone I am always nervous about having to wait the required amount of time to induct the buprenorphine after having a heroin relapse.

In my experience, it is also much cheaper than Bupe and gets you higher than Bupe so I’m more of a Methadone man.

Methadone is turbo strong and it has an ultra long half life so if you end up addicted and get WDs, it sucks a dick.  I kicked Methadone, 220-250mg a day, in County and that was one of the worst experiences of my life.

I am in the US, but I’ve been around.  In a lot of Heroin producing nations, Thailand for example, they do a 3-5 day detox with Methadone.  They give you an equivalent dose to whatever Heroin you were doing, stabilize you on it for 3-5 days, then stop the Done.  You still get cravings, sometimes PAWS too, but the brutal acute phase doesn’t happen.

Last time I was shooting I was shooting about 1.5gs a day of raw Heroin.  My withdrawals were so bad that when I kicked cold turkey, I used to have to ride it out in a bathtub as I’d pour sweat, shit, and puke.  When I came off the last time, I took 120mg for the first 3 days, 80mg for the 2 days following, and then jumped.  I still had a bit of insomnia, I was only sleeping like 4 hours a night, but I was sleeping and I had no acute WD.

If you look up Methadone rapid detox, you should be able to find info online."
4646,Are you not in the US?,"Hope that helps...

You can do kind of the same thing with Bupe, but with Bupe you can end up in PWDs which, having been through that at least 5 times (a few times admittedly intentionally), I would recommend just about anything else.  I ended up staring at myself in the mirror laughing and crying at the same time with a gun to my head it was so painful once (and the depression is gnarly).

As a final note, though, I would not recommend mixing Heroin with Done.  I’ve done it tons of times, but it’s a mega quick way to kill yourself (and Done binds so tight it’s hard to reverse).  I’m not 100% on this, but I believe that’s the cocktail that killed River Phoenix."

And I would definitely use heroin on top of methadone if it’s going to help me get through the first few days until they get me to an appropriate dose. I mean I just want to get on medication assisted treatment in the easiest way possible. I’ve been on and off suboxone for years and I’m terrified of inducting suboxone every time I relapse.
4648,What is starting methadone like? How are the WD's compared to starting subs? I've thought about doing a bernese method taper to start subs but I'm also considering methadone.,"Even if 30 mg is not high enough to hold you, you could just do a few bags of H on top to of the done while they raise your dose 10mg/day until ur comfortable.

They had no issues raising it as high as I wanted.  I raised it so high I would start nodding out anytime I sat down for a few minutes.

What was your experience starting methadone, was there any discomfort?

What do you mean by it’s a small price to pay compared to the possibility of having to jump off methadone at a large dose?

Have you ever missed a dose of methadone or gotten to the clinic too late bc you couldn’t wake up in the morning?

And yes exactly dude it can be so hard to induct properly with all the debt dope now. I can go 16 and a half hours and be feeling minimal withdrawal and be scared to take the subs because I don’t feel like I have a bad enough score on the cows scale yet but I’m still feeling shitty enough that it’s bothering me and I want to just take the subs"

4653,What is starting methadone like? How are the WD's compared to starting subs? I've thought about doing a bernese method taper to start subs but I'm also considering methadone.,"Methadone is a full agonist opioid (just like heroin), so taking the right sized dose would have equal analgesic effects as your daily heroin habit. It’s half-life is much longer than heroin, however, so you only have to dose once per day to avoid withdrawal. The first problem with methadone is that most clinics only start you at 30mg, and this may not be enough to completely mitigate the withdrawal symptoms from a large heroin habit (64 bags a day is quite a lot- I would imagine you could handle 200-250mg methadone easily). So you may have to endure some withdrawal symptoms for a few days until the clinic staff can get your dosage right. The other problem with methadone is the clinic itself- you’re going to have to stand in line with a bunch of scumbags at 5 or 6am every single morning to get your dose. After you’re in the program for 6-12 months and turn in clean UA’s over that time frame, they will start to give you “take home” doses so you only have to come to the clinic once a week. 

The other option is Suboxone, but the induction period is much more painful... but on the plus side, Suboxone clinics will typically give you an actual 30 day prescription once they get your dose figured out. Which means a clinic visit only once per month.

Personally, I like methadone.... mainly because I’m a fucking junkie and I like to get high. Suboxone is not going to get you high, but methadone will. Good luck."

I had same issue needing pain relief while Bup on my receptors. Ended up having to take about 20mg of Subutex to get any kind of relief. 30mg would've prob eliminated pain entirely for me. You'd be better off just upping your dose of Bup. Take 2 to 3 times the dose you normally take and you should be feeling better.

Also, when I had surgery on my femur they gave me IV ibuprofen and it actually worked quite well. There was some issue with my insurance or cost so they had to use opiods, otherwise the IV ibuprofen would've worked totally fine."

4713,"I have broke my back, im on daily bupe... they are giving me ora morph hourly?????",They should give you Temgesics .2 very hour that will work!!
4714,"I have broke my back, im on daily bupe... they are giving me ora morph hourly?????",i would be using ketamine in this situation for sure. its not an opiate but would absolutely work for this situation and is known for helping pain
4715,"I have broke my back, im on daily bupe... they are giving me ora morph hourly?????",Fentanyl  would be strong enough to knock the bype off receptors
4716,"I have broke my back, im on daily bupe... they are giving me ora morph hourly?????",I am ashamed of our NHS sometimes I really am. Ask them how they expect to hook the morphine molecule to your Mu that are full of Bupe?
4717,"I have broke my back, im on daily bupe... they are giving me ora morph hourly?????",You wouldn’t be given hourly Oramorph unless they were clueless. Ket is a good shout as suggested above 👍

4723,"First time opium, help?","Opium will ruin your glass pipe. I would use tinfoil, and chase it, if I didn't eat it. Besides, who gives a fuck about aesthetics. We're trying to get high. And honestly, if your experiences with oxy weren't mindblowing, don't expect to be blown away by opium. Any opioid high(short of IV roa and maybe rectal roa) is gonna be pretty simple. It just makes you feel good, no more, no less. It's really a benign drug, to start with. Only when one becomes a junky does it become an absolute necessity.

EDIT: I would definitely smoke, instead of eat, actually, as you don't know how good the opium is, and it is a lot easier to pace yourself when smoking. Less risk of OD."

EDIT: the oxy I had wasn't really oxy, it was oxycodone but it came with nalaxon.","Holy fuck dude. You shouldnt give a fuck how it looks. Tinfoil and also a tinfoil tooter are best to amoke opium. You said also that you just got one g so I think you want to archieve the best high from it. So the best high is if you smoke it. You also can dose it then perfect. Also you can smoke it in you glasspipe but there will be lwftover which are black and wont really go away also the taste of opium will stay in the pipe everytime you hit it. You can smoke it in there and then get a new one. The glasspipes are just a few bucks. So if you give so much on how it looks then smoke it in the pipe and get a new one for DMT. I know I payed for mine 5€ and it was for smoking meth and crack. And I often tasted the meth when I smoked my crack I rather should have gotten two seperate pipes. Also if you smoke it in the pipe think about that you dont burn too much. Turn your lighter on minimum and dont hold it to near on the pipe. Its easy as this. Also you can clean the pipe again after smoking the g and smoke the leftover residue like people smoke their tinfoil tooter. For opium tea you need more. And also as others said you dont know how strong it is so smoking it is the best idea since it takes some time untill the tea kicks in and if its super strong you can OD. So if I were you I would now choose between tinfoil or your glasspipe. But it runs better on the foil and you can better chase the dragon. IDK how high your tolerance is or if you even got one but your best high will be if you smoke the opium and also the best bet is the tinfoil. Can I ask why its so important to you how it looks? Do you just do it to look cool or do you do it to get a high? Thats the question you have to answer for yourself. Also will you be alone or with others? Cause if you are alone then it dont matters how it looks. I never had a purse like in pulp fiction. But I always managed my life good. Had a good job etc. currently I am because of illness not able to work but still I manage my daily life pretty good. Clean house etc. often the guys who got all their ahit in one bag cant handle their life. They manage to hold their job but more worse than good, their house/Apartment is dirty, their clothes often got holes from nodding out while smoking, their car is fucked up etc. they look like full blown junkies. I just had one binge for 3 month where I really looked like a junkie, pale white, dirty hands, car, house, etc. but its your decision which you have to choose. I wish you anyways happy nods and that you can enjoy the opium. It got a really bitter taste much more bitter than heroin or like smoking some pills which I also never understood why people do that, its just a waste. I think you dont swim in money otherwise you would have more than one gramm of opium. Anyways I dont mean all that in a judging way. I just want that you think about it again maybe.

I don't know anybody who'd be up for that experience, maybe I do but I'm to shy to ask. 

Another guy also talked about ""chasing"", now you put it in the context of ""chasing the dragon"". I'm not very familiar with the term chasing other than following or trying to catch up with someone or something. It'd be great if you could explain it.

I care for what It looks like because it stays with you. I enjoy taking walks at night and one time I went through this pitch dark alley. I was embracing the silence and the darkness, minding my own business when I suddenly stumble upon something, as I wasn't sure what it was, I took out my phone for the light and there I see someone (someone I knew) crouched in the corner smoking meth off of a thin foil. It was awkward especially cause we ""knew"" each other, not like everyone already knew he was a meth-head but he still had his reasons to go halfway through the darkness, so he could enjoy himself. I don't despise these people but I don't want to relate them either. It's like drinking in the park, people take their six-packs and liquors and have a party. Unless you are underaged and have no option, go to a bar; it might cost more but it doesn't hurt to drink a few less beer but do it in a civil manner. It's a dirty picture, that you'll keep with you. As I mentioned if you have a carafe and a bottle of orange juice, you'd definitely be pouring it into when having breakfast. You put your tuna onto a plate and don't spoon out of the can. It shows a lack of self-respect and a distorted value in aesthetical and moral terms. It reflects desperation, uncontrollability and it kills some of the high. 
I mean, take acid, coming back home on acid to a dirty room just kills you. Maybe it doesn't kill you but there is a 100% noticeable difference, the whole experience is based on your environment. This accounts for all drugs, some are more subtlely influenced than others by it. Same for coke, when I'm home I go to the bathroom every 45-60min when I'm out in comfort (not that I ain't comfortable at home), same stuff, 60-90min.
The main reason is the underlying notion and vibe a clean environment gives off, it lets you enjoy the drug a lot more.

The pulp scene, it's not whether or not someone actually has it under control, it's about the impression it gives off. The reason I have one gram is that I just want to experience it and not be doing it again and the day after and so on, once is enough for now. I could have bought 10g and even saved money, it just doesn't seem smart if you don't know what you are up to and your past opioid experience hasn't met your expectations. I really hope this one is different. 

Anyway, I really want to know what you guys mean by chasing."

Anyway, I really want to know what you guys mean by chasing.","Chasing the dragon is related to smoking heroin on the thin foil. While your lighter is under the foil you move the foil and lighter a bit like trails or circles or whatever and the Heroin on the upper side is changing to a reddish color amd is running on the foil and the smoke is going up in the air and you have to chase the reddish H and chase the dragon means catching and inhaling the smoke. So I see there no problems but thats up to your choice. If you feel better if you dont chase the dragon on foil then thats fine for me. Then I would really suggest that you use youe glasspipe, I think thats more aesthetical for you. Then you have to use your lighter on minimum and dont hold it to near on the pipe, you need to experience a bit first also remember to turn the pipe slowly to the right and left side the whole time while you smoke. And if the pipe is to black afterwards go to a headshop and buy a new one if you often use the pipe for DMT, meth, crack or whatever. Also the Heroin or opium, they both turn the same way when smoked are reddish amd like syrup so go slow and easy. Also reddish is the best color because that means its not cut much. If your shit burn super fast and or is darker and darker then the quality isnt the best, at least at heroin but the one time I got free opium (5 tester with .2 in each bag marked with strength and purity) it was also that the bag with 90%  was  reddish very clear and light and the bag with 40% was a mix of a very dark reddish and a bit of black22 color. And didnt run as smoothly as all the others on the foil. I guess you ordered it online.  So if you ordered ""Bayer"" opium which I see often online. The tester were Bayer opium too  and it was good. Ao I would suggest that you use your glasspipe and do it like I described it for you and remember if it gets heated it should get to a reddish syrupy like. Then you do everything right plus turning your pipe right and left and the most important thing is I think you guess it? Yees inhaling. But its very bitter and vinegary like. So have fun and be safe and happy nods and like I always say, you can take more anytime but never less so start low and then if ita not enough for a good high then put some in your pipe again and do it again. I will also take a fast look if I can find a video of how to chase the dragon so you know it.

Camping there. So uncomfortable. Thank god that I didnt took opis back then when we often camped. I dont know where I should rail my lines. Cause nobody knew I was using back then. Only chilled two times while actively using at the bathing sea and everytime I drove there so I went two or three times alone to my car and used there or in a changing booth. But it was always risky as fuck. Now a days I sadly lost contact to my old gang cause of using but we are currently startes texting again and making plans for a meeting to clearify everything and maybe it will work out and I can hang out with my old friendos (best friends, group of 4 with me, knew each other since school) that would be great. They stayed with me while detox/rehab and the months I was sober after rehab but I stopped contact everytime I relapsed cause I was using at every relapse soo badly and looked like I gonna die in a few min, pale white, got thinner and thinner, black eyes etc. and then I was full of shame and stopped contacting them.

Crush half and parachute it (put the powder in a gel cap if you have some or some kind of paper and swallow)

As far as I know all Tilidin Generica contain naloxon, so snorting is not an option.

Don't expect to much for some there euphoric others find them sedating



Happy Nods my dude"
4750,Do you know tilidin?,"So since you got no tolerance I would start with max 100mg, which will give you a decent buzz, Tilidin was also my first opi. I guess they are 200/16mg Tilidin/Naloxon Extended release (Retardpillen) So if you are from Germany you got for 99,9% ER pills cause the IR (immediat release pills) are only prescribed with a BTM script and then the doctor often prescribe rather Tapentadol or 10-30mg morphine and sometimes but not often 5mg Oxy with naloxon mostly. So Tilidin is also prescribed in Bwlgium, Switzerland, parts of Africa (mostly OTC there) and some parts of south America. Anyways Tilidin is a prodrug that meams it gets metabolised to nortilidin in the liver so snorting them is a waste. They should have a breaking line in the middle of the pill. So break it in the middle them you got 100mg. 100mg are safe if you got no tolerancw and also you shouldnt get nauseas or not that much from 100mg. You can also break the half pill again to ca. 50mg but 100mg are in my opinion safe and you will also get a decent buzz. Take the 100mg amd after 5-20 min you should feel them. Sadly it could be that you have to puke from the 100mg but I dont think so. If you dont get any decent buzz from the 100mg after ca. 1-2 hours. I would at least takw another 50mg or the other 100mg. The first time I took them, they were my first opi, I took 200mg and got super nauseas, then the second time just 100mg and I was super relaxed. And after about 3-6 hours you can take the other 100mg to be super relaxed again. If you got any questions etc. answer me here or PM/DM me. Have fun. Be safe and keep in mind as much fun and satisfaction, relaxion, euphoria (Tilidin just got a super small euphoria) etc. opiates got, they are a slippery road. I am now addicted since 5 years and pretty good fucked my life up. I nearly died of them now 6 times. Also you got a good chance that you will lose Friends and Family because of them. You will lose much of time. You will lose friends to them. So much more. So make sure to just take the 3 pills and then never look back my friend. As said for more questions or concerns you can PM/DM me. But now have fun :)"

While the water is boiling you drop the powder into the water. Before doing any of that have a rig with the point through a filter. Start drawing up as soon as the powder hits the water. You will draw up the drug and not the binder. We used to do this with the first few OCs that had binders in em. I know for sure we used this technique for MS too.

4781,How long do i have to wait to redose codeine?,"Not sure on the grape fruit part but for your redose question I might be able to help you. It generally depends on the amount that you took.

When I was taking tylonol with codeine (30mg codeine) I would dose every 2 hours, however I was using it for pain and to keep my Hydrocodone wd's at rest. But... to answer your question, if you take a large dose of codeine and are high, I would wait for the high to were off and take another dose 6 hours after to ensure it's out of your system. But be cautious this is how you can develop tolerance/addiction. If you wanna avoid those 2 then I would reccomend dosing once every week or 2."

4836,very interesting. any idea why this works?,"I believe it has something to do with the way the liver processes medications, something like grapefruit juice interacts with the liver/pharmaceuticals making the liver take longer to process it and thus potentiating it. Not sure if this explanation is exactly on point as I can't remember exactly how it works, but I'm trying to find some research on it to link here. I'll update if I can find anything to explain the science of it more in depth. (:

Edit: So it's not liver that grapefruit interacts with, but rather intestinal enzymes increasing the bioavailability of some pharmaceuticals (especially opiates) and thus potentiating the effects. 

Here's some links explaining the science behind it:

4864,Wet Dope...How to Fix?,"You have to open them up and scrape them with a credit card pretty much as soon as they get wet. Usually the glue holding the glassine together dissolves or whatever and the bag starts to open where it was glued together, then I carefully pull it apart/open where it was glued, over a flat surface and scrape the bag. If you wait too long, the dope dissolves and the bag starts to absorb it.. once that happens, there’s pretty much no chance of salvaging the dope that has been absorbed, regardless of how well you dry it out"

If you are only using 12 tabs use about 100ml of luke warm water to dissolve them. Don't bother crushing either, this way you know everything is dissolved. Don't let it freeze at all, it just needs to be as cold as cask lager from the pub. Any colder and it will filter as slow as shit. As long as you can see the separation you are good to go.

4903,"It makes me hatte society so much, the fact that I can't enjoy a plant (Papaver somniferum), without being criminalized drives me crazy, we need decriminalization so bad",I mean dope is a little more than a plant lol but yeah I get what u mean
4904,I mean dope is a little more than a plant lol but yeah I get what u mean,"Well Heroin metabolizes into morphine in the liver, so you could say Heroin is actually ""less than"" the plant itself;  as P. Somniferum has other centrally active molecules as well as morphine (which makes kicking the tea so horrible).  It is more the route of administration with Heroin.

I wonder, if Heroin wasn't injected, say it was drank - would it be seen as such a bad drug?  I think one reason alcohol is accepted more, is because it is drank  and everyone drinks fluids.  Whereas H has to be administered via IV  and that frightens people."
4905,Anyone else feel like this?,"Are you taking about waiting in a parking lot or inside some place? If I see a marked car anywhere I get on super high alert.

Because if you get asked there’s no real good reason you have to be sitting there if you’re not from that neighborhood or don’t know anyone for real in that immediate area. Plus you never know what areas they profile.

I got pulled over literally just for coming out of a gas station once. They didn't even try to give me a reason, I guess they just thought me and my bf looked like addicts. I had literally just stopped there to get cigs and I was about to be so fkn devastated bc I was sick AF and about to go pick up too but I had stopped at the fucking gas station on the way there so I could get my stupid cigs and I had a warrant so I just knew I was gonna get popped. Luckily though they let me go without taking me to jail bc they asked my bf to give them a dealers number and they would do he just gave him the number of someone we used to go thru who was already in prison for dealing, that way he wasn't really snitching, and they let us go thank God. I've always been so pissed about that bc they had no legitimate reason to pull us over other than thinking we were addicts I guess, like we weren't even really in the predominantly black part of town yet, it was a very mixed area, so there was no reason to think we were addicts for that reason either, and we weren't far from our house either. It's fucked up. Cops are the biggest fucking gang in this country"

As long as you aren’t drawing any unnecessary attention to yourself or looking suspicious like constantly looking over your shoulder or you’ve been loitering for a long time just looking sketchy you’ll be OK inside of some place even if a cop does come in. 

They’re most likely there to just take care of some errand on the clock unless someone called them there for some specific reason. Keeping your cool around them takes practice. It doesn’t always come easy. Just gotta ignore and act normal. But always be aware."
4910,Anyone else feel like this?,"i feel your pain. my anxiety is through the roof while on the pick up trip. im overly cautious on the drive home, constantly looking around for cops; even cars that could be under covers cause me anxiety. newer ford explorers, tahoes and chargers are the models that local police drive so i have learned to recognize the shape of their headlights so i get nervous if i see any of those in my rearview. knock on wood i’ve only been pulled over once while riding dirty and i got so nervous you could hear it in my voice while talking to the cop, but long story short he let me go and i was shaking so bad i had trouble changing gears as i drove away. 
i’ve been lucky so far but those anxiety attacks will likely be my downfall. it doesn’t hurt to be overly cautious though. i never ride with more than i can swallow if necessary, always have a drink with me for that reason, no lights out on my car, tag is up to date and always follow the rules of the road. don’t wanna give em a easy reason to pull you over y’know. sitting somewhere waiting to meet someone is nerve wracking but i’ve never had any issues thus far. this is the one area where your anxiety can come in handy by being as cautious as possible so you can make it back home each time."

If I see one near where he wants to meet at I call him and tell him 12s there meet me over here in this other area. He does the same thing if he sees them, also if we see any after we already met we always call and warn each other too.

But I do always get a pit in my stomach if I ever see any. And I won't really sit in my car on the side of the road somewhere unless it's too dark to be able to see me in my car and I always duck down too without lowering my seat so it looks like it's empty. There was one time I was meeting my dude on this one street but he wasn't there yet so he told me to go wait on this lil side street near it so I pulled over and waited but there were some people who pulled onto the street bc they either lived there or were working at a house on it. So I waited a couple more minutes but it just felt too hot to be sitting there when those people had driven by so I just left and drove up the street he wanted to meet on then drove back down it and when I passed by the lil side street I had been on there was a cop parked right where I had been so thank God I listened to my gut and left instead of staying bc of my lil junkie brain telling me not to leave bc he would probably be there soon.

Ever since then I've never ignored a gut feeling again and I will not sit on the side of a residential street where no one else is parked on the side every again."

Some people will park in a really empty parking lots or in back and but they just draw attention to themselves. Your always better where no one expects you to be doing that shit, in almost plain sight.  You don't want people to be able to look right in and see what your doing. The most important thing is not sticking out, you wanna blend in and take cover behind the way things should look or most often do.

I'll ask my Dr about it when I have my review next week. I'm not too comfortable asking for pain meds because I feel like some people look at me like a drug seeker but I don't really have a choice though given that what I currently get isn't agreeing with me.

4966,150mg Morphine ER Pills - Did I OD?,No what you experienced may be an allergy to morphine. For some reason straight up morphine effects people in really strange ways. I have an extreme high tolerance to morphine and I turn bright red and become hot and itchy before I experience any pain relieving effects. No other opiates do this to me.

Get swollen and red and itchy and shit like that, delirious and uncomfortable. It's basically just like a big global allergic reaction"
4968,150mg Morphine ER Pills - Did I OD?,It surprises me that you were this up and about but as far as getting energy from a large dose of opiates it happens to me also
4969,150mg Morphine ER Pills - Did I OD?,I’m just shocked any ER gives any opiates short of having a severed limb. I’ve gone many times with acute withdrawl because my doctor shut down and they didn’t give two shits. I had kidney stones and I just eventually sat and the toilet and passed them but was sweating so bad and felt like I. Was going to pass out. I tried the ER even before they passed and they did try to break them up but still they have me nothing and told me to pass them

In the past the stones started small and were managable with ibuprofen and paracetamol. As the stones got bigger and more jagged they upped me to codeine and after that tramadol. After tramadol stopped helping with some of the nastier stones they gave me a one off prescription for oral morphine for extreme cases back in august. I held off on taking any until saturday because I know how addictive it is. I was just so desperate though that I caved.

I can't really describe the pain to it's full extent, I'd say it was kinda like I had a fish hook on the end of a strand of barbed wire attached to my kidney, and someone was trying to pull it out through my urethra.

I'm hoping the docs can find out what is causing these stones to form one day. I'd do anything to prevent them coming back. I've got a big one lodged that won't pass and the theory is that minerals are sticking to that one then breaking off due to the combo of diet and meds I am on. I'm on a waiting list for surgery but the waiting times are insane here in the UK. Hopefully I'll have it done early or mid next year according to my urologist."
