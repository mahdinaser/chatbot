I wish i could go back to 25 and decided to get clean then because I didn\u2019t end up hitting rock bottom and going to rehab until i was 27. Keep going to school, get your degree and things will work out. I wish i could offer more advice but the fact that I\u2019m struggling very hard mentally makes it difficult, you do not have to be in the same situation at 29 if you continue on the good path you are on now.", "4423": "Waking up is tough and it\u2019s hard finding happiness within with out drugs I\u2019m struggling daily but I have so much hope and I know once I find my sweet spot of happiness and once my actions start speaking for there self then I\u2019m going to try and rekindle the broken relationships due to my drug addiction I thought instead of speaking about it I\u2019m gonna do it and then once they see from the outside I\u2019m really serious then they can enter my life if they want I\u2019m all alone I did this to my self I have to bounce back it\u2019s sink or swim and I see the light at the end of the tunnel but I know it\u2019s gonna take all of my energy and devotion", "4424": "Damn you got into med school with an opioid addiction?

IDC if I can't sleep, im gonna listen and be interested until I pass out. I work a lot, saving money to go back to college. But the every day being better should give you tons of hope. Sure you have a shit day, but push through and fight for a better tomorrow. You know what happens if you use again, you have a mediocre / kinda fun night, then you feel guilt messing up the high, and what waits on the other side is pure shite. So fight it.   \n\n\nI also use kratom daily, and I'm working to reduce it. I was going alright with it then my life pretty much exploded. Not going back to hard opiates is the best thing about it I've done. And I would use because my homework was a day late, but I haven't with the sudden death of my father and brother. So push through. Don't think about being sober for X time in negative terms, like you have to do it etc etc... Just make it one more day, one more day off of hard opiates is a win and as you said it makes things better. But do think of your cumulative success, you are working to make things better.  \n\n\nThink about a five year plan. Where do you want to be? Surely getting rekt was fun, but if I looked back and just got high for 15 years I would feel absolutely terrible. So I work towards my future.

I was addicted at 15. No chipping for me, I took it everyday after my first time. I\u2019ve progressed to all the opioids/opiates and now I\u2019m finally getting off kratom next week after a taper(don\u2019t get on kratom like others are saying, it\u2019s just another opiate and it makes my brain foggiest out of all of them.). Anyways I\u2019m 28. That\u2019s a lot of time on opiates and I\u2019m in for a rough ride. I\u2019ve been practicing mindfulness and it helps me. When I feel an intense emotion I try to observe it and process it as a third party. Doesn\u2019t always work but it helps. I\u2019m doing solo and group therapy and even though I\u2019m not a fan I\u2019ll probably hit up some meetings. But what\u2019s really helped me is I have a big goal I set for myself in a year. It gets me excited and gives me purpose. Once the years up, I\u2019ll find something else. Yeah we don\u2019t know who we are or what we are doing. But guess what? No one knows who they are, and if they say they do then that\u2019s their ego talking. And no one knows what they\u2019re doing. We are all just fumbling for our keys, hoping to unlock something bigger.\n\nKeep going. Things will fall into place if you implement gratitude. Good luck and I\u2019m right there with you. \n\n\nAlso I detoxed off a high sub dose. It\u2019s the worst, it\u2019s seems like it\u2019s lasts FOREVER.

You\u2019ve already gone through the hard parts of detoxing and getting yourself out of the daily cycle of drug use, now you just need to tie up the loose ends and finally end this chapter in your life so you can go to the next one. It sounds like the best thing for you right now is some good old fashioned sit in a chair, tell your story and work out your feelings with a psychologist type of medicine. \n\nYou\u2019re a doctor so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll know plenty of psychiatrists who can give you a good recommendation for a shrink. It doesn\u2019t even need to be someone who specializes in drug abuse per se. When you boil it all down you\u2019re just a person who has experienced some trauma and needs to reconcile some stuff so you can move on. That\u2019s exactly the kind of things shrinks are great at.\n\nDon\u2019t try to go about this alone, as a medical professional I\u2019m sure you can see the value in having a professional help in the healing process.", "4429": "Hey. \n\nKratom. \n\nMight keep you straight. If you don't know about it, there are subs for it. Kratom 101. I'm happy to recommend my fave source.\n\nTime to get to know yourself. Hard as fuck to do. I've been a boozer for a long time; started at 14. Went sober a few times... decided I was kind of way too fucking intense without alcohol to dumb me down and have been trying to keep it cool for a while now. Realized in my first (ahh.. second..) stint at sobriety that I hadn't figured out how to deal with my emotions. Turns out I'm bipolar.. dealing with that. Fucking juggling always.\n\nI could go on and on (I might..) but I think that all I really want to say is: get some fucking therapy. It helps a lot. If you've got the insurance, see a therapist. If you don't.. see a fucking therapist or go to a support group. Ain't nothing wrong with that. Sometimes our loved ones or friends/associates can't offer dick for perspective and you need someone impartial. Ain't nothing wrong with that, there's actually a lot right. \n\nI went through 1.5 years of therapy after I almost killed myself in a manic episode (yeah, I got problems but it wasn't intentional). I've been in and out of therapy since. I take a mood stabilizer.. shit works, didn't want it but it really fucking helps. \n\nIf you find a shite therapist, move on to the next.. find one who works for you. Don't get discouraged.\n\nThing is.. you've been rewired. Your brain chemistry is irreparably changed. Drugs did that. Kratom would probably help but you will probably need some pharmaceutical and a decent amount of therapy to deal with \"re-entry\" into the world.\n\nIt's alright man. Shit's hard but I think it's meant to be hard. The stuff you were taking made you float through it all but you can't do that anymore if you really want to be alive. I mean, feel things... emotions are a bitch but they can be pretty great too.\n\nI loved opiates but didn't have consistent access to 'em. I think I'd be dead if I had. So, boyo, be glad that you are still fucking here. Seriously. Look at this shite we have today. Motherfuckers dying left and right. Know that you are strong. \n\nPreserver. Live. Experience. Kick some fucking ass. Get to know the world.. it's actually pretty fucking interesting.", "4430": "A big thing for you is you\u2019re literally going to have to figure out who you are as a person now.

You just gotta get out there and find out what the fuck you like to do and what you wanna be when you grow up. \n\nI agree with the previous poster who recommended therapy, I think it would give you a great starting point for figuring things out.", "4431": "Yeah, I\u2019ve been through this. It\u2019s basically the school of hard knocks - you\u2019ve got to take what you learned and grow from it and make a pact with yourself to be the best you can be and do twice the living for a while. The alternative is to wallow in shame and regret which doesn\u2019t help at all. I feel like recovering from addiction can really build you into a strong person. \n\nChin up and all that.

Granted I smoke a lot of weed.", "4434": "Bro, your sobriety will eventually give you everything that opiates promised they would give you... take some time getting to know yourself... meet people, work out, read books, and take comfort in the fact that you don\u2019t have a guilty conscience every day. \n\nDon\u2019t use Kratom like an above commenter mentioned, for two reasons: 1) you are not in acute withdrawal. You don\u2019t need it. And 2) you, like myself, are an addict. Even if it\u2019s something legal like phenibut or kratom, there is no need to introduce something like that into your life. \n\n\nI\u2019m 29, been clean for over 5 years, was previously very addicted to oxy and made some bad decisions on cocaine. Similar situation to yours. Feel free to PM me anytime. I\u2019ve seen the same psychiatrist for around 5.5 years that helped me get clean... prescribed me subs one and then helped me ween off of it. He helped me understand what problems I had that I was trying to use drugs as a solution for. \n\nGood luck!", "4435": "Keep yourself BUSY! this is the most important thing for remaining not only happy, but it gives you time to genuinely relax and de-stress. Try and utilize a form of intense/moderate exercise, this will help a LOT with improving your Dopamine striatal density, this will make you feel more motivated, content and academically sharper.   \nI'd recommend communicating with an online or over the phone therapist, psychologist or GP (if you wish to keep your past habit a secret), ask them what resources or tips they can give you for life as a young adult.   \nThere are many young-adults who have ADHD/ADD/Attention issues/Depression and other disorders which severely altered how they were able to adapt to adult life, there will be solutions.   \nI am currently just trying to get clean, but even in my pessimistic state i know that it is possible to be successful and happy. Treat your opiate years as a time of being VERY sick, anything you failed, did wrong etc, don't feel guilty, drug addiction is a LEGITIMATE disease (as is Diabeties Type II, which you can develop), your brain was really undergoing big biological changes and had to adapt to the external opioids. The more you practice good habits, the stronger it will become the norm. People doing good things tend to have a pattern of constant improvement, a upwards snowball effect, the same can be attributed to those going down hill, it will just get worse and worse, so keep up going up hill :).", "4436": "I've talked to people who still don't feel right after quitting subs for a year", "4437": "Hey man, when I quit for a couple years at the beginning I had some of the same issues.\n\nWhat helped me immensely was the gym. Helped me build a schedule, grow some self confidence, and give me a project. I think it helps a tonne. That and learning how to eat, are important lessons in life anywhoo. Be strong and be healthy.\n\nOtherwise, it's hard to mingle. Normies you can't share stories and experiences with, they just don't get it, and opis are always a risk of relapse. If you want to stay clean, be careful who you date. Don't pick the girl that drinks a bunch of beer on the weekend and smokes; you find reasons to slip.\n\nGood luck dude.

He did transition to kratom for awhile (which I did read some above are not advising that). I take kratom on occasion myself for pain and anxiety.   However, you gotta take the DLPA.  Its an amino acid that helps w the brain's pleasure center.  It helps tremendously with recovery.   I was taking oxys recently after surgery.

Get a job, make some friends, do some regular things, and get a taste for everything normal again. As long as you just keep moving forward in life, you'll find an answer to the questions you're asking now by looking at the actions you take as you go through life.

People who use it say to stick with once a week to avoid tolerance / withdrawal, which might contain more insomnia.\n\nAside from that, you could see a psychiatrist about ambien or off-label quetiapine for your sleep troubles. I take an antipsychotic for other reasons, and it really does help with rest (quetiapine is one). They have scary side effects, but when you're dosed for insomnia, you take less, making the probability of adverse reactions low.\n\nThen there's the standard sleeping pill OTC anywhere - Benadryl. They just repackage it into a blue/black box and charge more, so if you want to try it, buy regular Benadryl. Take 25-100 mg, as little as works. It has a downside of not working forever since you'll become tolerant to it, but it can come in clutch once every few days. I find Benadryl sleep to be very refreshing.\n\nIf you can find some in the streets, Xanax is also nice once in a full moon if you can't sleep. I would recommend it last though since it is its own addictive substance unlike the other recommendations and also causes insomnia during withdrawal.\n\nAs for something you can research, look at medical journals weighing the benefit of things like l-theanine and other supplements on opiate withdrawal / depression / anxiety / whatever you're struggling with.

Everything changed when I got my own script of K56\u2019s this May.", "4459": "Like these folks replying to your comment touched on, opiates initially helped energize me and keep me high-functioning during college... but every week that passed by I was using a little more frequently, rationalizing just one more dose for the day... By the time I finally got into medical school, more hours of every day were occupied with thoughts of just staying home and using... The way you rationalize is crazy. I used my fear of failure to tell myself I deserved some respite from the pain.. even though the only one inflicting pain on me was myself. \n\nI knew that this career path I'd worked so hard for years for was really just a thin tightrope I walked between being a dope-head on the corner and being an upstanding citizen that people look to with respect. I clung to it like a life-raft. My first semester of medical school, I would show up at my Suboxone appointments dressed all professionally like I'd just left class or clinic. I was just putting on a facade to help myself feel like I was somehow different from these other junkies that were coming in... But I knew it was a facade. I knew I was no better. It came to a point where that line became so thin, that I knew if I didn't reach out for help, I was going to succumb to this sickness and die. \n\nMy doctor who was managing my Suboxone during my first year of medical school agreed to have him and his team come with me to talk to the faculty at my school and set up a plan for a leave of absence. If it weren't for the overwhelming understanding of my school and their facilitating a medical leave from school after first semester, my crash and burn story would've rivaled the Titanic. They really showed pure faith in me and my ability to find my way back to myself, and that's what drove me to an iron fucking conviction that I was going to kick this shit once and for all. \n\nI moved home to be with my parents for 6 months. I did a very steep taper over 10 days (was on 16 mg/day) and went through about 6 straight weeks of a withdrawal depressive state I wouldn't wish on any human being. There was no color in the world. I was constantly in pain. The voice in my head kept telling me I would fail because I was, by fundamental nature, nothing more than a worthless addict. The hours dragged on every day, and every morning I woke up feeling no better. My inner voice taunted me, telling me I was clinging to a career as a physician like a life-raft that would deliver me from having to face that I really was, all along, destined to wind up spending my days hustling up as much money as I could for a hit and that real fulfillment would never be mine.\n\nMy loved ones helped me through that. But there were so many days, 2, 3, 4, months since my last dose.. that I wouldn't like how I felt or I couldn't handle the intensity of all my emotional faculties returning to me like this.. feelings I hadn't felt since I was young. But when the fog lifts, you see all the selfish destruction you've caused to the people who love you and the guilt just eats away at you.\n\nBut I pushed through every fucking day, looking myself in the mirror and reaffirming my choice to find myself again. Here I am, almost 7 months out and... very slowly, mind you... but more days than not now I'm able to feel happiness in a way that I never was able to on opiates. Like a poster above said, sobriety will give you what opiates promised to give you in its warm but deceitful embrace as it leeches everything good out of you. Now, when I'm working rounds in the hospital and I see a pediatric cancer patient's scans come back showing remission or a parent looks me in my eyes and thanks me.. I can viscerally feel the emotion, the fulfillment of knowing I'm on the right path to fulfilling my purpose. And as many days as I come home to my empty apartment and want to pity myself or engage my frustrations that I'm still this far out and having to put in daily, conscious work on changing my psychology.... I'm finally at the point where nothing in this fucking world would make me trade my life as it is now, even if hope and joy and purpose only show themselves fleetingly for now... for a life that's 100% the best opiate high obtainable. 5 minutes of Meaning > 20 years of floating opioid narcosis. \n\nThanks so much to all the friends that have commented here with great advice and encouraging words. I will be the best fucking physician I can possibly be and I hope to be able to help people like you all and your families with the perspective I've gained from being in that dark, hopeless prison of addiction... and forging my way out. Those who have experienced the deepest pain are the ones most capable of appreciating the beautiful joys life has to offer.

It kills 100 times more ppl than illegal drugs? Politician: Cauae alcohol is legal!!\" Like wtf girl? Whats wrong in your head. Why do you do that job if you know nothing about drugs. She also thought that smoking weed ince will lead you directly to an H addict. What a stupid cunt. I am really looking forward to the new girl and which intelligence she will have... normal Doctors are allowed to give out mdone for cancer patients, but noz for substitution. And also .4mg subs for cancer and if you get mdone/subs you will get an extra licwnae to drive cause addiction is in their eyes no sickness. Its a choice. Yes in some way it really is a choice but at some point you really need help but cant get it. Sorry for the rant but these old bastards making me so sick. I think these old bastards should be addicted just for one week and them they would change a lot. And after one week of addiction they should be dopesick for two weeks straight with the worst symptoms you could have. Such mfucker. Man I am sorry for the rant but I could be happily on mdone and have a great career again but I am stuck in this shit currently cause no one is willing to help me. But I found a great programm now, since I got PTSD and major depression and am bipolar I could go on a few weeks programm for that and they oftwn got ppl with addiction problems (I think its some sort of rehab but not listed as rehab so you wouldnt get treaten everywhere like a junkie) \n\nOne more thing I was in hospital and laid in coma for 4 days, and stayed 3 more days on a extra watching station, onw night on a normal station amd then after lunch the doctors came and told me that I had to go home cause my lunga, heart and kidneys are ok again plus my brain preasure is ok too. I was in hospital 7 days and when they found me at home I was dead. I had no pulse and was not breathing and all that piece of ahit doctor said was\" Better stop doing drugs think of kurt cobain etc. all of them died young because of drugs. \" When I came there I had no drugs in my system. Such mofos. And the old man in my room who got a bit of a pain in his left lwg was already there for 5 weeks. And got 150mg morphine, 70mg oxy and 40mg mdone. I said to him that I got pain too and he gave me his mdone the 2 days I was there cause he didnt liked it and gavw it back every time. Also he gave me once 20mg of oxy. That was a great day. \n\nCause back in 2005 his son was a H addict too and wantes to get off but couldnt get into the mdone programm so he (his dad) went out everyday to pick up mdone for his son so his son could get a job etc. His dad has done this 4 years now his son is completly clean has a wife and 2 kids plus his own construction company. The old man is for me a hero. He helped his son, paid everything and now his son does everything for him. Thats a real man and a real dad. Hw said everyone deserves a second chance and if his son struggles again hw would do the same again. Hw also gave me 1/4 of his fent patch for later at home. I thank him so oftwn and he said I dont have to thank him. He just helps the ones who are good but sont get the help they need. I hope they coule locate his pain and that he can walk normal now again.", "4356": "Yeah it's always got $$$ and no plugs or lots of plugs and no $$$", "4357": "You could use some benadryl instead, then. \nIt should be a lot cheaper than suboxone.", "4358": "What about those payday loans places?

There's a HUGE urban myth that combining opioids and stimulants in general are somehow magically more dangerous than the sum of their parts. In reality, that typically only applies to combining coke or crack with a typical duration opioid like heroin or oxycodone. It's because cocaine is very short lasting (usually only 30-45 minutes maximum), meaning that it wears off and the user potentially overdoses from the heroin alone.\n\nAs long as you're either taking an opioid dose you know for sure is safe for you even without stimulants, or as long as you don't combine coke/crack with common opioids or medium-duration stimulants (like ritalin/focalin) or possibly moderately long duration stimulants (like adderall/dexedrine/desoxyn aka prescription meth/street meth) with possibly suboxone/subutex but especially methadone or full spectrum opium, you should be perfectly fine.", "4135": "You say that you take oxys for pain?

I understand that fear of dependence on something, but there is a huge difference in physical dependence and addiction, the latter of which encompasses an array of negative social, behavioral, and health outcomes.\n\nWhy not give yourself a year of maintenance? Or two years? and then taper down or off, which is always an option.  It\u2019s a long taper with bupe, but it can be done comfortably. It\u2019s a bit more difficult to taper with methadone due to how it is typically dispensed at clinics. \n\nAnother advantage of buprenorphine is its opioid-blockade effect. It helped me because when I craved hard, I knew it would be useless to use as I\u2019d feel nothing unless I waited a day or however long for it to wear off, which gave me time to get through the cravings and take my bupe the next day.\n\nMaintenance won\u2019t solve all your problems, but it\u2019s a useful tool that gives you time to address the other issues in your life that keep leading you back to addiction. Think about that... If at all possible, see a counselor or psychologist that specializes in addiction.

Read some actual scientific reviews of climate change and try to see if you can at least understand the actual scientific contentions: i.e. humans have released large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over the past century due to industrialization --> due to the greenhouse effect co2 reflects infrared radiation back to the earth and insulates the planet creating warning proportionate to the amount of green gases released --> the planet warms rapidly far outside of normal geological warming and cooling periods which should take 1000s of years to occur --> the sudden increase in global average temperature alters the biosphere in ways that is negatively determinal to humans --> famine, drought, extreme hea t and weather, ocean acidification, increased disease burden from climate change, etc. \n\nI know it seems like stupid liberal propaganda, but the majority of money against climate change comes from the fossil fuel industry which has billions invested in mainting short term profits at the expense of our grandkids and their kids future.

So say Wed is the day you will be out of dope or need to stop by. You can start the process on Friday or as late as Sunday in my experience. You want to cut up your buprenorphone into small doses. This is very important. I was on the 8mg/2mg Strips.  So just use simple math to get down to a dose of 0.25mg. (If you have the 8mg strips that is equal to 1/32 of a strip). If you cut the strip into 8 pieces and then each piece into quarters it equals 0.25mg. \n\nDay 1:  \n     * Take 0.25mg buprenorphone (suboxone, subs, etc.  It all will work the same).  Wait 20-30 minutes. Take your first dose of dope as usual. Same dose and same time.   You should still feel your dope as usual. \n\n    * Repeat the first step for your 2nd dose of the day. If you need to you can do the same with a 3rd dose. \n\nDay 2:  \n     * Take 0.5mg of bupe. Wait 30 minutes and use your dope. Use a normal amount of dope. \n\n     *Take 0.5 mg of bupe. Wait 30 minutes and take 20% less than your normal dose of dope. \n\n     *May repeat for a 3rd dose of needed. \n\n      * The first dose of this day you might feel slightly diminished results from your dope. By the last dose of this day...you may not feel too much from your dope. This is a good sign that your receptors are becoming saturated with buprenorphone. This is the goal for induction and is a sign that you are safe to continue and stop your dope very soon. \n\nDay 3:\n     *. Take 0.5mg of bupe. 30 minutes later take 20% less than your decreased amount of dope from the day before . \n\n     * 2nd dose take 0.5mg of bupe and 30 minutes later take the same amount of dope as your first dose of the day. \n\n     * 3rd dose...if you have not been experiencing withdrawal symptoms...take 0.75mg of bupe and same dose of dope as before. \n\nDay 4:\n     * Take 0.75mg of bupe and 30 minutes later take 1/4-1/2 of your original, pre-induction amount of dope. \n\n     *Take 1mg of bupe and the same amount of dope from dose 1 of this day. \n\nDay 5:\n     *Take 1mg of bupe. See if you have any worsening symptoms in this time.  If you do NOT don\u2019t take any more dope.  If you do rinse and repeat from the day before and attempt this step on day 6. \n\n     *have dope on hand if needed...but I have never needed it. If no w/d symptoms (nothing worse than what you felt when you woke up....which I never felt any other than some fatigue) flush the rest of your dope or donate it to the needy...I am sure you could get ample addressed on here to mail it to if needed!!  JK of course. \n\n     *I have done this whole process successfully in as few as 2 days...but would err on the side of caution the first time you do it just because we all metabolize and respond differently to medications and such. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have to take any dope you are ready to find your comfortable dose of bupe:\n     * If you need to you can repeat the 1mg at 12 hours after the first dose on the last day (the day you don\u2019t take any dope). I have found that 2mg is usually plenty and makes it easier to do a quick taper if that is your plan...and either way easier to get off of even if you plan to do maintenance. \n\n     * With some of the insane fentanyl analogies you may need a higher dose of buprenorphone, and in that case you can dose every hour (after repeating in 12 hours from the first bupe only dose) until you get to a tolerable level or lack of symptoms.   This titration is to be done at the end of the process once you are off your dope and only taking subs. \n\nBest of luck to you fam!!  \nBlessings!!\n\nEdit:  formatting.", "3473": "if you're doing fetty, this method wont work.", "3474": "If I am understanding what you are saying, you are not describing the Bernese Method.

Keep in mind that September 12th of this year, a little more than a week ago was exactly 10 months that I\u2019ve been into my recovery from Heroin, and I am on Zubsolv for maintenance. \n\nWhile we were at her house and we were smoking bud and she was doing shots and I would shoot her for her, I had picked up a bag of her dope just to see how decent it was, and it actually was brown, which is rare around here, NW suburbs of a very large, midwestern city. \n\nAnyways/ long story short, every time that I hit her, about 13 or so times total in the 2 or 3 days that I had shot her up, I hit each time and didn\u2019t miss a drop. \n\nAnyways, on a certain day of last week, a day or two after she had shot up herself and then I came over and did it for her, she developed an abscess due to her not knowing what the fuck she was doing, and her going in the same spot thinking that was okay. She has *very little* knowledge of harm reduction other than \u201cwash your hands, only reuse a needle 3, 5 times at the most, don\u2019t do too large of shots and always do a tester shot\u201d, etc., but still, she\u2019s an idiot and continued shooting herself up *knowing that she was missing just because she did not want to snort it*. \n\nSo in conclusion, no, I do not want to relapse.

I made the decision then to stop, but my Zubsolv has been a MAJOR crutch for me in my recovery; and although I fucking hate it sometimes, I can say that there is a good possibility that I would have relapsed and been right back to where I was 10 months ago had I not been on it since I\u2019ve been in my recovery from H.  \nNot to mention when I picked up the bag at my friends house I smelled it, and I smelled that vinegary smell and for some reason it smelled good to me rather than bad like I thought it would, and I say it like that because I\u2019ve never been face to face with heroin in these past 10 1/2 months.

In my experience subs do better for people whose addictions are a few months, a year or two long but methadone does best for those who\u2019ve been hooked for years in end.

Trying hard to not give in to a worse situation.  If I were in that place again where work made me sick like you are now I would get out sooner somehow.   It was for the family but it kind of  ruined the family a lot because stress and illness from stress.  I was there for too long, I finally quit after I got sick from it.

Not sure I know anyone with out anxiety now because even if you never made a mistake life is harder then it used to be.  I read a paper I found today that was from 1989.  The price of things really was surprising  to me and I was there.  A new car was $10,000 same car now 25,000.  It is definitely harder to get by monetarily and everything is so stressful. They should offer massage at work before you leave to drive home and hand you a cup of coffee or wine and cheese.   I am taking my one ambien and saying my best advice is find another support outside the family that you can sit with or skype with  then make a plan and take your time because there will setbacks.

They know me and my scripts personally and always help me out by giving me my medication even if my insurance is acting up and won't approve it for some reason and tell me to just take my meds and come back and pay when my insurance goes through, etc. So I think they know they are filling them at the same time because my doctor has been writing the scripts weird and making mistakes on date and amount dispensed at my expense and won't fix their own mistake and just tell me to deal with what mistake they wrote date wise, unless its overprescribed . They know I live sort of far from the pharmacy and saw I would have had to come back in a few days so maybe just gave them to me the same day?

Everyone thinks they can manage it without ruining their lives.  I'm constantly vigilant & weigh the risks vs. benefits DAILY.  \n\nUnless you have a severe, disabling physical or mental condition that can't be better managed with other treatments, opioid use is not the best option.  And with mental illness mgmt it should be a last stop before suicide IMO.  The risks are simply too high for most people.  Exhaust every other option first.

Once you start banging you very VERY rarely go back. \n\nBut yes you can shoot up and not make consistent track marks. But it takes disciple and skill to be honest. Some people are just better at shooting up than others. The key for me has been understanding how fast scar tissue develops and giving the needle marks time to go away/heal. \"A needle mark is a needle mark\"\n\nFor me it took time and the process sucked and was humiliating. Just like most people I started shooting in the crooks of my arms and when you go on a bender you shoot up multiple times in the same spot, re use needles, and if your starting off you just generally fuck your shit up with misses and improper technique. I definitely had track marks at first and I've had ones lasting months that have eventually gone away. \n\nBut eventually through trial and error most dope heads with any bit of finesse figure out how to reduce/avoid the tracks.

But, for a couple years off and on I've been doing heroin and when I do heroin I bang it cause why the fuck would I do it any other way? I've done it before and it's arguably the best way to do it.

I basically just use my left forearm cause I got a big juicy vein running all the way up/down it. The thing is, a needle mark, is a needle mark.. 31 gauge makes the smallest mark and usually goes away within like a few days I wanna say..

When I'm using I shoot up between 4-8 times a day. There are dotted lines going up and down my arms and biceps. Within 8 days of stopping I'm back to wearing a T-shirt around my family. \n\n\nIf you start shooting you'll end up with a favorite spot. Its inevitable that you'll find a place that's easy for you to hit and that you can register consistently. Save this spot for emergencies after you find it.

And it's legal and accessible everywhere so it becomes routine. \n\nOpiate addiction for me was shitty for sure but I was able to power through it.

Obviously easier said than done but yeah. Alcoholism can be worse than any junk habit, it destroys your mind and your body irreparably, just going cold turkey will kill you. Of course we all know how bad a needle habit can get too so it\u2019s pretty much a tie right? They can both easily claim your life", "2566": "I look at it this way, alcohol and benzo withdrawals can literally kill you. If you are dependent enough on alcohol it is very easy to seize up and die if you quit cold Turkey. A medical detox is necessary for a hardcore alcoholic. That being said, I've seen people in withdrawal from both. I've never personally withdrawn from alcohol. Everybody's miserable. Everybody hates life.

Of course opiate OD can too, and then there's the fentanyl issue.  \n\nKratom is a decent alternative to both.", "2569": "I think it depends. Are you talking physically, socially, mentally etc.?\n\nThey're both horrible imo. Both withdrawals are horrendous, but alcohol wds can kill you. It's also readily availavle everywhere and legal, making it impossible to avoid triggers. Long-term drinking causes a litany of serious health issues like liver damage. Opiates can also cause health issues depending on your drug and ROA, vein damage, abscesses, etc. You're also more likely to die from accidental overdose from opiates, especially if buying pills or dope on the street.\n\nSo both have terrible downsides. I think the biggest difference to me is what many opiate addicts (not all) do to get their drugs. Of course there's homeless alcoholics spending their only change on booze, or an alcoholic loses their job due to drinking and goes to the liquor store everyday, but it typically doesn't financially destroy you and it's legal. With dope/street pills being illegal and relatively expensive, you get more opiate addicts inevitably getting arrested, having expensive court costs, not working due to felonies (or needing to spend all day getting money/drugs), completely ruining themselves financially, stealing, prostituting, etc. I think more crimes are committed in the pursuit of opiates.\n\nSo I think opiate addiction is sometimes worse because I've seen it fuck more people's lives up in a HUGE way.

He started going into withdrawal in his cell and had a seizure. Unfortunately, when he seized, he fell and his head hit the concrete floor.

Drinking and buying alcohol is legal while dope isn't. Alcoholics can lose their jobs, get DUIs, like you said, both can fuck your life up. But I have not seen as many alcoholics completely ruined financially or doing the things some addicts do to get dope.\n\nIt's illegal to even buy dope and dope/pills can be expensive when your habit grows. Inevitably many addicts get arrested, get felonies, have court costs, lose their jobs, run out of money, and need to come up with $80+ a day rather then $10 or $20. Many end up not even paying their bills, getting payday loans, shoplifting, stealing, scamming, pawning shit, prostituting etc.\n\nObviously both are horrible and can ruin your life, I just disagree that opiates have more \"inward\" consequences than outward. I've seen many downward spirals (my own included) with consequences that just completely decimate people's lives.", "2584": "Agree 100%.

It takes will power & you gotta want to be sober but going cold turkey even, is just like ripping the bandaid off quicker because unfortunately, we all have to pay the piper at one time or another. \n\nBut tapering can make the process a lot more comfortable. But I\u2019d say that takes a lot more willpower than going cold turkey. Cause you\u2019ll still be dosing & looking at the pills every day, craving more. A majority of people cave, but not every one does. \n\nIf you are able to get you hands on suboxone, I highly suggest switching over to sub. Just use the smallest dose possible to be comfortable, DO NOT use suboxone to get high. If you venture down that path, the w/d\u2019s from suboxone are even worse than heroin/fent.\nJust use the subs for 5-10 days, while obviously tapering the dosage in half or fourths every 2 or 3 days. \n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I did after a year long binge with various different kinds of heroin. Went thru prob 9g BTH, probably 40g-60g of ecp, & a solid 25g-30g of china white that was def fent laced. Started with 2mg or 4mg of suboxone to start I believe. That was the perfect dosage to where I wouldn\u2019t be deathly sick & def not high, I would even be able to go to work. 3 or 4 days of 4mg then after that it was another 3 or 4 days of 2mg. If you can\u2019t handle that big of a \u201cdose jump\u201d, then just drop 1mg every 3-4 days. Suboxone is a life saver if you ask me. Helped me get thru the first week or withdrawals at least 4 separate times. Then I slowly drop the subs and then usually stay sober for a couple months or so & hen usually binge again.

I have the institution manual if you'd like me to take a pic and upload it somewhere if that would be helpful.\n\n>So my question is: how much respiratory depression is too much?\n\nI don't think this can be answered definitively beyond saying \"so much that they're not breathing\", because respiratory depression is only one symptom of an opiate overdose. Obviously no one wants to be narcaned or narcan a friend, but given the nature of opioid overdose there is a chance of brain damage, so better safe than sorry I say. If you genuinely can't rouse them or get any kind of response and their breathing is very slow or irregular, stopping and starting, then they're in danger and need medical attention.\n\nAlso, I was told it is safe to administer naloxone to anyone experiencing these symptoms, so if you see someone on the street unresponsive and with shallow or irregular breathing and pinned pupils then it's safe to administer naloxone (for them, not necessarily you, be safe!). Obviously call an ambulance and stuff too but it won't make the situation worse, but it could make it better, was the gist of what I was told. But keep in mind I'm not a doctor, just reading from the instructions given to me."}]}], "t3_d9cqt5": [{"0_title": "should i bother tapering off oxy or just get high and then switch to kratom ?", "comments": [{"2209": "whats ur daily amount right now?\n\nyoull wish u tapered .. i always do", "2210": "If that's all you've got left I would just enjoy it.

Heroin is cheaper and way easier to source.\n\nAs to why the underworld produces heroin instead of another opioid is because heroin is semi-synthetic, opium is taken from the poppy, morphine is isolated from the opium, and the morphine is converted to diacetyl (heroin) without the need for an advanced lab set up and chemicals, its the most potent easiest thing to make from the poppy besides if they just stopped at morphine (but converting to heroin makes it far more potent and a more desirable high).\n\nAs", "1884": "I personally think its portrayed as the king of opioids because:\n\n* It gives a good rush through all ROA's especially IV.

There's nothing wrong with experimenting with 29 gauge syringes, you may find those easier believe it or not, with big juicy veins anyway.", "1713": "It depends if it\u2019s too scarred, your body will make a new vein diverting it.

What\u2019s the best way to draw up?\n\n1) For some reason when I draw up into the syringe, there\u2019s always air I accidentally draw up towards the back of the syringe. And this makes it so when I try and inject, I can\u2019t create another air bubble to check for blood on the other side. How can I avoid this?\n\n2) Do you just poke INTO the cotton and draw? Or THROUGH it?\n\n3) How big should the cotton be? Should it absorb all of the solution or is it okay if it absorbs most and there\u2019s still some in the spoon? I\u2019ve been using cottons the size of like a pea. I notice when I\u2019m done the cotton is still dark like I didn\u2019t draw everything up \u2014 or is this normal?", "1717": "Thanks. Do veins eventually reappear and come back after you fucked them up too much? My main spot (crook of elbow) is scarred now and I can barely see or feel the vein now :/ \n\nWill I ever be able to inject there again if I give it time to heal?", "1718": "Thank you again! I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong still. I see the needle go right into the vein, pull back on the plunger... no blood unless I poke around.

Doesn't sound like you've done enough damage for it to disappear for good (yet).\n\n\nEdit: there are plenty of good veins to be found btw in your bicep, to both sides of the crook of your elbow, and on the top part of the forearm. These are the easiest to find and to hit successfully imo. Find 3 or 4 and rotate them regular. You won't regret it.", "1721": "Make sure to push the plunger in slow. Sometimes the pressure of pushing fast will pop the needle out of the vein. Also it can blow you vein out too which is no good. Just takes practice.  There were days where I\u2019d cook up a shot and get it in the first hit. Then there were days where it could take up to ten times. But if you try for hours at a time, best to maybe plug lol", "1722": "How do you use the belt? Is it as straight forward as I\u2019m thinkin\u2019?", "1723": "I just switched from snorting to IV less than a month ago.

Ive never known somebody who preferred the smaller barrel, never.", "1726": "Right on. I usually only need / use 40 or so units of water. That\u2019s still fine with 100 unit rigs right? Or should I be using more water for say like a tenth or two in a shot? Thanks!", "1727": "That's the right amount of water. Just get the 100 unit, doesn't matter if you only use 40 units of water. Trust me on this one. I'm pretty sure there are ZERO junkies who prefer the smaller barrel. Everybody I have ever know will curse the smaller ones if for some reason they are forced to use one. There is a big difference, and to be honest I can't tell you exactly why. Trust me here and spend the couple bucks to get the 100 unit rigs, or go to your local exchange and ask for them specifically. You won't regret it, and you won't ever go back to the 50 unit rig. Hopefully it helps you solve your problems registering as well. It will be easier though regardless. I promise.", "1728": "Thank you so much. Think switching gauges would help as well? I\u2019m using 31s.", "1729": "If you have big veins, then it's very possible you will prefer the 29 gauge. If you have small veins, or are injecting into your hands, feet, wrist, forearm, then 31g will be better 99% of the time. Since you've been shooting for a month..

Dehumanization is the gateway abhorrent human evil, people dehumanize others before they do things like lynching black people, gassing Jewish people, so... yeah...\n\nSecond I'm going say they are weak, weak willed, weak arguments, weak everything. They have been totally conditioned by anti-drug propaganda (weak critical thinking skills), they are filled with hate, due to ignorance, they can't form a valid argument (their cognitive minds are weak).\n\nThird. They lack moral fortitude, integrity, basic decency etc. So, when you guys are disagreeing on the cutest age range of kittens, they *creep* into your history and try to hurt you with something from your life that they know many people find painful.\n\nFourth, they're dumb. Tending not to be bright people at all - based on my experience that's a noticeable trait and not a just a baseless insult. I genuinely believe they have a below average intelligence, but also very sub-normal emotional intelligence.\n\nI could go on and on, but it is common, it is sad, humanity can cause many a sigh, many a rolled eyeball, but I'd trade a heroin addiction that I can overcome than being stuck as somebody that stupid, disgusting, creepy, that mean spirited and soulless.

If they call on you or ask if you want to share, it's perfectly acceptable to just say \"I'm new here and would just like to listen tonight, thanks\".

I sniffed oc oxys starting in the mid 2000s then opanas then dope then iv dope. When i am going to a doctor to get a script for subs, does that somehow make me not an addict while im taking my sub script? Somehow going from buying pills and dope to paying a doctor hundreds for a script of subs or methadone would change you from an addict into just dependent by your logic?  There is no difference imom\n\nSure you get your dope from a pharmacy but ive met so many people that got hurt bad, got on cpp, then out of nowhere they get cut off.  What would you do if you took your last pill, went to your doctor appointment and either the place was closed with a paper on the door saying \"the doctor got arrested/shut down and sorry for the inconvenience\", or you get inside into a room and the doc comes in and says \"sorry. Heres the numbers for the local methadone clinic. Good luck\" ? \n\nWould you just shrug your shoulders and go home with no meds and be fine with nothing or maybe spend weeks trying to get into another cpp doctor, only to get in and he says hell give you tramadol or 3- 5mg hydrocodone per day?  Youd be sick as fuck for a week then feel like garbage with no energy for months and months without a script\n\nThe last detox i was at there was a ~40year old woman that was in a bad car crash and had full dentures from knocking her teeth out. She got oxy 30s for a long time then out of nowhere the doc gives her the numbers for methadone clinics so she ended up doin dope.\n\nSure opiates work for pain at first, but with longer use at the same dose, all it does is make you feel normal. Now im not trying to put oxy users down, but even with way stronger opiates like opana and heroin dope, after 20 years theres increasingly diminished effects that i could shoot 2 grams of good dope and id still get better pain relief from tylenol/motrin. My tolerance back in 2010 was 40mg opana per day sniffed and one day i was sick and my friends mom had a few bottles of perk5s unused so i took 16 of em and it didnt even stop the wds and that was a decade ago. I just cant see anyone legitimately taking ~100mg of oxycodone per day for 5-10-20+ years and still be affected by that same dose. After a few months of the same dose all it does is get you dope sick wothout it and when you take it all it does is make you feel unsick.\n\nI guess if it makes you feel better to think youre different cause you get it from a pharmacy then go ahead and keep thinking that way, but you said you already take extra doses to feel good so just that already means you like the high from opiates and that your prescribed dose doesnt do much for you anymore.

I also work with clients who are on pain management regiments and focus on helping them manage their pain, depression, anxiety, and cravings to maintain a quality of life. Please keep this in mind as well, opiates decrease our tolerance for pain. Meaning, when we take opiates for a long period of time, what may have been a 5 on a pain scale before the opiates could feel like a 9 while having been on opiates for some time.

They actually make it worse. Your body develops a tolerance by making more opiate receptors in the Brain to handle more n more opiates, then when you don't have that same dose you now are more sensitive to pain.\n\nOpiates change our brain. We will rationalize to make it ok to do the drug.   So basically if you take 80mg oxycontin twice a day, eventually you'll stop feeling That same 80mg dose.\n\n  Now obviously if every day you wake up and take an 80mg oxycontin at 8am then 8pm every day, you'll wake up feeling a little bit dopesick, then take the 80oxy, youre going to feel better.  But instead of getting high you just go from sick(negative high) to feeling normal like ur basically just sober and then you would need to start taking more than 80mg to get the high.  And obviously this isnt scientific, its just a very simple explanation of how taking the same dose eventually just gets you to normal and youd then need to take over 80mg to start getting high from it"}]}], "t3_dbkbrf": [{"0_title": "Found a 30mg oxy in my bathroom!

What was your experience", "comments": [{"1197": "I used to donate plasma at OctaPpasma all the time, and it was usually a pleasant enough experience. The only thing that I didnt like was when they were busy and I had to wait forever till it was my turn, because the actual process took about an hour too. \n\nThey dont drug test you, but you do get a little physical when you first sign up. The first time you donate they send your blood to a lab to test for HIV and a few other things. They also check your vitals everytime and check your plasma levels before hand and if you're too low they tell you to come back the next day. Some people like to go to different places to try to get more money because they only let you donate 2 times a week. They do have you show your arms during the vital check every time and they look for track marks, so if you shoot and have marks they might turn you away. They have a little kiosk with a touch screen computer that you answer the same 20 something questions every time you go. They ask things like if you have been sick since the last visit, been out if the country, gotten a tattoo, paid for sex, live with someone that has HIV, hepatitis, things like that.\n\nThe process isnt too bad. I dont shoot up, but I dont really have a problem with the big ass needle they use. It just takes a while because they take your blood, it runs in a machine that separates the red cells from the plasma, then it sends your red cells back into your arm. It does this probably 5 or six times until the bottle is full of plasma, then there's a bag of saline that it pushes into your vein to kind of rehydrate your blood since they took all that plasma out. Like I said the process takes about an hour. Yoire sitting/laying in a comfy chair thing so you're comfortable. They have TVs and wifi. You're allowed to watch stuff and text on your phone, you just cant talk on your phone. \n\nThe money is decent too. At the place I went to you get $75 for your first donation. After that they have a system where you get $25 on your first visit of the week and $50 on your second. Plus they always have special promotions going on. It's either an extra $20 for your 2nd donation of the week. Or they base it on your total donations for the month and you can only do 8 a month since its max 2x a week. Like an extra $25 on your 6th, $30 on your 7th, and $50 on your 8th. Its Definitely worth it of you have nothing else to do and have spare time. You're also helping to save lives and create new medicines. \n\nUnfortunately they dont give you cash. They give you a prepaid debit card that you have to use and keep track of because they reload the same card everytime you donate. Once the guy in the back scans your plasma bottle the money gets put in your account. It was usually on there by 30 mins after I was done. The card isnt too bad because you can get cash back with it. I would go to publix and buy a soda then get the rest of the $ in cash back since you can pick exact amounts of cash back at publix. \n\nSorry for the book I just wrote. Lol.

It's no way to properly make a blue with fent in your house but people do it anyways. And everyone in this thread knows that and continue to put their life at risk. Anyone who dies from this shit I feel for I really do because I know it isn't easy to quit. But they know the possibilities of buying fake pills that are pressed. They also know they dont wanna feel dope sick when they cant get their clean pills so they'll be okay buying a fake one because hey maybe it will work and you won't die  but I'd rather not take the risk as it seems stupid.

I nearly lost her to this shit, this time. And I can't lose her... She is everything to me and so much more worth than this devil!

And in my defense, this gear is helping my back right now, so I can do shit until, hopefully, the scan letter comes from the hospital. I'm glad you found another reason to quit, other than yourself! When I see these posts about just doing it for yourself, I always think it's more healthy to have other reasons too! Because they become the gaols that some people can't think about while they're detoxing! And I really hope you get back with her, dude!

I tried to smoke it a few months ago, and fuck...!! Weed has been engineered to be so much more potent than I ever remember... I ended up in the hospital, tripping balls and not breathing properly... needless to say, I won't be touching that again, ahaha! I shouldn't even be smoking gear, as 2 years ago, just before Christmas, I run the lighter too close to the foil and blew half of my lung due to the heat! Apparently, lungs are like pockets of grapes, my left lung now is half grape and half tennis ball. Been told not to go scuba diving as the pressure could pop the tennis ball area and cause my lung to rupture/collapse... I also need to stop the cigarettes too. Been smoking for 22 years now, with a 2 month gap back in 2010 after a mini-stroke I had \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd I love that feeling!! The feeling of being clean which comes with that feeling of actually being awake for the first time in... Fuck knows how long!! Its like you've been emotionally disconnected through all the using. You don't notice at the time, as when you're using, you're just numb to everything and think that's 'normal'... But finally waking up! Fuck, I love that feeling!! Its so much better than the high from H, a thousand times better! Awake, a clear head and the energy to even feel just a little motivated... I want that soooooo bad! That and the thought of my Mrs wanting to stay with me... Nothing could ever ruin that, which is why I know I'm going to be free of this shit very, VERY soon.\n\nAnd I know that feeling only too well!! My Mrs is the same, she won't try to mould me in to the person she wants to be with, she takes me for me and loves me all the same. Which in turn, just makes me want to be a better person for her, to be the person she deserves! Because all the lies and shit that I've fed her these last few months... She deserves sooo much more than that and so much more. I don't think I'll ever be able to say \"that's enough, I've repaid her to what she deserves\", because she'll always be worth more than anyone could give! And you're right! Theres a very big difference! \n\nAlso, I know my Mrs. Loves me, even through all the shit I've put her through. Our first date... I met her on PlentyOfFish(don't know if you have that over there, it's a dating site). We talked on the phone and Skype for a few months. I finally took the dive and drove for an hour and a half to meet her. Our first date consisted of us just chatting shit in her living room, getting a dominoes pizza, 2 beers each... Then we fell asleep on her sofa while having a cuddle and still chatting shit! ahaha!! \ud83d\ude02 in my eyes, it's the best date I've ever been on or heard of, lol.

I have a prescription, I have a serious illness. And when I say serious I mean terminal. And it was hard for me to get them at 1st. That's partially because a lot of people are going in and asking for it when it's not really \"medically necessary\". But I do believe they're telling the truth when they rate their pain.

And you're absolutely right. What made it even easier to turn down is that somehow, by the grace of the Universe, I have avoided ever catching a charge throughout all my years of using, selling, etc which is literally a miracle considering I have done some really grimey shit in and have ran lots of hustles in the past. I've also gotten SUPER close to getting hemmed up on multiple occasions but somehow always was able to walk between the raindrops. I shared several of my close-call stories on here in the past but recently nuked my comment history so they are all gone.\n\nIt made it easy to turn it down when weighing the consequences of potentially risking my clean record and entering the system at 31 years old. I have seen soooo many of my friends struggle with serving jail/prison time, being stuck in the system, difficulties with finding employment and/or a place to live, thousands of dollars in fees and court costs, etc\n\nI'm too old for that shit lol", "276": "no doubt that i made the right choice and i'd probably be sitting in jail right now had i decided to get back into the game.\n\nyou are right about the stress, i have sold H in the past on a smaller scale as well and it was extremely stressful. there are so many factors that make it stressful and so many things to worry about from running the business in general, to sketchy customers, potentially being arrested or robbed, having someone OD on your product and it be traced back to you, making sure u don't run out of product and get sick, etc the list goes on and on.\n\nthroughout my career as a full-time dealer, i've had several different situations where i had some sort of law enforcement agency up my ass... from the local police, to the DEA, to the FBI (twice) although the FBI weren't really up my ass, they were investigating a close associate of mine both times, one time it probably wasn't that big of a deal but the other time, i'm certain they were watching me to some extent because i was the main supplier for a particular piece of contraband (not drugs) that my friend got caught committing felonies with. i've been on their radar since i was in high school though as well, so it's not that surprising. i remember coming home from a friend's house one day, when i was 17, and my Dad freaked out on me, screaming and yelling at me, because our neighbor told him that they saw an undercover cop across the street by their house sitting in their car, surveilling and taking pictures of our house.\n\nas far as drug-related, one of my customers got caught with a gram of dope on him right after i served him and he was on probation, so they tried to get him to cooperate and perform a couple of controlled buys on me in exchange for sweeping his probation violation under the rug. he randomly hit me up 2 weeks later after i served him that day and told me he just got out of jail and he told what they tried to get him to do. i was honestly surprised cuz this dude wasn't really a close friend or anything, more of an acquaintance that i worked with at one point.\n\ni've also been into hacking and cybercrime since i was a young kid (11 yrs old or so) and have ran a lot of rackets online in the past, and while i have always had pretty good opsec, i know for a fact that my activities did not go unnoticed and that i was probably on a list somewhere at some point. at one point, a server that i was operating from got seized by the Secret Service lol i still have the article somewhere from that one.\n\nthe things i've described in the post aren't even half of the times i've suspected that i was under investigation or came really close to getting completely fucked, probably for a very long time lol thankfully i've put all of that in the past and don't have to live looking back over my shoulders constantly...\n\nbut yes, my friend was ridiculously \"loud\" and kinda had that \"i'm scarface and untouchable\" type of attitude. he was notoriously sloppy and uncareful when it came to keeping a low-key profile. among the many, many things he did that were careless and irresponsible, one example is that he was almost always driving around, unnecessarily, with a life sentence in his car. i'm talking a bag with 5+ ounces of dope, an ounce of crystal or coke, ounce of molly, scales, bags, paraphernalia like pipes and rigs, large amounts of cash, weapons, etc. the only thing he was missing was a body in the trunk, and, he was on probation so they could search without probable cause. for a while, he wasn't even supposed to be driving cuz he had absconded on probation, so if they pulled him over and ran his name, he was done for. but he would drive around like this, all to deliver a couple grams of dope when he had a perfectly safe home to store all this illegal product at instead of only taking the absolute bare minimum needed so that he wasn't riding dirty. he would also regularly post up in sketchy places like random parking lots at 3am with all of this on him to get high. it stressed me out SO MUCH to hang out with him once he started behaving like this, which he didn't always act like this, only once the power got to his head did he start acting so careless.\n\nso yeah, when he proposed for me to join him, i immediately knew that there was no way i was going to accept because we operated completely different and would have had many differences when it came to how we operated. i valued my freedom and there is a reason that i was able to do it so long without catching a single charge. i took the absolute bare minimum risk and took every precaution possible, always had a plan and then backup plan, and because of that i narrowly avoided getting hemmed up several, several times.\n\na while back, he told me that two of his runners got setup and picked up by the DEA or drug task force or something of that nature and one of them was a spineless, huge piece of shit who, without a doubt, rolled over and snitched the second they gave him the opportunity to. so he was already probably being watched and investigated and he ended up committing a Felony Evading Police when they tried to pull him over, but there is a no chase policy where i live so they didn't get him that night and he got away but a couple of weeks later the SWAT team rolled up on him at like 5am and arrested him at this house for running that one night, among other things i am sure... and i probably would have went down with him that night as well cuz i'm sure i would have been with him at his house.\n\ndamn, i didn't mean to type that much... sorry for the novel lmao", "277": "Lmao what about what I said is soooo unbelievable? \n\nI'm pretty sure if I was trying to look cool I would have changed a lot of parts of my story instead of basically admitting that I decided to choose the boring, square life instead of the exciting, dangerous life of a successful

Basically, life is worth living again with benzos alone but mixed with lope, its a sure thing.\n\nFood/Drink and Nicotine - Basically, after you eat a lot of food you tend to get sleepy and when in WD, sleep is hard to come by. If I'm allowed to sleep whenever I want throughout the day (like on the weekend) the second I feel remotely sleepy, I go to bed. \n\nI can increase the success rate for this by timing my eating and drinking along with any form of nicotine.

So a given pill could have something like 28mg up to 32mg. I forget the allowable percentage of variation...not sure about he 2% but nonetheless, once I found out about it then it was feasible that one brand might have more oxy per pill than another.
