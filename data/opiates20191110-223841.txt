0,Anyone ever tried to grow their own opium poppies?,"Yeah I tried, I had gotten a huge pack of unwashed seeds from amazon to make myself some tea with, which I ended up not having the patience for so I did a cwe type deal and had all the seeds left over, so I said fuck it might as well try and plant em and see what’s up. So I did, and they fuckin sprouted too!! I was so excited up until my asshole neighbor decided to toss some scrap wood and branches over his fence and crushed all my little budding poppies! Granted this area was like a common area not my own yard (for obvious reasons and just to be safe) so it was entirely possible they wouldn’t make it anyway, but none the less saddening!"

2,Anyone ever tried to grow their own opium poppies?,"I've grown some Papaver Rhoeas in my mum's garden. They're really easy to look after and pretty to look at. I don't know how different Somniferum is, but I don't think they'd be much different. I live in England near London and planted them end of July. They did go a bit brown on the leaves and red in the stems and look quite unwell for a while but they picked up and started flowering a few months ago. Still getting flowers :)

btw not all opium poppies produce much opium, the idea that anything labelled Somniferum will have a high opium content isn't the case I think, you'll want to confirm the seeds are potent if you're growing them for that purpose."

11,How do I shoot g73?,"What you need:

* 91% isopropyl alcohol, must be 91% or higher

* 2 cookers, I use the bottom of pop cans

Steps:

* Remove coating with damp paper towel, don't use spit.

* Crush the pill to a fine powder.

* Put desired amount of shot in first cooker, add 3mL (full syringe is usually 1mL, which is the same as 1CC) or so of 91% iso, mix this shit up and let it sit for a couple mins

* Use a cotton and suck up all of the iso/drug liquid. An oral syringe works the best for this step.

* Squirt the iso/drug liquid into second cooker, the more surface area the faster it evaps. Some people burn it off, I do not and don't recommend it.

* Once it is totally evaporated add desired amount of water to cooker that has the dried thin layer of now pure oxymorphone and filter it through cotton once again to be safe.

* Inject

----

This is probably not the safest thing in the world to do, but it is better than a lot of other shit that people do when shooting pills. Remember that 91% iso is very flammable."

13,I was wondering how it just evaporated without burning it off; you probably don’t recommend because it’s super flammable but how else,"You can use indirect very careful heat to speed it up.

50,What do you guys think? Using while inducting on subs.,"Ideally you should just use the buprenorphine. I have no idea how taking other opiates will effect the induction process, but if I had to guess I would say it shouldn't have too much of an effect and the buprenorphine will still build up and your body still adjust to it. But when you stop using the other opiates you will still likely be faced with feeling worse, so it's probably better to try to ride it out and only take what you really need for sleep etc. It really can suck I know but after a while it will level out and you'll feel alright.

Not a doctor so I cant say one way or another what effect using on top will have overall, but in my experience you can take opiates on top of buprenorphine to help with the less-pleasant effects the buprenorphine can have when you're not on a stable dose and adjusting to it. But whether that will just prolong the induction process or somehow interfere with it, I don't know, I've only done it a few times and even then I'm only one person.

Also without wanting to sound preachy using on top isn't going to help with breaking the mental addiction. In my experience part of the benefit of using buprenorphine is dosing once a day and not looking for those hits.

Hope you start feeling a little better soon. Good luck."

Hope you start feeling a little better soon. Good luck.","Thank you for replying! Exactly, it has made the process much smoother. And I have been using very minimally like you suggest. Not trying to get high. It definitely doesn't help with the mental addiction. But like I said I'll try to stop the dope tomorrow and see how it goes. I should be getting stable soon. But that's my concern as well, if I'll still have some kind of withdrawal from the dope being that I've still been using? I shouldn't have done it today even being that I felt decent. But its hard. And its getting late and I was worried I wouldn't sleep because I work early tomorrow morning."

And its getting late and I was worried I wouldn't sleep because I work early tomorrow morning.","Hopefully your body will adjust and the subs will build up to a point where you don't feel too rough. I've been struggling myself to take buprenorphine properly, and even switching from snorting it to taking it properly sublingually every day there's a period of feeling like crap until you adjust. It is hard. Buprenorphine is a funny drug, it can be a pain to get on, it's a strange sensation like mini-withdrawals, I'm guessing because it has such a high binding affinity it replaces your endorphins in the same way it would any other opiate, leading to the leg and back acheyness and general withdrawal-like symptoms. The lack of sleep is the worst for me. I can deal with it knowing I can sleep and have my morning subs soon, but when it's 11pm and you know you're not sleeping and you feel like crap it's awful knowing you still have to wait 6 or 7 hours until you can get any relief.

Still, it's just a matter of sticking it out and adjusting. Easier said than done I know, but it's worth it in my opinion.

Like I said I've used on top in the past and it definitely helps, I'm just not sure if like you said when you stop using on top you'll have mini withdrawals from that. I'd expect to feel a bit rougher but I doubt it'll be too bad. If you have anything that might help you sleep I'd recommend using that and trying to sleep before using on top, that's what I tend to do if I'm feeling tempted, though it doesn't always work. I have some quetiapine that I use rarely for this, but a drowsy anti-histamine or something similar could help. Obviously be careful not to take something too strong, buprenorphine is nowhere near as bad as other opiates for respiratory depression but it's still worth considering.

Hope things improve soon, you got this!"

54,What started you on opiates?,I had surgery and was given 20x 10mg Oxys and they were the best thing ever.  Now there is no where for me to get them and it kills me inside.
55,What started you on opiates?,"My friend gave me two percocet 5mg pills and I was high all evening, night, and in to the morning. Never felt so good in all my life."
56,"My friend gave me two percocet 5mg pills and I was high all evening, night, and in to the morning. Never felt so good in all my life.","It started when my mom gave me a bottle of vicodin 5s she didn't want. 

I took one half, then a half everyday then a whole pill everyday, then my twin gave me percocet and I ate all of those. When I could not get them anymore I was so devastated. 

Then I got severe rheumatoid arthritis and now I get opioids all the time, hard ones like fentanyl. All drugs should be legalized period."
57,What started you on opiates?,"Ironically, D.A.R.E. And how they said weed was a gateway drug. It really was a gateway drug for me; the first time I tried pot I realized everything I was ‘taught’ via scare tactics was utter bullshit, so I decided to try all the drugs, and eventually found my way towards opiates. Vicodin was what led me down the path to harder opiates if I recall correctly."
58,What started you on opiates?,"I got into a car wreck and was given a prescription for Percocet . Then my dr refilled it twice. So about a month on Percocet got me hooked. Had terrible withdrawals if I didn’t have anything. I stayed on pills for about a  year and a half and then switched to snorting heroin. Went to a methadone clinic to get off heroin. And now I’ve been off that for about a week. It’s a bitch trying to get off but I’ve been opiate free for a week! Longest I’ve been clean in 3 years.

Edited to add: Before my car wreck I was not on drugs. I don’t even smoke weed. I had major surgery in 2011 and didn’t even fill the opiate prescription then. I was in a ton of pain and figured the pain meds would help this time. They did. But now I wish I never touched them. I wish my dr would of paid attention and never refilled my prescription."
59,What started you on opiates?,Stole 6 pink 10 mgs from my grandpa. Continued to steal them every time he had them. Only saw him every 2 weeks or so. But eventually Got a job and personal dealer's. Been struggling ever since
60,What started you on opiates?,I started out with Heroin because I was super depressed and suicidal and it made me not want to kill myself.
61,What started you on opiates?,"back when i was about 17 oxycontin flooded my area. drugs were always a problem in california. especially in rougher areas. but oxycontin just exploded on the scene. mainly because old people were getting prescribed it like candy and they were realizing this was a great way to supplement their income. i moved away from my home town to another state to attend college. this was a wealthier more suburban area. oxycontin etc was difficult to find because college kids simply weren't really doing that. BUT at the time suburban doctors would write you prescriptions for opiate based cough syrup for the most minor coughs. they were being told to prescribe this stuff by pharma reps of course. i remember my doctor had Tussionex pens (a brand of opiate cough syrup). there were so many cheap cheap generic hydrocodone based syrups that it's hard to remember them all. what people started doing was seeing campus doctors or personal doctors and then selling the syrup at high prices. my doctor at the time would write me entire pints for histinex? which was a generic for tussionex. of course it was very easy to get the purple stuff all the rappers talk about too. but that was usually a bummer to get because it was only codeine. i found myself feeling sick after drinking syrup/popping pills etc every single day for months on end. so yea basically just doctors and people trying to capitalize off of their own scripts. i was around and using for what would become the perfect storm that we now know as the opioid epidemic. things have changed dramatically and kids are willing to get high off strange powders and liquids from china etc. but it's all the same. people feel like they don't have a place in this world. they feel depressed they feel lonely they feel like they can't truly connect with others. they will turn to things to immediately relieve the misery they feel. maybe if we lived in a world that didn't vilify drug addicts and celebrate doctors. we would have a chance at tackling this problem at it's source. but yea big pharma got us addicted to their products. most of us would have never tried them if they weren't so incredibly easy to get. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR i was sold my first Oxycontin 80 pill at my own highschool in my senior year. doctors used to write scripts for opiates just because they basically needed to. basically most people my age were introduced to opiates by a doctor or someone trying to supplement their income off pills a doctor over prescribed them. tbh a lot of the people with scripts back then probably didn't really truly need them."

63,"Thanks for this, seems like what i’ve been reading has been true",thats definitely how it started. now we can thank our failure as a society for continuing it.
64,What started you on opiates?,"I was researching drugs and opioids sounded like a fun high. So I was dumb enough to ignore the slew of warnings and did them without knowing weather I was gonna get addicted or not. Fortunately I’m not. I make damn sure I do everything I can to not become addicted to anything at all not just opioids. It’s November now and I started back in March. Still not addicted thank the gods. The first one I did was codeine. I got a Tylenol 3 and snorted. I knew codeine was the weakling of the opioids so I wasn’t expecting to get high. To my surprise, I actually got a pretty good high off of it. That was back when the only drugs I’ve done were weed, shit quality cocaine, and K2. I’ve done a lot more since then. But the opioids I’ve done since the codeine are, tramadol, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and methadone. Methadone was the absolute best one. I took 10mg orally. That’s a common dose according to the psychonaut wiki so I was feeling it real good. Still got some oxy left so I might do that soon."
65,What started you on opiates?,"Broke my hip when I was 18 (25 now) and got put on vicodin for a month. Ended up looking for pills on the street after those were gone. Got out of rehab last November after switching to heroin/fent that last year I was using.

67,Detox?,"The ones I went to use methadone for a rapid 3 day taper. They also give stuff for anxiety and sleep meds if you want it. The one detox I went to was kind of boring just stay in your room/bed all day with a personal tv and an NA/AA meeting at night. There was also an art therapy thing one day. The other one was a detox in the same wing as their rehab so you could go to the groups that they were holding otherwise you’d just stay in your room, you couldn’t be in the lounge area while groups were going on"
68,Detox?,depends on where you go. wherever you decide to go. don't believe everything they tell you and do your own thorough research. typically they'll give you a suboxone or methadone taper with klonopin or valium. the one i went to last time did that for about a week. i got off of things pretty comfortably. i still experienced insomnia afer i was done with the taper. but it was mainly just really really boring. if you're smart you'll bring books and if you're lucky you'll have your own tv/room. everywhere is different. now detox that i've done in an actual medical setting like within a hospital wing. that has been very very comfortable. same medication used just better more personalized care and tons of personal space with your own tv that actually has decent channels. i liked it a lot.
69,Detox?,"The few detox clinics that I have been to have given lorazepam (ativan) , Clonidine, methocarbamol, immodium, promethazine, ibuprofen and benadryl for withdrawal.

Plus, it's nice sometimes to be with a group of people who are going through the same thing you are.

The last time I went to detox,  they offered acupuncture and massage!!  The massage was the best part of the whole process!!  Most places offer counseling as well as NA or AA meetings.. which,  is a good thing for folks in early recovery.   Give the medical  assistance  detox a shot! Also, do not be ashamed if you are unable to make it through  the  entire  process.  I went and left after day  3 so many times!!

If you are kicking heroin or oxy, I recommend using 3 to 5 days of methadone at a dose that makes you feel normal, same dose each day.

You can greatly reduce or even eliminate acute withdrawal symptoms that way.

102,Why does oxy make me happy?,"The short answer is that the oxy binds to opiate receptors in your brain, and signals for the release of dopamine into your system. Dopamine is the natural chemical in our bodies that makes us feel good. There are healthy things we do that cause dopamine release- exercise, sex, music, and eating for instance. Unfortunately, nothing floods our system with a massive amount of dopamine quite like opioids, so no, there are no other non-addictive ways to replicate that feeling.

That dopamine rush is opioids’ greatest gift and also its biggest curse. Stay safe, friend."

143,Way to fill a prescription without my doctor knowing?,"Nope, every state has prescription monitoring programs in place now"
144,"Nope, every state has prescription monitoring programs in place now",Absolutely right! Also the DEA will probably catch wind of this as well.
145,Way to fill a prescription without my doctor knowing?,"If you do this, there is a 100% chance you will be caught. Every state has an electronic prescription database and shares that info with other states (so you’d likely be caught even if going out of state). All health care providers (including your doctor) and pharmacies have access to this database, so they will know if you’re attempting to fill multiple/duplicate scripts. 

I know there is a temptation to try and cash in on the mistake, but this would be a terrible idea. You WILL get caught. At the very least you will be labeled a drug seeker and your doctor and pharmacist will cut off your scripts. At worst you could be charged with prescription fraud (a felony).

Fraud was easy to get away with 15 years ago before electronic databases, but it’s not an option anymore. Just throw the extra script in the trash... I know it hurts and you feel like you’re wasting an opportunity, but the alternative is going to be much, much, worse if you attempt to fill that extra script."
146,Way to fill a prescription without my doctor knowing?,"Not a single chance if your using insurance. You’ll be flagged immediately. Too soon to fill. And if you tell the pharmacy that you aren’t using insurance, they will 100% certainly check the PDMP. And then it’s likely that the pharmacist will call your doctor. And then it’s likely that your doctor will taper you or drop you as a patient completely. I wouldn’t even try. It’s just going to screw you over."

149,Way to fill a prescription without my doctor knowing?,"It can be done, I've actually done it, so it's not impossible. I'd not recommend doing it though. Also my younger brother copied and forged a hell of alot of methadone scripts and filled them at various pharmacies. And yes I know that with the prescription reports it should be impossible, but there are pharmacies that only check their companies reports. Again I'd not recommend doing it, my brother got busted, and not only kicked out of the dr.s practice but charges were filed."
150,Way to fill a prescription without my doctor knowing?,"If you fill without insurance (which can be expensive) and travel to specific states, it’s quasi possible (or was back like 3-4 years ago).  It’s expensive, a bitch and a half, and also paranoia inducing like a motherfuck."

Have fun, bro"
155,Can you mix ketamine with opioids?,"Yeah I’ve been prescribed gabapentin fir a long time then Lyrica for a long time.

175,How to remove atropine from diphenoxylate?,"I'm thinking you're talking about lomotil (unfortunately motofen, its stronger cousin is still almost impossible to find despite it being returned to the market after a ~decade long hiatus)

For some reason I've never been susceptible to the anti-muscarinic effects of atropine and can swallow 20 of the tiny bastards at a time when I've been forced to by withdrawals (or ultra-diarrhea) because of some snafu with my pain doctor like being unable to make an appointment.

Anyway! IIRC the two compounds have vastly different half-lives and durations of action, so staggering your doses can allow the atropine to be eliminated while the diphenoxylate continues to work.  In effect, you can take your max tolerable dose every ~1-2 hours and likely have minimal atropine-related side-effects.  Of course this will vary significantly by person, but the principle should remain - I do recommend easing into such a schedule in case the duration of action for atropine is longer than expected for you.

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on one's views) I have never needed to do any sort of extraction on these, but I likewise have never come across any mention of such a possibility either despite quite a long tenure on bluelight and drugforums both."

184,Different feelings on different opioids?,"Hydrocodone is awesome and far from weak. You just have to find the right dose. I actually like it almost as much as oxy. 

Codeine is cool in the relation to Vicodin (hydrocone) as in VI (6 in Roman numerals) and Codin (codeine) = 6 times stronger than Codeine mg to mg. So metabolism aside a Tylenol 3 is SUPPOSED to be 5mg of Hydrocodone.

Just a fun fact."

I normally only take 15mg oxy for a pretty decent buzz since I have no real tolerance. So, 10 mg more of hydro than what I’d take for oxy seems to be good for me for a mild high."
186,Different feelings on different opioids?,"Well, yes and no.  The main difference of course lies in relative potencies - and with that comes the issues of ROA as well as of codeine metabolism.  For most [white] people with the standard isoforms of the relevant liver enzymes, the conversion is 1:10 into morphine.

So now we're looking at morphine vs oxycodone vs hydrocodone.  They do have some differences in feeling for me, with the rough consensus running that oxycodone is stimulating compared to morphine and hydrocodone which have more of a pure depressant effect.  Due to codeine being a prodrug, it's onset is far slower and thus produces no ""rush"" (as minimal as it is via the oral route) while oxycodone has a rather fast and pronounced impact.  Likewise, there's somewhat of a ceiling effect with codeine simply due to the saturation of the enzymes necessary for conversion to the active morphine metabolite. Hydrocodone lies somewhere in the middle, though I can't comment much from personal experience as it is strangely ineffective for my own issues.  Supposedly it is more similar to codeine than oxycodone, with a much ""warmer"" body high and type of euphoria.  In contrast (as noted), oxycodone is more like taking hydrocodone along with some adderall...

Personally, I have found that 60mg of codeine, which should be roughly equivalent to 6mg morphine (and hence 6mg of hydrocodone - again via oral ROA) or ~4mg oxycodone, just really isn't.  Oxycodone is far more effective, but again, the need for codeine to be metabolized and first-pass-related effects distort the picture quite a bit, making direct comparison almost impossible aside from actual subjective 'testing'

Hope that helps!"

207,Anyone else awake and kickin?,"Depressed as fuck! But not going thru withdrawals cause there ain't shit to be found where I'm at. Just left my house and came to town cause, well its 4 amish and cant sleep with not one damn thing better to do. Hope you get over the rls soon whether it's a good or bad thing that takes care of it! I really font miss that part, when I couldn't get comfortable or sleep for more than a couple of hours for about 4 months!"
208,Anyone else awake and kickin?,Feel you. Thought I was over the worse of it. Got desperate last night and scraped a weed pipe for resin to get a hit or two. Got  about 4-5 good hours of sleep after a really long shitty week. My legs are killing me and I can’t shut my brain off tonight. I just want sleep.
209,Anyone else awake and kickin?,"Hi, guys--sorry you're w/ding.

I have unreal intermittent jaw pain that I've been suffering for the past year: I bit down hard with the right side of my teeth on a hard nutrition bar until my jaw gave way.

Since then, my right jaw starts killing me with pain, which then also gives me an ear ache and throat and strange neck pains. I'm going to an ear, nose, and throat guy soon.

Just this minute it has all quieted down--as long as I don't open my mouth. Paradoxically, when it's really killing me, to help quiet it down I have to open my mouth wide open, which hurts like hell, but helps a lot with the pain.

Man..."
210,Anyone else awake and kickin?,"I know how you feel. Im just reducing my morphine dose from about 600mg a day to 200mg. Its not complete withdrawal of course, but the only way i can sleep at night is when im doing the whole 200mg right before im going to bed. So from waking up until the evening im sweating like crazy, cant eat, cant even sit down for more than five minutes. 

Still, whatever your reasons are, keep going. It will be over soon enough. What are you kicking and how much where you doing if i can ask?"

I really hope I feel better tomorrow because I start a new job.

Goodluck on your taper!"
212,Does being on subs long term have an effect on how long after taking a sub you need to wait to dose opiates?,"subs (buprenorphine) does have a cumulative effect & build-up in your system, so you'd almost certainly find *some* blockade at 24hrs, probably even longer.  Here's a table showing the day-by-day build up, & time for that dose to effectively leave your system:

http://www.helpmegetoffdrugs.net/_images/16mgs-11day-37halflife.png

The table shows a stretch that's longer than my subjective experience, which is being able to feel something after 36hrs (depending on strength, etc)"
213,Does being on subs long term have an effect on how long after taking a sub you need to wait to dose opiates?,"Yes, it does due to residual buildup on your receptors and its long half life. The other commenter with the link probably explained better than i"
214,Does being on subs long term have an effect on how long after taking a sub you need to wait to dose opiates?,Just wait 24 hours after taking a opiate. With fent (street dope) I wait like 8 hours only

216,Is there a good way to ween off opiates?,"A taper will certainly attenuate the psychological and physical symptoms of opioid withdrawal, but whether you’ll be able to maintain your sobriety once you’ve detoxed, is a different kettle of fish. 

40mg of oxycodone or equivalent 3 times a week, isn’t likely to cause horrendous symptoms, but if you feel a taper will be beneficial and make you more comfortable, then go for it. It’s certainly less of a shock to the system so to speak. 

Or you could simply cold turkey and use non addictive medication to make the week of flu like symptoms, more manageable. 

Good luck."

218,Is there a good way to ween off opiates?,u only use 3 days a week and u feel wd?
219,u only use 3 days a week and u feel wd?,"It feels like withdrawal. I know it sounds weird, but I only use when the withdrawal symptoms start to come back."
220,Is there a good way to ween off opiates?,"The 5 days of detox is the easy part.  Its when you start to feel ""better"" at like a few weeks clean is when the real hard part comes. Your brain will be rationalizingthat its okay to use and the first month or two you'll have to fight it constantly.

And in my opinion tapering is just a waste of time. You spend weeks/months dropping your dose but its still gonna be 4-5 days of detoxing. 

 The way drugs get eliminated from our body is not linear. Like 1,000mg doesnt take 10x longer to get out than 100mg.  The way it works is the drugs half life. The 1000mg will go to 500 in one half life while the 100mg only drops to 50.

So basically sinceur only taking say 40mg a day, dropping to 20mg aint gonna make detox noticably easier. I think oxys half life is around 4 hours. Within 4 half lives (16 hours) the 40mg dose is gonna be barely higher level than a 20mg dose."
221,Is there a good way to ween off opiates?,"i find the easiest way to get off a small dose is to swap over to subutex for a few days

about half a milligram, once a day for about four days is generally sufficient to get the opiates out of my system without getting any sort of addiction to the subs and without getting any physical withdrawal symptoms"

From 5 mg I was going to take an eighth of a suboxone 16mg strip if I started feeling like crap. My biggest WD symptom is restless legs which leads to insomnia and a whole other list of issues in itself from lack of sleep lol

i find that the subs help still the legs a bit and valium can also help with the legs, my state of mind and sleep in general

you'll probably find that 2mg of sub will do you for 3-4 days, which will probably remove the need to top up if you take the whole 2mg"
224,Is there a good way to ween off opiates?,Btw there’s a methadone clinic right up the street that charges $10 a day which is definitely an option but I’ve heard horrible things about methadone so that’s look like like a last resort
225,Btw there’s a methadone clinic right up the street that charges $10 a day which is definitely an option but I’ve heard horrible things about methadone so that’s look like like a last resort,I wouldn't recommend switching to methadone but if you done keep your dose low and don't expect to get high from it only well I wouldn't suggest at the low dose of oxy your at methadone will be harder to get off of so remember that
226,Is there a good way to ween off opiates?,"I’d just CT it if I were you. Oxy was 5 days of shit at 100mg and then I was ok. Just be ready for 3 days of depression, except you aren’t using everyday so I think you’d be alright."

239,I shot a dirty cotton yesterday and now have have sudden hearing loss in my left ear... should I be worried?,"In a nutshell, yes. Yes I would be worried. 

I personally would toddle off to your GP for investigation. I’m not too sure you have an infection that has caused unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, but it CAN occur with opioid use due to physiological mechanisms that are beyond the scope of this reply. 

An infection seems unlikely as you don’t mention other symptoms. Just the sudden onset hearing loss. 

Time is generally of the essence though. 

Best of luck to you."

It can usually be treated with aggressive, high dose glucocorticoids.

But if it (hearing loss) came on basically after you did a shot, it’s not drawing too long a bow to connect the dots. I’d personally be honest and say you did a shot of opioids and were suddenly afflicted with hearing loss. Any doctor worth their salt would be aware of the mechanism behind this and how to treat it. 

Worst case you can always get a cochlear implant. 

It’s what happened to Rush Limbaugh and his penchant for the “oxycotton” caused his hearing loss."

253,Best way to make tar snortable?,"The only reason you can't snort tar is because of the added water weight, if you have real black tar heroin you just need to find a way to dry it at low heat.

It should all work just fine in reverse. Hopefully that made sense a little buzzed right now and that was a long time ago when I lived out in Cali.

286,How’s everyone’s Saturday night going?,"Pretty fuckin good, snorting a sharpie marker and playing “Ori” the video game, while listening to “dead wing dork” stream, it’s my creature comforts. Too old to party, way too stupid to behave like my age."

Don't even apply heat"
289,about 100mg of liquid morphine - too much?,i think going over 60 mg first time taking morphine is unwise. i think generally its good to start at around30-50 when you dont have much of a tolerance. if thats not enough you can always take more.
290,about 100mg of liquid morphine - too much?,I suggest plugging. Oral morphine sucks. As for dosage I have no clue. Look up opioid conversation calculators online and see how much morphine equals your methadone doses. I’d say starting around 40-60mgs would be good then go from there
291,Can heroin lose its magic?,It sounds like tolerance my friend.
292,It sounds like tolerance my friend.,If I take little I feel a bit better than I take loads. But still not as good as it was 2 weeks ago
293,If I take little I feel a bit better than I take loads. But still not as good as it was 2 weeks ago,"Yeah that's tolerance in a nutshell, when you start using it feels soooo fucking amazing but when you start using it more frequently you'll have to use larger doses to get that feeling you got when you first started and eventually you develop a physical dependency on it and need it to feel normal.

If you aren't physically addicted to it yet I'd stop and take a tolerance break for either a couple weeks or a month because tolerance is reversible luckily."
294,Can heroin lose its magic?,"Everything can will lose its magic. Think about sex with someone you find attractive, it’s going to get old. It’s tolerance, it’s novelty, a lot of it has to do with your setting in a familiar setting you aren’t going to feel it as much as a new setting."

296,Can heroin lose its magic?,"When i sniffed pills then sniffed dope, after awhile it just made me feel normal for the most part. Then i finally tried a shot of dope and was amazed at how good the rush feels from iv use. You just don't get it unless you shoot it. 

Even a decade later i still get a nice euphoric rush from a shot of dope. There is a reason we all eventually end up doin iv dope."
297,Hydro with heroin on pretty large tolerance?,I’d take all 7. I don’t use Percocet or Norcos much but usually 10 is the most I will eat before starting to CWE shit. A little over 3gs.

I rarely drink anything with apap and i never drink alcohol so my liver shouldn't be too bad. It'd be 2275mg of apap so that should be fine as long as it's a one time thing right? i mean it'd literally only be today as i don't really mess with these anymore.

Was scared for the next 2 weeks when I realized what I’d done but I ended up being fine thankfully. Why I tell you this is so you know with the amount you will be taking your chances of liver damage are like being hit with lightning."
300,Hydro with heroin on pretty large tolerance?,"It’ll give a good high if you combine them. Combined opioids for me usually enhance the high in many ways. I know some people feel like it’s a waste, but for me it adds an extra layer. Also you could save them for when you are withdrawaling. For 5 I wouldn’t CWE, but for 7 I would."

I had a few morphine ERs the other day and chewed them up and took them orally, since i don't shoot or have the equipment to boof, and that with the dope had me nodding like never before. It was heaviest and best nods i ever had. I took all 7. I figure 2.2g of apap wouldn't be too bad since it's a one time thing. Hopefully i get that nice hydro energy when i combine them."
302,Hydro with heroin on pretty large tolerance?,If you take all 7 of em you’d likely feel a good buzz. Personally I’d save them for a day when my plug was out to help me get through a day of withdrawal.

318,Lol,"It doesn’t seem that weird to me. One country in the Eurobond, but no others? It has a port and a Russian border, so it’s certainly not the only explanation, but with the population of a mid/large US city you have to imagine the number of big suppliers doesn’t have to be that great to serve what... 10-20k addicts? 





You’d think if everyone loved it, someone would have gotten the idea to move it further into Europe, and if they hated it, someone would have gotten the idea to jump down to Latvia and get some real H.





There has to be a reason. It’s not like fent just showed up in one US state and everyone else said, no thanks and it didn’t spread. And other than a greater language barrier, moving goods from one country to another within the EU is just as easy moving things between US. Why do you think it happened?"

327,In Ohio there are more than 70 opioid deaths per month.,"Yea, we arguably got hit the worst with the fent, here in Ohio. Top 3 would probably be Ohio, Maryland and Pennsylvania. It's been almost impossible to find real heroin here within the last several years and nobody even wants it anymore because their tolerance is all jacked from the fent and it's analogues. A couple years ago my lesser-known city took the cake for most OD's from B-town. Shits gotten a little better but that's just because everyone is tolerant to the shit."

334,"I mean I don't know a single addict in my generation that didn't start on oxy, myself included.",True.  Everyone I know started with a script from their doc. When I was younger some kids picked up heroin after just moving from drug to drug and then got hooked.  But I’d say 90% of people I know and have met in real life started with a surgery or using a friends pills.
335,"I mean I don't know a single addict in my generation that didn't start on oxy, myself included.",I wasn’t on anything when I picked up heroin. I’m likely a rare case but I never understood the appeal for 30+a pill.

I missed that wave, I was staying away from opioids for the most part all throughout my drug life before I tried heroin. I’d smoked some oxy with my friend a few years back and tried subs a few times way back as well but I knew I should just stay away. 

I think the cheapest id ever heard back in school was around 17 for 30mgs. Cheaper with ten or more type things. Once I was into heroin though they were generally going for 35 for 30mgs in my area. It just blows my mind."

Those numbers started falling in 2010 when the DEA wiped out most pill mills. The doctors being persecuted these days are mostly legitimate. I believe the real reason for the war on opioids is because rx pain killers are no longer profitable. But u know what is?? SUBOXONE. Now they're trying to put everyone on suboxone for things from addiction to chronic pain. And actually, about 90% of all prescribed painkillers go to chronic pain patients and only about 1% of that group ever becomes addicted to or abused their opioids. And they usually don't give their pills away because they need them to live. I should say we bc I fall into this group too. I also fall into the 1% but I'm doing a pretty good job of staying on top of myself lol. But I didn't start taking opioids for fun, it was for pain. And I was an addict long before I ever took my first pain pill. There's a whole group of people who are suffering because of the government's agenda. And with the scarcity of prescription opioids these days, our government is actually pushing more people towards illicit fentanyl."

453,can i mix tramadol and hydrocodone?,"As long as you dose in a manner commensurate with your opioid tolerance, then it’s perfectly safe to mix tramadol and hydrocodone. Good thinking about spacing the dosing out over an hour or so. You don’t want to saturate the enzyme that converts both into more active metabolites. 

While tramadol is a prodrug with no active Mu agonist activity on its own until metabolised to desmethyltramadol by O-demethylation, hydrocodone does have intrinsic activity as an agonist. However it too is converted into a more active form. That form being hydromorphone. 

If you take too much at the same time, that process can encounter an enzymatic bottleneck and reduce the effects of both. 

Anyway, happy nods and all that jazz.

Oh as for the paracetamol, you want to keep it at or below 1000mg of paracetamol every 6 hours and no more than 4000mg in 24 hours. This is to prevent NAPQI mediated hepatotoxicity. Or you could perform a CWE and not have to worry, but it’s a pain in the ass and I personally couldn’t be bothered. So stick to the recommendations above to stay safe and enjoy a pleasing buzz. 

Given you only have 4 of the pills anyway, assuming you took all 4 at once, you’d be perfectly fine, even though that would put you *slightly* above the 1000mg threshold. But there is a fair bit of a safety margin built into the recommended doses, just to account for that statistically guaranteed idiot out there who thinks “If one is good, 3 must be better!”

Edit 1: To add paracetamol toxicity avoidance guideline

Edit 2: The “bad effects” such as it being an epileptogenic, are well known and extremely unlikely to manifest in people without a preexisting seizure disorder or at therapeutic doses. You’d be more likely to win lotto. 

200mg is highly unlikely to do anything other than give OP a mild opioid buzz."

455,can i mix tramadol and hydrocodone?,Bro it can cause seizures or increase your risk for ones if you mix tram with any other opiate I wouldn’t do this personally
456,Bro it can cause seizures or increase your risk for ones if you mix tram with any other opiate I wouldn’t do this personally,They literally prescribe them together
457,Bro it can cause seizures or increase your risk for ones if you mix tram with any other opiate I wouldn’t do this personally,"No, mixing it with another opiate is a great way using them recreationally and less likely to tive you seizurea because you take a smaller dose of tramadol as you are mixing it with another opiate to make it stronger. This is better than chasing the opiate feeoing by taking more tramadol alone.

However, its not recommended to mix tram with any SSRI's, DXM to avoid risk of serotonin syndrome and not to mix with stimulants or to take them when in any benzo/gabapentoid/alcohol/GHB withdrawal as your seizure threshold will be already lowered."
458,can i mix tramadol and hydrocodone?,"There has been so much written on the bad effects of tramadol, that frankly, I would stay away from it."
459,"There has been so much written on the bad effects of tramadol, that frankly, I would stay away from it.","Not picking a fight, I’m genuinely curious Metro, if you would indulge me what bad effects are you referring to? The potential for inducing seizures, serotonin toxicity when combined with other serotonergic medications, or a lack of efficacy due to polymorphism at 2D6? 

People tend to have *very* strong opinions of tramadol when I ask them about it. They either think it’s the best thing since sliced bread or loathe it. I commonly hear “oh that stuff made me spew so hard!” as a reason for those who aren’t enamoured with it."

466,How many of you get energetic on opioids?,"Different dosages, different effects, I think. 

I had a very interesting experience a week ago (I should mention in advance I do my best to use opiates only once a month or so, cause it is my absolute favourite thing in the world and I know I must be super, super, SUPER careful with it. So, that said, my tolerance is still quite good). I started chewing an overall 60 mg amount of oxy over a time period of 3 hours (1 every hour). I documented it in notes on my phone; from about 10:00 in the morning (when I started) up until about 16:00, I was SUPER hyperactive and, of course, heavinly euphoric. But yeah, super energetic. And then around 16:00 it ""switched"": I was still feeling the last bits of euphoric bliss, but I had ALL energy drained out of me. Luckily I was at home by then, so I could to bed, where I was pleasantly nodding for about 2 hours."
467,How many of you get energetic on opioids?,"Oh most definitely. When I take tramadol it's two ways, and I can control them; either lay back in bed and just nod and chill watch YouTube and play RuneScape for hours or go out with my friend be super social and just do whatever cuz the energy and ""want"" is there."
468,How many of you get energetic on opioids?,"Definitely, at least at my dose. Which is way low compared to most on here I think (7.5 hydrocodone, 3/day). It’s like coffee but better plus lowers my pain which increases my energy. Now if I take it with coffee I can accomplish more in a few hours than in an entire day without. As much as I hate having to take them at least this is an added benefit. 

Morphine is opposite for me. It knocks me out and I hate it. Oxycodone is good though. Dilaudid is also amazing but I don’t get either of those often - just after surgery for a short time if it’s a major surgery.  Never tried anything else other than fentanyl in the hospital."

513,yes but a *thousand times +* better?,"Well not in the moment but over the entire duration, yes.

An orgasm lasts like 15 seconds max, about 30-60 seconds of actual euphoria. I'm speaking of the male orgasm of course as it's the only one I know.

Opiates on the other hand last hours. And in my opinion, even on a moment to moment basis the opiate high is better than an orgasm. Opiates actually relax your body and mind. For hours. So in a second by second basis, added all up, opiates could be considered to be 1000x more euphoric.

It might just be the fact I'm growing older and that I've jerked off too much (and thus have grown a tolerance to orgasm euphoria), but nowadays the main reason I jerk off is to reduce sexual tension, not to orgasm. I mean the orgasm still feels good, but it's mostly the relief of my mind not being consumed by sexual fantasies that I'm after, not the orgasm itself. 

Something else that's interesting is that the urge/desire tk use opiates almost never disappoints while horniness/sexual desire is usually stronger than the actual orgasm. Like, the excitement to use opiates is in balance with their euphoria while sexual desire is usually way stronger than the actual orgasm."

Another great example would be DMT and some of the other psychedelics.  Like when someone tries DMT for the first time they don’t shut up for months to anyone who will listen. Many are afraid or are doubtful of people claims and maybe we are just a bunch of idiots for ingesting these substances. Time will tell.

It would show a glow around the cartoon who’d just eaten and call it the “ Ready Brek glow” 
A warmth and energy boost of sorts. We call having opiades, or more accurately heroin in my case, as getting the Ready Brek glow!!!
I’m a 25 year addict and find life without it gets very boring very quickly but I prefer that to the misery of addiction. However, I still find myself going back to it. Today I did as many addicts do, I told myself that since I’ve been good for nearly a month now I can treat myself to a hit. So I got myself some crack and smack, prepared my snowball or speedball as it’s called in the USA and had a very satisfying hit. Problem 
is now though that I find myself really wanting another and am battling with a decision. 
Do I go to the poker night I’ve had planned with my pals for over a week now or do I go and get more crack and smack.
I’ll probably end up getting the drugs after the poker.
I say all this as I knew I’d want more but told myself the lie that it’s only gonna be the ONE hit.
That is the addict mentally... we are such good liars that we believe our own lies.
So if you want to describe the feeling I’d say “ It’s a nice warm feeling but you will want and need more every time you have it.
I’d also let people know the feeling of withdrawal if I only had the words to explain that feeling to anyone that’s not been through it. I’d say it’s horrible/nasty/ painful and vomit and diarrhoea causing enough that the most decent people in the world will usually resort to stealing out of a family members purse or wallet.
I’m a director of a successful hotel and student accommodation company. My siblings drive cars worth the average suburban house if put together. Because of my addiction I share my wife’s car l, live payday to payday and have in a way been banished to another city with the excuse from my folks that that’s where we’re expanding the biz to.
Still, even though I’m part of all that, going into a shopping mall and taking sunglasses and perfumes or anything else that sells easily is not beneath me if I’m broke.
Sorry it’s so long but I feel there’s an important point to get across.
Otherwise, enjoy getting John folks, but do it for fun, not because you have to just to function.

Has anyone else noticed a subtle degradation of our society? I'm not even that old but it's obvious how different Christmas was when I was 10 in the 2000s vs now. My family and relatives were all together, there was joy in the air, etc. Now my family is fractured, people are dead (of old age). Christmas is still fun but that's only due to my immediate family (which is still fractured by a divorce). What the fuck happened?

Is this why we use opiates? Because everything's falling apart? Or is it just aging? When I was a kid, the entire month of October had this sense of Halloween in the air. It was a cheerful, fake spooky, the best kind of spooky. And it'd climax on Halloween. It was amazing.

Same with Christmas. This awesome and beautiful Christmas cheer all December long. And the closer you got to Christmas the more the cheer spread, it was infectious. It'd be a couple days before Christmas and you'd see people on the street and you couldn't stop smiling and wishing them a Merry Christmas. And the day of Christmas it reached a climax, everyone you met outside would greet you and the air was Merry.

Opiates in ""their"" prime are like the greatest love of all.  Like the anxious, intense butterflies that one feels when starting a new relationship. The nervous energy flowing from the inside, out. The warm buzz that seems to flow over like a warm blanket on a comfortable bed. Life's problem's melt away and any task that must be completed can be done so with ease. Trials that seem daunting while sober are re-written in a language that is easily comprehended. The euphoria that is felt is unmatched and underestimated. It is that feeling that consumes and does not release. Instead of just a great feeling, opiates internalize and become part of a person's emotional response.

569,"How do they feel? 

Opiates in ""their"" prime are like the greatest love of all.  Like the anxious, intense butterflies that one feels when starting a new relationship. The nervous energy flowing from the inside, out. The warm buzz that seems to flow over like a warm blanket on a comfortable bed. Life's problem's melt away and any task that must be completed can be done so with ease. Trials that seem daunting while sober are re-written in a language that is easily comprehended. The euphoria that is felt is unmatched and underestimated. It is that feeling that consumes and does not release. Instead of just a great feeling, opiates internalize and become part of a person's emotional response. While having the ability to bring one up, down and manipulates in order to do ANYTHING to get that euphoric feeling back.  Over time, opiates begin to quickly siphon up all of the time and energy within our day. From sun up to sun down, we yearn for that feeling until it ends.  Then just like that, the most powerful, wonderful euphoric feeling is replaced with a nightmare in the making. 

From this point forward, we will wake up each day with the focus to get dope.",That was beautifully written.

You notice the sunlight through the window is different. She tells you school has been cancelled due to snow fall. 

After a few years, though, when sickness is a daily occurrence, a shot of dope ends up just feeling like a good deep breath of air, unfortunately. Necessary, but incomparable to those first few times."

How about you add a second part to this post, where you talk about the inevitable consequences - withdrawal, flu-like symptoms, diarrhea, cravings. Or maybe the financial consequences of a 200 dollar a day pill habit.  Perhaps you're not there yet. Perhaps you're in the honeymoon stage. But don't worry, you'll get there. It's just a matter of time."

643,Does anybody else prefer hydrocodone high over Oxycodone? Even though oxy is stronger I feel way better euphoria on a equivalent dose of hydrocodone,I swear the high even feels fuller and stronger and has better legs
644,Does anybody else prefer hydrocodone high over Oxycodone? Even though oxy is stronger I feel way better euphoria on a equivalent dose of hydrocodone,Yes at one point in time I felt the same way. But as tolerance grew nothing did the trick anymore and i was simply maintaining.

Even though oxy is stronger I feel way better euphoria on a equivalent dose of hydrocodone,"Yes, but it takes ludicrous amounts for me to get where I want to go.

Even though oxy is stronger I feel way better euphoria on a equivalent dose of hydrocodone,"I prefer hydrocodone but I don’t take it for more than enough pain relief to function.

648,Does anybody else prefer hydrocodone high over Oxycodone? Even though oxy is stronger I feel way better euphoria on a equivalent dose of hydrocodone,"Yes, I personally don't like oxy. It's strong yes, but the high isn't as good for me as taking  higher doses of weaker opiods.

Tbh of my favourite opiate highs is codeine, back when 500mg was plenty strong for me. I remember finally getting oxy and not liking the high. I was finally able to nod again, but I just didn't feel as good. Now codeine would probably do absolutely nothing .."

664,Best and worst 10MG/325 oxy?,"While there may be differences in excipients, binders, fillers and so on which may cause a slight difference in onset for example, provided the active ingredients are the same and in the same doses, they are bio equivalent. 

10mg of oxycodone is 10mg of oxycodone is 10mg of oxycodone. 

People have their preferences or brand loyalty which is understandable, but your opioid receptors aren’t particularly fussed over the brand, they care about the molecule. Not the name on the box that contains said molecule."

Then I got some norco 10/325 blue pills in Arizona and they were ‘crisp’ when I bit into them and I swear I don’t get headaches and only nausea if I do too much.

There is a +/- threshold for all pills as far as Opiate content extends.  Actavis and Mallinckrodt tends to always be on the higher end of that range.  The fillers between manufacturers also differs and those two manufacturers seem to have the least fillers as well as the least harmful fillers (some fillers used by other manufacturers have nasty side effects like turning your tum tum sideways)."

685,How long do the effects of sniffing fent last for the majority of you fine people?,"Fent patches have fentanyl citrate in them

Street drugs have any of like 20 common fent analogues in them. Some like carfentanil have an 8 hour half life (heroin/morphine has a 4 hour half life, so yes this kind of fent lasts like 3x longer than heroin).

Its like how an opiate drug test will show positive from heroin or morphine or codeine and probably opium too.  Saying ""fent sucks"" or fent only lasts 30 mins"" is like someone trying codeine and saying all opiates are weak and suck.  Another example is how oxycodone and oxy morphine are both cousin opioids. Or hydrocodone and hydromorphone.  

When a drug is tweaked it can act completely different than the original analogue.  They were tweaking opana/oxymorphone back 80 years ago and thats when they first found narcan. Yes narcan was made out of opana.

Google images for oxymorphone molecule and naloxone molecule.  Look at how similar they are to each other except a minor tweak, and the result is a completely different drug."

693,Whats the purpose of vitamin c powder? Does it reduce the acidity?,"It's used to acidify heroin #3. I dont know the science beyond that but without adding an acid heroin #3 can only be smoked.

edit: I did some googling. So the deal with #3 is that it's basic and needs an acid added before it will dissolve in water. #4 is a salt so it's ready to go without any extra prep."
694,How many mg if Vitamin C do I add to 10mg of dope?,"You only need to do this with #3, but are you in the US?  You don’t really see much #3 outside of the EU and U.K., most #3 comes from Afghanistan by way of processing in Pakistan.

You use Vitamin C or really any acidifier to break it down into water as Diacetylmorphine base isn’t really soluble in water.  This is done primarily when shooting it, though.

If you’re taking it rectally, I believe the mucus membrane in the rectum is lipid-permeable meaning that #3 would absorb on its own.  Injecting anything with an acidifier hurts like hell, but injecting that in your bum would likely give you fire hole (and possibly an infection)."

I dont think theyll even fill a script over a week - couple weeks old for a CIII narcotic medication. Probably will call the doctor to confirm the script too.

Even if you could fill a script thats a month or longer old, youll still have to wait until the month is over to fill the next one which you cant do if you are still getting scripts from the doctor each month.

Start trying to fill a script thats from 3 doctor visits ago and they'll call the doctor and he'll pull up your name in the prescription database and then hell see you aren't filling the scripts youre supposed to take every day. Then he'll think you either are just using dope or the only other reason you can tell him is you don't need half of the dose he gives you.

So best case if he finds out u dont fill the scripts is hell cut your script in half or probably just kick you off cause you dont need the subs or you get high and dont use the subs"

Went from being a addict POS, to clean, happy, and in love with my fiancee,  with my only child.. felt truly like the luckiest man on earth!  To losing everyone I had except my son(thank god!!!) my mom passed of cancer 5 yrs earlier.
  So I started going hard with every drug I could get my hands on!! Lucky my big sister was so amazing w/my son, she wanted children, but couldn't due 2 medical reasons.  So she loved my son like he was her own child!
   I was 31 now, my son was almost 3, never been arrested, or even a speeding ticket.
  Now always in the hood scoring/using dope, I got caught w/unregistered handgun, syringe(s), heroin, oxycodone, methamphetamine, paraphernalia, and Marijuana (5 felonies, and 2 misdemeanors) blew my life savings on attorneys and fees/fines, did 225 days behind bars, got out clean again (not by choice) son was 4 now, and my sister adopted my son so he wouldn't be a ward of the state. No1 and nothing I was homeless, DCS got involved and I wasnt allowed to see my son, so I started getting f'ed up... Violated parole, did 183 more days, out again, not addicted to any substance, live w/my amazing son, I still use occasionally but in the past 100 days I've used opioids 3 x, benzos a few x,  and speed on occasion (never around my child)...  

    All together I caught 4 separate cases, been hospitalized 5 x, but think I'm finally going uphill again🙆 my tolerance was at onepoint to where I could do every drug I could find, I'd do shots of .3/g ice, with .4 heroin mixed in one shot, on 4 -5bars, drinking beer and liquor,  shooting coke, all in one session 😔   an either wake up in hospital, or pass out somewhere just to wake up and try to push myself farther the next day... I know I can die of an overdose, but I tried my hardest, but never succeded.. 

  Lol,  I'll probably end up dying from someone ridiculous like suffocating while taking my shirt off now. I used a lifetimes ""luck"" in a matter of a yr or 2... But I appreciate everything everyone sooooooo much now that I've been in such dark places... Even a plate of food is like what most probably feel winning the lotto.. lol"

I started out paying 40cents per 30mg Roxi...without any insurance just straight up cash at mom and pop pharmacies (because CVS and Walgreens always gave people a hard time and lied about stock) and I remember towards the end of that time...I was paying $12 per pill at the pharmacy.

A thing the book mentioned was how many **millionaires** were born during that era. The doctors, their employees, the pharmacies like you mentioned, then there were the people who ran businesses based on owning a passenger van, and charging addicts cash+half of their script to hook them up with various doctors that would accept them, then drive them to all these different docs, all over the southeast mainly.


in fact, the majority of these van owners didn't even charge cash. They would scrounge up the most desperate addicts they could find, and then take them to as many different doctors as possible. I'm talking making a whole week out of these trips. Then, by the end of it all, both the owner and the addicts would have quite literally thousands of different pills.

And the cycle would repeat next month lol. Or hell, even the next week!"

It was extremely common to have 8-10 doctors you went to a month, and even days where you went to 2 or 3 different doctors and got massive scripts from each of them.  If you were a sponsor, (someone who paid the visit cost plus the cost to get the scripts out of the pharmacy for other people, so you could get the pills insanely cheap) you were rich basically.  Addicts obviously aren't good at keeping 2k on them to pay for their own visit and scripts, so sponsors were well sought after for being able to have the capital up front.

I remember there were even a few pharmacies that would basically ""fill"" the prescription for you, but hold onto it and let you buy single pills or a few at a time, especially for Oxy 80s since they were always expensive (2k+ for a script of 150).  Even had a pharmacy that sold single wrapped syringes that I would literally buy with script haha."

814,Do you know what the best part about being sober is?,"I’ve always made a point to avoid dealers that also use.  There are many reasons for that, but the main one is: their habit will always come first.

All those phone calls you never returned? All those those times you sold me fake roxies at full price even though I insisted they were pressed? Yea... I’m good, bro. I’m clean, and I have the power now, so FUCK YOU.”"

I’ve had super shitty sobriety where I’d be suicidal but have no cravings to use.

On suboxone again for the last 2 years but that 3.5 years of real sobriety gave me some tools to keep working on myself and be happy"

Not cool on the licking sheets of acid part though, shoulda just licked a corner off each sheet that way the tab still has some in it and nobody has any chance of getting caught/scammed lol.

846,Do you know what the best part about being sober is?,"Sounds like such a nightmare. The other way of obtaining is the way to go as far as reliability and quality but it gets old quick too. 

Being sober and enjoying music and sensations again is great. Drinking with friends without feeling muscle aches or an extra terrible withdrawal hangover in the morning. etc etc

but then life comes around and gets me down and the dope calls me back lmao. That's when I gotta go to the gym instead but so much easier said than done for some reason"
847,Do you know what the best part about being sober is?,"Yes. When you're away from that life and those people for a while, and then get back into it, it's even more annoying than before. The ""I got you for sure"" and then fucking you around for 6 hours, the ""yeah I can get some"" and then you pick them up and THEN they call and ask if they can get it, the middle manning, the feeling of wasting entire days waiting around on people for drugs. It's so fucking annoying. I'm a junkie and I dont act that way or pull that shit, so I dont have sympathy, patience or understanding for people who do. The people who tell you to come through and then let you sit in your car for 45 minutes outside their place. All of it. It makes me mad even typing about it lol."
848,Do you know what the best part about being sober is?,"When I was getting high, it seemed like I had an unlimited network of total fucking morons who thought they knew everything.

All this, and amazingly nobody ever had a stable job, their own car, a sense of pride in anything. I'm beyond grateful that these total wastes of life aren't anywhere near me anymore."

Y'all stay safe out there."
853,Do you know what the best part about being sober is?,"Gotta be honest, my life is boring and I actually like the process and potential danger of sizing people up, figuring out their lies or truth.

Making eye contact with dealers and asking about their wares. Scoring in sketchy neighborhoods is one of my favorite parts of the ritual. There are cops around all the time, but I love the rush of scoring. It’s similar to when I used to shoplift as a teenager for fun, gets me awake and alert. I feel like it’s benefits my everyday life a lot, I can feel when someone is lying and if someone is a danger now. I like fighting too, but I’m a pacifist by nature, just if someone else wants to go there I don’t mind because there’s a part of me that is uber violent and really enjoys a good conflict, unless I’m the one holding. Then it becomes a huge issue, don’t want to get arrested."

I feel you, this life is horrible and I’m glad that one of us escaped.  unfortunately I’m one of those people that just doesn’t care about living or dying, don’t get me wrong I’d fight for survival but if I die it’s no big loss to anyone. My life is a complete waste of potential, I wasn’t taught what I needed to be taught and I wasn’t aggressive enough with my own studies. There is no tribe anymore, there are no elders, the villages have burned and it’s everyone for themselves. I’m not depressed at all though, even if my thoughts are far from it. I’m actually a happy person stuck in a shit life.  I’ve lost all faith in humanity and my faith in my self is stronger than the faith most people have in themselves and that terrifies the shit outta me, because I have very little. How can a person make clear decisions if they don’t believe in their perception of reality? They can’t and they don’t, everyone walks around in a cloudy ass haze and I can’t be around that shit unless I’m using something.  I’m trying to quit, but I’m pretty fucked as I can walk 10 minutes from my job and I’m near it.  I think I’ll have to change my job and city and really need to get away from people for my work.

When you start to fix these problems that were there from before that you ignored or escaped from things will get much better and being sober will be easier once your life sober improves. If you fix things and have a good life, you are way more likely to see the bigger picture and be less inclined to use.

People say things get better sober. Yes they do, and it takes time but its a lot of effort. It sucks but simply jusy being sober is not enough, what is important is recovery and they are not the same.

It may feel like you're just as hopeless as before except now you don't have anything to numb the pain/make you feel better, but that's not true. When people say they are functioning addicts, they are functioning to the level that they have set in mind by a certain standard to be functional. What I mean by that is, you might measure functional by keeping a job and having a house, car etc or whatever. The truth is when you are an addict, it's impossible to fix the things in life that can make your life better in fact at best you are pausing time and not making things worse.

 Now that you're sober it will take a long time to accept and move on. The only way to do so is to start by forgiving yourself. Forgiveness is not a one time thing that is in an instant that you say it and it's over, you have to remind yourself everyday. Once you forgive yourself you'll start caring about yourself and realise your worth and now since you have started loving yourself, it will become a lot easier moving forward as your decisions will start to take shape of someone who has themselves as their best interest.

I think i'll stop rambling actually.. I know getting told this stuff sucks listening to because you feel like complete shit at the time."
861,Do you know what the best part about being sober is?,"I couldn’t have done all that shit without drugs. Today the anxiety would give me a panic attack. 

It’s all good with a regular dealer. I had one who had a straight f/t job. We would pay him every fortnight, and every day at 6am he would drop off deals for us on his way to work. That was living!  ....scoring off randoms in the middle of a dodgy suburb is stressful, even when you’re dressed down, and a regular."
862,Do you know what the best part about being sober is?,"I always hated those people. When I sold I would go out of my way to help people out at the few that tried to fuck me over were literally trash. 

Why even do that? Treat people right and they keep coming back and making you money, treat them like shit and steal from them and yay you made an extra 20 today but what about tomorrow when they don't come back?

Slinging dope is a business just like any other, if people realized that and treated it as such we'd all be better off"

I don't believe they help with depression, I mean yeah when you take them they make you feel like your depression is better because you're under there influence, but you haven't fixed shit. I mean in the same way opiates help too, because they numb you from your depression, but all of that shit is just temporary. It's not actually helping you and eventually you'll have to deal with it or keep suffering even if its yeara down the line.

If you use them once in a long time there's no harm, but once you're an addict then things change I guess. Controlled responsible use + something horrible unrelated happening in your life unexpectedly out of your control can lead to bad addiction when everything goes out the window and you try cope .

Shit happens man, think about it nobody really sets out to become an addict. It creeps up on you, a dangerous time is when you've been using responsibly for so long and start to think you can always be in control and that you're different from other people. 

Basically the one thing I like about NA which is the reason I go is because listening to other people's experiences makes you realise that fuck, I'm not alone with how I feel. Non-addicts just can never understand what an addict feels or goes through. Someone can tell their experience and it will almost feel surreal that they don't know you at all, but they've word for word narrated an experience or behaviour that 100% describes yours as if they were speaking about you.."

I have one street dealer who can get as many real 30s as you want, never runs dry.  He is a Yemeni dude, though, from a family that owns 30+ bodegas in Manhattan.

Suboxone/sublocade gave me the opportunity to get my life back on track but I still don't feel like I have myself back.  Shit I've been doing opiates so long I dont even know what it even feels like to be sober. I cannot wait till the day when I'm really free.  All that shit blocks emotions. Yeah I lowered my dose and they came back a little but I can only imagine being completely free. I swear times I got bailed out and was clean (forced to kick) the air smelt different.  My home smelt different.  Hard to explain but alot of shit feels different when your 100% clean...  not bashing anything cause like I said I am on sublocade and suboxone b4 that and it's been a God sent. Seriously I have improved my current life as well as I am getting well prepared for old age. I couldn't do that while on dope.

Making it hard to travel or work because of restriction. I see it as a way to get mine from the unwanted of society. If it works for you and that upur jouney all the best but were i live ive seen doctors put people on methadone and suboxone for crack addiction.

Next time we go we'll ask for 29 gauge points. But being a certified phlebotomist, I know pretty much everything I need to know about needles and getting a vein. I've been an IV drug user for 11 years now, and there is definitely something different about the insulin needles they're selling now. Only a single Walmart in our city would sell bags of 10. All other Walmart's required you to buy a box of 10 bags. Every other pharmacy required you to have a diabetic card or they **would not** sell you points. 
But recently, just in the past 7 or months, you are able to buy them anywhere. HEB, CVS, Walgreens, etc.... idk if it has something to do with needle exchanges being legal in our city now, but it might. Certain Walgreens locations are now charging $10 for a bag of 10 points now, as opposed to the normal $3 for a bag. Which is just outrageous.
Ever since they started selling points everywhere, it's like they've made them harder to use for the purpose of abusing drugs. Like my gf said, they go dull **SUPER** fast. And sometimes a fresh point will clog the very first time you use it. 
And it's not like were doing dope that's filled with  lactose which is guaranteed to clog a 31 gauge.
We're doing BTH with literally no lac in it whatsoever. And sometimes they arent even really clogged, they just refuse to register. And if they do, it's an extremely slow register to the point where you cant even tell if it's in or not. We used to be able to use the same rig 10 times before tossing it. But that's out of the question now. They have, without a doubt, changed something about the insulin needles. Maximum uses out of a point now is 3 times. When it used to be the **MINIMUM** amount of uses we'd get out of one was 10. I swear we were able to use the same rig for like 25 times if we really needed to.

You're right about no way to control it - I have heard that ""chippers"" exist, and I'm sure they do somewhere, but the only people I've met who dabble in H without getting hooked have been hard-core alcoholics who don't get hooked on H because alcohol is their DOC. 

>Starting to get tiresome and feels like I’ll be like this forever.

I know the feeling, man. Sometimes, getting an overwhelming sense of despair and getting, as they say in AA, ""sick and tired of being sick and tired"" can be a galvanizing moment that you can use to propel yourself to quit. 

As for me, I keep stopping and relapsing constantly. Since I started at age 20 (I'm 26 now) the longest I've stayed clean is 7 months in rehab, and outside of rehab the longest I've gone is 4 months. I've spent a year clean in month-long stretches divided by briefer relapses, and have done countless fortnights + weeks clean before breaking again. For all of 2018 I was in a really regular pattern of using for 3-7 days, stopping and trying to stay stopped for 1-4 weeks and then relapsing again. Since the lapses were relatively short I managed to keep my shit kind of together. I have the easiest job in the world since I work at a cinema, so thankfully I didn't lose my job since it didn't matter if I was at work high off my ass, stone cold sober, sick as fuck or even at the tail end of a speed ball binge since a chimpanzee could do my job. 

I wouldn't have called it being a functional addict since my life was pretty shitty for a 26 year old who always had high ambitions, but it wasn't spiraling out of control either. I'm right now though in the worst relapse I've had in years, catalyzed by the stupid decision I made while I was high to let a friend of mine who also uses come and live with me, resulting in a 3 month bender. I really need to pull this back *now*, since the consequences are starting to get really severe. I am on the verge of being evicted from my flat, I'm on my final warning at work, I owe a lot of money to relatives - it's just all pretty fucked, so I have to make a concerted effort to put a stop to this now and get some sobriety back.

Didn't mean to write an essay, but it felt good to vent, and I appreciate you asking. How long have you been doing this comrade? How old are you??"

This is not the life that you want.  This is just what feels good right now and comfortable.  It’s heroins ability to not just block physical pain but our mental and emotional pains.   Emotional withdrawal is stronger than the physical.  That’s why you’ll hear of many people who successfully quit explaining the feeling being similar to breaking up with a significant other or losing a best friend.   It can always get worse.   Don’t wait till rock bottom bc you might experience things you could’ve done without and will have many stories you should never share with people who love you.   That square one feeling odd very mutual, my friend.  I could be ready to die through WD for my family, thoroughly convinced myself I will never touch again, and then soon after, cravings get so bad it’s like my body is craving food but cannot be satiated.   

Maintenance drugs are hard af to kick too so if that’s your route, two weeks max.   I was “sober” for two years on Suboxone (decided to taper and quit when I realized how dirty a suboxone doc.  He was actually upset I was taking less than 8mg a day and insisted that the plan was to be his cash patient forever) and now I have to kick this and it’s gna be long af before I kick (day 20).  

I’m just prepared to suffer bro.   I can barely enjoy life and my testosterone level so low I can hardly get out of bed and losing weight like a mofo.   But it’s gotten better since the first week and I know it’ll only get better from here on, but I walk just as slippery slope as you, my friend.  You’re so young brov.  When I was 20, Drugs were a way for me to connect with people, party with hot chicks, community, etc.   I was a very ambitious and smart kid who set himself up for success but let drugs take it all away.   Building myself up from scratch.  (Emotional pain of what could’ve been).   Like you said tho bro, just got man the fuck up.   A $20 sack smoked could probably keep my fried all fckin day bc of how low my tolerance probably is now.   And I’d more relief and happiness and warmth Than I can remember.   But I gotta man the eff up.   And handle this shit.  Because for you to get right in the head, you need months off this shit.  And to be truly back to normal, I think it takes two years. And I’m headstrong.  Spent 8 months of this year building my physique in the gym and I’m prepared to sacrifice all my gains and get fat for this.  (At least that’s what I tell myself today).  

Honestly bro, I wake up after like 2-4 hours of the worst sleep but I start my day off praying to God to help me be victorious until noon, then at lunch, pray for strength to make it to dinner (im probably eating close to nothing at these meals bc of WD)   I ask God to remind me that’s it’s a matter of “yes vs no” and that it does get better.  That I deserve to suffer and deal with my issues the hard way or this experience won’t make me stronger. And remember to be Thabkful for your family.  I imagine the roles of me and my loved ones reversed and it helps keep things in perspective.  overthinking shit = creating problems that don’t even exist.  Stay up bud.  God bless."

981,"Thanks for the reply! You're right about no way to control it - I have heard that ""chippers"" exist, and I'm sure they do somewhere, but the only people I've met who dabble in H without getting hooked have been hard-core alcoholics who don't get hooked on H because alcohol is their DOC. 

>Starting to get tiresome and feels like I’ll be like this forever.

I know the feeling, man. Sometimes, getting an overwhelming sense of despair and getting, as they say in AA, ""sick and tired of being sick and tired"" can be a galvanizing moment that you can use to propel yourself to quit. 

As for me, I keep stopping and relapsing constantly. Since I started at age 20 (I'm 26 now) the longest I've stayed clean is 7 months in rehab, and outside of rehab the longest I've gone is 4 months. I've spent a year clean in month-long stretches divided by briefer relapses, and have done countless fortnights + weeks clean before breaking again. For all of 2018 I was in a really regular pattern of using for 3-7 days, stopping and trying to stay stopped for 1-4 weeks and then relapsing again. Since the lapses were relatively short I managed to keep my shit kind of together. I have the easiest job in the world since I work at a cinema, so thankfully I didn't lose my job since it didn't matter if I was at work high off my ass, stone cold sober, sick as fuck or even at the tail end of a speed ball binge since a chimpanzee could do my job. 

I wouldn't have called it being a functional addict since my life was pretty shitty for a 26 year old who always had high ambitions, but it wasn't spiraling out of control either. I'm right now though in the worst relapse I've had in years, catalyzed by the stupid decision I made while I was high to let a friend of mine who also uses come and live with me, resulting in a 3 month bender. I really need to pull this back *now*, since the consequences are starting to get really severe. I am on the verge of being evicted from my flat, I'm on my final warning at work, I owe a lot of money to relatives - it's just all pretty fucked, so I have to make a concerted effort to put a stop to this now and get some sobriety back.

Didn't mean to write an essay, but it felt good to vent, and I appreciate you asking. How long have you been doing this comrade? How old are you??",But it’s definitely Put some things into perspective now that I read your comment. As far as using it to propel myself.

So basically just dabble with em I guess. I finally mixed them together because I have been prescribed klonopin for my anxiety and panic attacks when I fly. However the kpins don't work 100% when I fly, so eventually I mixed in some oxy and I was calm, relaxed, no anxiety at all. Also mix em to get rid of social anxiety, it really helps. Never went passed 30mg oxy and 1.5mg kpins in a day. Love em, but the constipation sucks lol. Also getting a limp dick and being able to jackhammer your partner for hours is both a blessing and a curse lol."

If so then be really, really careful. I can guarantee that the vast majority of us would kill to be in your position, since you are in that glorious position where your brain hasn't decided that opiates are vital to its survival yet, so at the moment you can pick up & put down oxy without suffering the physical repercussions. The key part there is *at the moment*. The distinction between the purely recreational user that can binge for weeks at a time with nothing but a little depression afterwards and the rest of us who can't spend a weekend nodding out without having to go through 5 days of hell for our sins is a one-way street - it's a binary, all-or-nothing situation. 

If you go just a little too far and increase your dose by a few pills or use far a couple of days longer than usual then you can cross the line, open up Pandora's box and get to experience your very first opiate withdrawal. If at that point your daily using streak had only been a couple of weeks then your withdrawal may be relatively mild - still really unpleasant & nasty, but not the full on agony of a long-term addict going cold turkey. However, after your first withdrawal, your brain & body will be primed for it, and you know then that if you use for that period of time again you'll get that sickness again, only this time it could come even if your binge was a day or two earlier than the last one. Then the next time you'll find yourself getting sick after using for just a week, and the withdrawal will be getting more & more intense every time even if your binges are shorter. The withdrawals will hit faster & harder as time goes on, until inevitably you will reach your nadir. 

For most of us opiate users the end point is that every time they use for 3 days they will then have to go through withdrawal (though some of our unluckier comrades get it after 2 days, and you even hear of people being thrown into withdrawal after using for a single day!). You will look back fondly at these days where you could play with opiates like others can with weed, booze, coke etc. since after that first withdrawal every single time you indulge in your oxys you'll have the looming threat of the sickness hanging over your head, and as you probably know, it's very easy to tell yourself you'll just use for one or two days, but it's a lot harder to actually say no when the third day rolls around. 

If my read of the situation is right and you are in that blessed situation where you have yet to get opiate WD for the first time, tread really, really carefully, because after that first withdrawal you can't go back. If you exert self-control and discipline and just make sure you never go overboard and get your first withdrawal, then opiates can remain a fun indulgence rather than something inextricably linked to the sickness & desperation that turns good men into thieving criminals, modest women into street walking prostitutes & kids into corpses."

That was a nice story, I like your writing.","No, no, no, no!! Dude!!! Please man, don't make the mistake that I have personally made and that countless other users have made. We binge for a long period of time, we stop, we feel basically fine, so we assume that we are immune to opiate withdrawals, that our body chemistry is different, that our brains must be wired differently so we don't get the sickness that other junkies do. It's a nice thought, a comforting one, but it's a delusion! It's an easy trap to fall into but it's simply not true. Before my first real withdrawal, I would binge for weeks at a time. I used daily for six weeks at one point and then stopped and just had some mild restlessness, yawned a lot and felt a little uncomfortable. ""Huh"", I thought, ""this is it?? I guess I just don't get real withdrawals!"". This emboldened me to continue pushing it, and each long, uninterrupted binge that ended with just a few days of the mildest discomfort lulled me into a false sense of security. I genuinely wondered if maybe all junkies just massively exaggerated the scope of withdrawals, but then settled on the thought that maybe my body chemistry just meant that my experience of withdrawals wouldn't be too bad. 

**I was wrong.** I eventually went on a binge, stopped, and then immediately knew something was different. Something was wrong. I tried to shake it off, but then what had been mild discomfort every other time quickly turned into a horrible mental & physical ordeal, and I soon realized how foolish I had been to assume that what I had gone through before was indicative of withdrawal, how naive I had been to assume that I was special. Opiates can wrap you in a heavenly warm embrace and give you so much, but when they turn on you they can bring you to your knees. Please, be under no illusions. You have yet to experience any withdrawal, but you are not different, or immune. You have just not crossed that line yet. if you are careful, you need never cross it, but you will be much more likely to not have to go through withdrawal if you always bear in mind that it's something that **will** happen if you aren't cautious, and then after it's happened once you will not be able to enjoy opiates in the same carefree way again. Please, be cautious, buddy."

It's a bitch, isn't it? To those around us, it looks as if we are choosing this life, and in a way we are. What they don't understand, however, is that the choice we make to use drugs is not the same as their choice to, for example, have a bagel in the morning or drink a couple of beers. It's a choice but there's an enormous emotional and unconscious weight behind it and the conscious part of it is less of a decision of whether or not to use and more like a decision to either resign to what a loud screaming voice in our minds is telling us we really want or to battle against it constantly. That's why the people around us who don't use get so frustrated, I guess - they can't understand that it's not as simple as ""Just don't take the drugs anymore"". Everyone has a divided mind between their impulsive self and their higher self - that's why people slip on their diets, skip a jog, procrastinate etc. but with addicts the impulsive side has so, so much more power because the drugs so directly tap into that primal part of our brain associated with pleasure, compulsion & need that it often feels to me as if the conscious, rational part of my mind is a like a man trying to hold back a tidal wave with a shower curtain. 

I've heard many people speak of crack in those kind of disparaging terms! It's just so hard to turn down, isn't it? I don't have so much of a problem with crack - I do it pretty much every time I do H, but because of the H I don't get the crash and overwhelming impulse to keep doing more so I can use a moderate amount just to spice up my shots and it mixes really pleasantly with the H. 

I admire your candor and honesty about opiates. I feel like a lot of users may feel the same way, but because of cultural & societal pressure feel the need to pay lip-service to a desire to quit even when they don't actually have that. 

Interesting about your perspective on crack vs meth. We don't really have meth here in the UK and so I've never tried it so I'm interested - can you tell me how the 2 compare?"

being on methadone, i realize some people don't consider it clean, or it substitutes one thing for another, but for me it keeps me stable and it works for now while i build up my life. i miss getting high sometimes, but i don't miss having to wait around on people, getting sick, spending all of my money, often getting subpar shit that barely got me well, basically my life revolving around dope. and i rarely ever even got a rush so it was more to feel normal.  right now my methadone dose does a really good job of taking away the cravings and im close to getting my second take home bottle. im slowly building my life back up. i plan on tapering at some point not until im at a point where i have too much to lose if i go back to using","Good for you!

It doesn’t matter what other people think. They don’t understand the difference between addiction and dependence, let alone the intricacies of your mental health. 

If you’re more stable and reducing the harm to your body/soul, you’re doing a good things for yourself. “Clean” is a bullshit make believe concept that has no real meaning."
999,Is this the life you want or do you want to or are trying to quit?,"I’ve been thinking about quitting for months, since May, just because pills are a pain for me to acquire unless I play it by ear and just get my fix everyday. Then it’s easy, but I don’t like to do that, I like to have a mountain of stuff to sit on. The other options are lame... kratom, subs, done. So really if I continue it’s either get tech savvy or BTH, which has been my go to for a fix, but I’m really bad with it as I get to a carpet surfing point when I quit, which I only get like that with crack binges to say how bad it can be. I’ve IVed before but not really H, just coke and meth, except in the past there was about 15 times I IV H before I had a tolerance or dependence. My point being if I cross that line again, I’ll be in serious shit. So this is my first serious quit for the time being, but I was pretty dedicated the past 5 years, pretty much everyday I had some form of opioid even if it was weak, I don’t know I’m really just trying on sobriety again. See if it fits, I don’t think relapse or withdrawals are good for a person. I think it’s much preferable to stay well or nothing. I love opioids, but I also like doing things and I can’t have a need my fix first and then do. It’s annoying to keep saying “I’m not well enough to get this big project done, better snort/smoke more”"

Long story short, no, this is really not the life I want","My heart goes out to you. It must be so much harder when you have a legit pain reason to quit, and tbh if I had chronic pain then I wouldn't see a reason to stop. On the bright side, developments are being made for alternate painkillers, and it's likely in the next decade or so non-opioid effective painkillers will come to market. Research is being done into pharmaceuticals that mimic the painkilling effects of opioids but separate the high/addiction/withdrawal that comes with it, since the mechanism by which morphine and other opiates kill pain is actually distinct from the pharmacodynamic by which it produces a high. There is even preliminary evidence to suggest that the endorphin receptors which are implicated in dependence & withdrawal are a different subset to the ones that produce the euphoria, which could mean in the future we may have opiates that give the high without the dependence. However, this is all future speculation, and for the present if you have chronic pain and opiates alleviate that then I think you should have unfettered, permanent access to them. I hope you have an understanding doctor and aren't forced to score your opiates off the street when there's a legitimate medical reason for you having them?"

That said I have a great job, marriage and son. I do most of the things I did before getting crps thanks to the opiate (when I don’t take it in addition to the others I can’t function so I know that’s what helps the most).

I've hit an artery a few times, but these days if the blood flow is particularly strong or the blood looks too bright i inject the tiniest little bit to test if I'm in an artery so I don't put much in there. The first time I did it though I'd been poking myself for over half an hour, and was so excited to finally get blood (and having never hit an artery before) I immediately pushed the plunger down quickly, and I literally screamed out in pain before I even realized what was happening, as well as actually involuntarily tearing the needle out of my arm and throwing it across the room. I didn't even do that consciously and would never have done that since there was someone in the room with me (it didn't go near them thankfully) but the burning pain was so intense I did it without thinking. Thankfully the pain passes in a few seconds, but that few seconds literally feel like the inside of your arm has become a chemical fire with a really sharp & intense agonizing pain. It was probably made worse by the fact this was back in the earlier days when I was putting *way* too much citric in my shots. Almost immediately my arm started swelling with these giant blotchy patches and my hand inflated to 3x its size. I thought I'd have to call an ambulance, but I googled it and found that it would resolve itself pretty quickly, which it did. I slowly got the effect of the shot, but there was definitely no rush. Since then I've never put a whole shot in an artery, but when I've done little test pushes into suspect spots that may be a vein or an artery a similar thing has happened, but never any rush.

absolutely, was pure reflex/reaction like pulling your hand away from a hot stove.","What really sucks is that not all arteries give a super strong pulse of bright pink frothy blood, I've hit arteries that had blood that was just a few shades lighter than venous blood and with pressure the same as a vein. I've also had many spots that once were excellent veins that I was using regularly, and then one day I'll put the pin in as usual, same angle, same place and it's suddenly an artery instead of a vein. I was skeptical the first time it happened since veins & arteries are distinct, but after it had happened a couple of times when I was *certain* I was putting the needle in the exact same place, I did some googling and found that apparently when the lining of a vein is sufficiently damaged your body can re-route collapsed veins into nearby arteries, so a spot you think is a vein can suddenly turn into an artery which is a very unpleasant surprise when you're expecting an old faithful vein to deliver your hit to your brain as usual and instead feel like someone's managed to set the inside of your arm on fire."

1139,"Do you still get ""high""? - Q's on enhancing heroin",Just want to add that you can absolutely OD from “just” sniffing. I don’t know why people think only those who IV can OD. This is a very dangerous mindset to have and to pass on to other users.
1140,"Do you still get ""high""? - Q's on enhancing heroin","I had the opportunity to get ahold of some stuff this past weekend that is as good as any I have ever done and I have been in the game a long time. I shoot. My buddy snorts. We split a G and I reminded him a dozen times as I took him home to be extra careful. He did one line while I was with him. It couldnt have been more than a .15. He said he did a bump when he got home and thats the last thing he remembered until the paramedics revived him with Narcan. You can absolutely OD snorting. It is less common than shooting but I know two people that are now deceased that I knew personally and that I know only snorted. They still OD'd and died. So be careful. It is a harmful mindset.

As I mentioned before Ive been in the dope game a long time. 10ish years at this point. Its very rare to get ""high"" any more. That perfect dose is hard to attain. Its such a fine line to get where you want to be. Its hard/expensive to get there. Then if you are lucky enough its easy to misjudge and overdo it and wind up passed out or worse. The easiest way to get there for me is a benzo combo. And other than that I find that you absolutely must seek out the highest quality stuff. At one point I would often just take the first opportunity I had to get something as long as I knew it was decent. Just to get well or because I couldn't wait. Nowadays I will make myself wait for hours or almost a full day in order to get ahold of whoever is holding the highest quality stuff. And I'm always glad after the fact. I hate settling for something and not having any more money to spend later when I get a call about the good shit."

There's just something about the control you have when smoking/vaporizing that makes it a safer and more reliable method, I've found. Whenever I had the choice between smoking and snorting, I noticed my high could always be tailor-made better with vapin'. You should try to vape it out of a ""globe"" meth pipe if you decide you wanna vape. People like aluminum foil...I never did, hated it, couldn't fucking hit it without help.

1232,Opiates causing lactation?,"Ok I should actually take my shitstirring hat off and put on my doctor hat and say that it’s *possible* that it can be caused by a prolactinoma which is a (usually) benign tumor (so not cancerous, just a growth) that can cause prolactin release. 

The reason I’m sceptical it’s this is because you don’t mention any common symptoms and you’re on at least one type of medication that is notorious for causing it (especially when abused). 

Other medications that can cause it are antipsychotics, drugs for hypertension, birth control pills (not likely given you’re lesbian) and medications for N+V. 

If you’re concerned, see your GP, but it sounds like a textbook case of abusing opioids and expressing milk.

1234,Opiates causing lactation?,"Centrally active Mu opioid receptor agonists have a wide range of effects on the endocrine system which are primarily mediated through modulation and negative feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis which can manifest in clinically significant hypogonadism in the male and female of the species which can cause changes in libido, fertility, impotence in the male and so on. 

This phenomenon is different however. 

Opioids agonists exert inhibitory effects on dopamine release in the hypothalamus. Higher dopamine levels, inhibit prolactin. Lower dopamine levels cause prolactin release. Thereby if opioids lower dopamine release, then more prolactin is produced (which causes milk production). 

Therefore we can safely conclude that you are afflicted with hyperprolactinaemia which is causing galactorrhea due to the increased prolactin levels in your body, caused by opioid agonist activity in the hypothalamus, by inhibiting dopamine secretion. 

For those who may be interested, this effect can be induced by the use of the D2 antagonist, metoclopramide which is used for (among other things) nausea. Although domperidone is generally preferred as it doesn’t cross the BBB. It’s sometimes given to mothers who have difficulty producing milk, due to its properties as a galactogogue. 

If anyone is wondering, prolactin is produced all the time by the body *unless* it is suppressed by dopamine. This is why anti dopaminergic drugs, cause a surge of prolactin. It’s a negative feedback system. 

Oh also, when people ask me for advice about antiemetics for N+V and I always say I prefer 5HT3 antagonists to dopamine antagonists due to the “unpleasant side effects” the latter can cause, THIS is one of those side effects. I’m a dude. I don’t want to suffer gynecomastia or be able to be milked like a fucking dairy cow, just to avoid spewing. 

Also when people say to me “Hey Doc, nice stash of OxyContin you have there. Why don’t you take it?”  

Now you also know. 

Take care.

Hence why very few pure or biased Kappa agonists are utilised in clinical practice for analgesia. 

If one combines a biased Mu receptor antagonist such as samidorphan, to counteract buprenorphines partial agonism there, one can attenuate the depressive state, while also ensuring one does not impart mild euphoria due to action at the Mu binding site, which would be an undesirable side effect in this context. 

NMDA antagonists are also finding increased utility for treatment resistant depression.

1271,"And why would one add a mu antagonist to counter the receptors currently filled by the bupe? I dont get that part of what you wrote.

The dark side lol, niceee","Because, as I wrote (sorry that’s not meant to sound condescending) the real utility of buprenorphine as an antidepressant is due to its antagonism of the Kappa receptor. 

The fact that buprenorphine acts as a partial agonist of the Mu receptor, is in this case, undesirable because it can cause euphoria. We don’t want that because it can lead to addictive behaviour and makes you feel “high”. 

That might be desirable in an analgesic or unavoidable in opioid replacement pharmacotherapy. But it’s not something we want in an antidepressant. 

Unfortunately you can’t seperate buprenorphines Kappa antagonism and it’s Mu agonism. So, we have to block the Mu receptor by using an antagonist. However if we used naloxone or naltrexone, they don’t really discriminate between the Mu, Kappa & Delta. So if you used naloxone or naltrexone, you’d kick the bupe off the Kappa receptor (which is NOT what we want). If we did that, then the anti depressive effects wouldn’t work. 

So we want a biased antagonist that will preferentially bind to and antagonise the Mu receptor and block the euphoria. 

If we do that, we maintain the antagonism at the Kappa and retain the anti depressive response. Which is really, the whole point. While blocking the Mu receptor which gets you “high”. 

Does that make some semblance of sense?"
1272,"Buprenorphine works well for depression due to its antagonism at the Kappa receptor which therefore induces well not euphoria, rather an absence of dysphoria. Agonism of the KOP induces an antinociceptive response, respiratory depression in a dose dependent manner and also dysphoria. Hence why very few pure or biased Kappa agonists are utilised in clinical practice for analgesia. 

If one combines a biased Mu receptor antagonist such as samidorphan, to counteract buprenorphines partial agonism there, one can attenuate the depressive state, while also ensuring one does not impart mild euphoria due to action at the Mu binding site, which would be an undesirable side effect in this context. 

NMDA antagonists are also finding increased utility for treatment resistant depression. 

Opioids work well for depression, but relapse often occurs upon cessation and they really only mask the symptoms and they have a plethora of undesirable physiological effects. 

Good luck.

It’s addicting, doesn’t matter if it’s subs or done.. if it tickles the receptor, it’s gonna cause habitual use. Tramadol was super effective at taking away my depression, but I’ve heard the withdrawals are nightmarish. O-dmst is a thing, but I would look up every negative before touching it. I’m sure it’s terrible long term. I’ve heard both subs and methadone taken as prescribed can be bad for your teeth long term, so they should be taken less then a month, IMO. methadone because it leeches calcium and subs because of the way they dissolve in the mouth. You could try kratom, which is relatively safe, but will backfire on you eventually and you’d have to pay the piper. Have you tried ketamine or shrooms/acid?

Oxycodone, it really doesn’t matter. The prescribing literature says it’s fine to take with food, there is evidence absorption can be enhanced when taken with a high fat meal & some preparations are specifically designed to be crushed and mixed into food or through a feeding tube. 

Yeah gabapentin is a funny one insofar as it doesn’t really display linear absorption kinetics. The more you take, the less is absorbed. Pregabalin doesn’t exhibit this behaviour and is far more linear and predictable."

Is 30mg of oxy anywhere near an amount that could cause an OD?","This is actually a somewhat involved question that involves internalisation, phosphorylation & downregulation of receptors in the presence of a CNS Mu, Kappa, Delta opioid receptor antagonist and the attendant issues, the short answer is:

I wouldn’t bother. Naltrexone is pretty good at doing its thing.

1430,"Idk if you're making fun of me for saying vagina owners instead of women or if trans men don't actually get horrifyingly excruciating cramps but if it's the first thing then I just wanna explain myself in that I said vagina owners instead of women bc men with vaginas do exist bc trans men do exist and they absolutely 100% are still men regardless of what hardware they got going on in their downstairs area. Hopefully I don't sound dickish saying this bc that's not my intent, just trying to educate people who may not know what I meant by the title.

If it's the latter then I am extremely envious of trans men bc my period always sucks so fucking badly.","You can't be a man with a vagina, if you have male chromosomes you are a man, if you have female chromosomes you are a woman."

Apparently if you do heroin long enough, it can cause you to stop having a period. Its weird and probably not healthy. It's kinda nice  not having to deal with all the pain and feeling gross. I'm saving money not having to buy tampons too :)  which..I spend on dope lol. I wonder how common it is to not have your period after long term use. I havent asked any of the girls I know about it."

1523,Any other vagina owners out there suffer from this?,Idk why but ibuprofen still works great for my cramps. I could take a fistful of pain meds my tolerance is so high to them but they are more recreational-NSAIDS actually do work for (my) pain. Give em a try. Take 800mg (4pills) with some food and see how you feel in an hour

Hope you feel better soon though, friend","thanks, appreciate it"
1601,Tapentadol?,It's like a stronger tramadol that you can abuse but not really binge on. It acts directly on opioid receptors as an agonist but it's also a NRI and to a lesser extent serotonin. This can lead to some shitty side effects if too much is used.

Adderal isn’t because it’s plain old vanilla amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, hence why it’s safe to use for ADD. It can be addictive sure but you know. 
Opiates don’t have any negative long term effects except decreased immune system/testosterone but those things are easily dealt with/treated and will reverse anyways after you detox and quit opes, though it may take some time. The real risk is impairment, say while driving, and overdose which if you’re getting legit pharma stuff is gonna be lower since it won’t be tainted and you can precisely dose it, as long as you start with low doses and only increase slowly over time.

You could use it once no problem. You could use as much as you want however often you want as long as you’re not taking more than you can handle, it is possible to overdose but it’s not the same as something like heroin (or straight up meth for that matter). It’s pharmacologically legit, it’s not supposed to be abused but if it was like meth it wouldn’t be a medicine. (They do actually have a prescription meth but that’s a while different deal lol). 
If you have been using adderall everyday multiple times a day for a year and you come off it you are going to go through withdrawals big time, mostly psychological. It wouldn’t even take that long to become dependent. And yes your tolerance will increase and you’ll have to take more until you’re past the point your own bodies production of epinephrine/norepinephrine and serotonin is enough to satisfy your nervous systems need for those kinds of stimulation and you become dependent on the drug for that response (meaning dependence and going without meaning withdrawals). You will have to increase your dose to keep your body satisfied, the pleasure will recede cause your body doesn’t care about that and you’ll find yourself just taking the meds to keep from withdrawing, if you don’t take them you won’t be able to function. So yeah eventually increasing the dose isn’t gonna do anything as far as a high is concerned cause your body will basically be maxed out as far as that sensation is concerned. 
Adderall is a mood/cognitive enhancer and opiates are mostly mood/emotion enhancers and analgesics. You can definitely take them at the same time and it’s awesome but there are risks when you start taking high doses of each. 
Taking opiates when you are feeling depressed is the greatest feeling ever (and I mean truly depressed), but that is a sure fire way of getting hooked and destroying your life. There is no greater lure than the relief of pain and no greater pain than heartbreak. That’s a Pandora’s box that you do not want to open. 
I wouldn’t expect you to find a doctor to write scripts for cash lol, you’d have to by them from other people. If you can verify with them that they are legit then that would be best. Your probably pretty good with adderall and the like cause they aren’t faked as much, but you need to be very careful about opiates unless you are absolutely certain that they came straight from the bottle. But yeah you’ll just have to buy them the way you do any other drug."

I wouldn’t expect you to find a doctor to write scripts for cash lol, you’d have to by them from other people. If you can verify with them that they are legit then that would be best. Your probably pretty good with adderall and the like cause they aren’t faked as much, but you need to be very careful about opiates unless you are absolutely certain that they came straight from the bottle. But yeah you’ll just have to buy them the way you do any other drug.","thanks a lot for all the info! i never knew adderall wasnt a sustainable solution, way i see it ill take it only before important exams etc (about 10 times in a year) and also once to test its effects on me ofc so that i dont screw up in my exam or even cause suspicion that im on drugs

way i see it opiates make you feel good but the next day they make you feel shit so you want to take them again? then id try them once as illegal drugs not as pills if thats possible without getting hooked, and ill keep on researching for other mood enhancers (like xtc and stimulants, weed works too)

and for daily usage ill use L-Theanine and Caffein with Ashwagandha and St. John's Wort if they work ofc (caffein in coffee really seems to work)

Anyway that's about all the info I needed to learn, thanks a lot again dude! Who knows if it wasn't for you maybe I was hooked to Adderall"

You can use it recreationally but it is addictive so you have to be very careful. People use it for academics and studying all the time, most don’t get hooked but it absolutely does happen. 
Opiates are definitely more addictive, and no they don’t make you feel shitty the next day. No hangover whatsoever, that’s part of the appeal/danger, no bad feeling :) but also no lesson the next day like with alcohol :(. I drank last night and my hangover helps keep me from doing that very often at all. The only time you feel shitty after opiates is when you’re dependent and so you feel shitty all the time in the first place unless you’re taking them, so that’s not the opes making you feel bad but rather your dependence making your default state terrible. 
I’m a little confused by what you mean by try them as illegal drugs versus pills, if you don’t have a prescription then pills are illegal too and if by ‘illegal drugs’ you mean street drugs then that would mean heroin and that’s a No No No. Absolutely try them as pills, though you will have to acquire them illegally just any other controlled substance. 
The bigger risk for dependence will always be with opiates but they are amazing so I can’t say you should never give them a try. But do do pills, H is a whole different beast."

i never knew there was such difference with oxy and h, could you elaborate maybe? are their effects the same? there isnt a better feeling than saying ive tried h so i dont wanna give up so soon"
1651,"well i assume adderall's effects are different than that of amphetamines or meth? if so, would using them just once to try hurt? or can i go more often like once a month or whatever? 

as for adderall how addictive is it, like whatd happen if i wanted to stop taking it after using for like a year also does it increase tolerance that i cant bypass with increasing my dose

i take it that adderall as cognitive enhancer and opiates as mood enhancer? can i take both together? otherwise id just keep both in my stash and take opiates only when im feeling bad

edit: i cant really find any prescriptions so buying it the way i buy illegal drugs seems to be safer than trying to find a doctor that can write fake prescriptions, i know it might not actually be from the pharmacy but ill try to find the most trusted seller, thats all i can do yes?

i know thats a lot of questions thanks a lot for the explanation too really appreciate it","I’ll respond when I get off work, I’m running deliveries like crazy lol"

Much just starting out so when i first started cud get a nice buzz off of 10-40mg depending on how high I wanted to get but nowadays since my baseline tolerance has risen it don’t matter how long I’m clean I would prolly have to do atleast 30-60mg just to catch a very minimal buzz."
1675,How many mg of oxy codon to get a nice buzz with little to no tollerance?,Start with 20 and take more if you want
1676,So that combination isn’t dangerous in that amount?,Depends on each person. IMO I would drop the xanax and just stick with the oxy and booze. So yes it could be dangerous.

2 hours for ER.

1723,Your love life?,"Copied and pasted again: 

I’ll start. So I’m a young fellow, 19 years old. I haven’t been in a relationship since high school which was long term and good and bad. And thanks to opiates (or better yet myself for abusing them), I haven’t had many sexual encounters since because of low sex drive and low motivation to be social. However as some may know I met a girl at my friends birthday party about 2 weeks ago and we’ve been talking everyday since. I really like her and it feels great to put myself out there again. She is beautiful and there’s something different about her. I thought maybe it was just me being excited but even my friends said they saw something special between us, so we’ll see. But we hung out alone for the first time last Saturday night and we planned on going out and doing stuff but she ended up just coming to my place and sleeping over, and we had a great time! And since then it’s going good, planning on going out this Saturday. So that’s what it’s looking like for me :)"

My SO and I have been married for about 5 years. She knows about, tolerates, and sometimes support my use. I have a lot of demons that I need to work on with a professional but until I can afford it, I self medicate with opiates. SO is very understanding about my use and doesn't mind at all. I pay all our bills and let SO use their money for whatever they want so I can use all my disposable income for opiates. At this point I've been off 30s and stronger for about 4 -6 years and now stick to 10s or weaker with the occasional 15 to treat myself.

I don't really get high before work except for when I'm passing kidney stones and then all bets are off.

I work for several doctors but I'm hesitant to see them and attempt to get opiates even though they know about my issues (back pain from an old car wreck, hip pain from a congenital defect, and like I said the occasional kidney stone), I'm very hesitant to ask as I don't want to be seen as a drug seeker and am not really patient enough to milk the visits until I could get what I want. I get a little closer everyday and there's one particular doctor that it very friendly and I suspect as long as I could pass a piss test I believe she'd write me whatever I wanted eventually. 

I used quickfix fake piss to get the job so I'm not so concerned about passing the drug test I just don't want to be labeled a drug seeker, especially at the office I work in.

Any advice as to what to say or do to get a script is welcome."

I work for several doctors but I'm hesitant to see them and attempt to get opiates even though they know about my issues (back pain from an old car wreck, hip pain from a congenital defect, and like I said the occasional kidney stone), I'm very hesitant to ask as I don't want to be seen as a drug seeker and am not really patient enough to milk the visits until I could get what I want. I get a little closer everyday and there's one particular doctor that it very friendly and I suspect as long as I could pass a piss test I believe she'd write me whatever I wanted eventually. 

I used quickfix fake piss to get the job so I'm not so concerned about passing the drug test I just don't want to be labeled a drug seeker, especially at the office I work in.

Any advice as to what to say or do to get a script is welcome.","Jealous of your ability to work the onion fields, I don't have the balls or the brains lol"
1728,"Jealous of your ability to work the onion fields, I don't have the balls or the brains lol","Takes more balls than brains and not that much balls honestly. Just encrypt your address on your own, do your research on vendors and try to pay in monero and you're good.

Remember just because you receive drugs in the mail doesn't mean you asked for them. Keep a clean house and a cleaner computer and so long as you're ordering small quantities to use and not enough to sell, you're as good as gold.

Almost forgot to mention, never order international, that's a major red flag. I've even received a love letter from customs thanks to a sloppy packing job by a friend from a legal weed state and I've since spent over a thousand dollars on empire alone. Shit I feel safer ordering there than copping face to face these days."

1730,"That would be my issue cause I'm in a far out country that doesn't even have an opiate problem cause no one sells it, gotta find sympathetic doctors and that is HARD after 5 years.

IMO that means, pay in monero, encrypt your address on your own hardware (not through the markets auto encrypt option), shop with vendors who have good reviews and don't order from hot countries like the Netherlands. I'm from the US and am considering ordering from Canada currently. I've never ordered internationally so I'm a bit nervous but by the end of the month when all my other plugs are tapped out, I may just roll the dice. As long as they can't prove anything on my end, the ops aren't gonna spend their precious little resources to prove I ordered 2 or three measly pills and besides, I didn't  :) this is all role play anyway right? Who would ever order drugs over the internet, if that were possible I'd say there would be thousand of packages per day that were drugs going all over ever country.

Either get you a burner Android phone that can be rooted, a burner laptop that will run some flavor of Linux or make a live bootable usb stick running TAILs and keep it somewhere where you can quickly destroy it if need be. Also never send your coin straight from an exchange to a market wallet. Always move it to a private wallet and preferably convert it to monero before spending it. Honestly though, I've bought directly from my phone, moved my coins from an exchange to a wallet and then to the market and had no problems. I've done that a few times. Not the best opsec but I'm no dealer, just a junkie trying to get my fix in the safest way possible."

If you are opiate naive, safe yourself the trouble of getting into it, i was a heroin addict for over 5 years shooting 1-2g a day, started with painkillers, dopesick and unable to afford pharmaceutical PKs, I switched to heroin out of desperation and never thought about a oxy or OC every again.

You want it to coat your sinuses but not drip down your throat. When it starts dripping down your throat you're basically just taking it orally. Do not spit out that drip lol, go ahead and swallow it because then at least you're not wasting. Just take them orally, on an empty stomach. Than a small fatty snack 30 min later."

1823,Also did I do it correctly lol?,"Yeah, sounds like it, although the straw an inch into your nose is too deep. The drug gets into your system via the membrane in your nasal cavity so you want it to stay in your nose and not down your throat.

Does it taste gross and how do you smoke it?
1828,How is it smoking oxy? Does it taste gross and how do you smoke it?,"I wouldn't smoke oxy, just chew it up and swallow tbh. Some people like to smoke it bc it hits faster but it doesn't last as long. If you smoke it you gotta put a tablet on a piece of foil and gently light it from underneath until it heats up enough to start releasing smoke, inhale through a rolled up piece of foil, let the tablet run down the foil and keep chasing it with the lighter and straw. I'm sure someone can explain better bc I never fucked with smoking shit it's too wasteful if you don't know what you're doing."
1829,How is it smoking oxy? Does it taste gross and how do you smoke it?,"When I used to do oxy I would always smoke it. I liked it better, it hits harder & more quickly. Put the pill on a piece of foil (shiny side down) and put a lighter flame under it so that the very top of the flame is under the foil, just enough to heat the pill to the point that it starts sliding when the foil is angled down a little toward you. As it slides, smoke starts to come off of it, and you can use a pen barrel or something to suck up the smoke. A lot of people say smoking pills is super wasteful but I liked it. I’m a little skeptical about it making overdose any less likely though."
1830,Did I snort correctly?,"With oxy, the drip is fine bc of oral bioavailability. Keep it in, swallow it, whatever... H is a little different. Try to go like 3/4"" in and angled to the inside of your nose. Dont really a snort but just breathe in normally through that side of your nose. It needs to stay in the mucus membranes for better absorption. Aka, the less drip, the better.  Stay safe"

Lost my job, had to go on welfare and eventually got on SSDI. About 5 yrs later my very compassionate pain dr at the time told me my only option left was pain Ms but I'd never get the dosage I need, only a fragment of it.

Incomplete cross tolerance is something clinicians account for in clinical practice when performing opioid rotations.

Which is why I said by day 3 he'd be in trouble and suggested he keep taking at least a small dosage. But Subs dont really work on the ratio you're describing where the dosage is that clearly and definitively tied to the percentage of receptors covered...suboxone varies pretty widely, where 2mg is shown to have a 30 - 60% coverage and 60 - 90% at 8mg or higher. The ceiling being 16 mg for most but not all people. If subs are in your system then they bind tightly to the mu receptor and block other opiates from *fully* binding. There is always a small percentage of the receptor not covered, even in ""full"" daily doses. The trick is, if there is at least a percentage of bupe that's bound to the receptors, you shouldnt go into full precipitated wds because the bupe is already at least partially bound. That's why I suggested that he maintains at least 2mg in his system at all times and induce slowly to gradually return to full dose.

1939,Is there any actual proof that PWD is worse/more intense than regular WD?,"It’s a lot worse; I would have died from it if I didn’t go to the hospital when I did bc I had severe renal failure. In my experience, it wasn’t noticeably shorter. 

But since pwd is caused by the opiates being rapidly kicked off your receptors, rather than allowing them to metabolize normally and leave the receptors more gradually&slowly, I would think you might skip over the usual time spent leading up to full withdrawals. So instead of going through the period of like 12 hours (maybe less) where you’re not really super sick but you still don’t feel great, you just get put in full withdrawals right away, which feels even worse than if you did it regularly bc it’s so shocking to your system.

Idk, it’s not really the same as like putting all the withdrawals into a shorter time period to make it more intense but get it over with sooner, you’d just be skipping the very beginning if anything. And the physical recovery for me actually took a lot longer bc my body was so fucked up from going through such a shocking experience, I was super weak and couldn’t walk up the stairs for a month."

Guess I need to just lay off the speedballs. 

Curious though, cops would need a more legit reason to knock on someone's door other than just a random calling and claiming there are drugs in someone's house, right? Seems like anyone could call and claim anything if that weren't the case."

Yeah I learned that the hard way....Before then I'd not had much experience with being on the wrong side of the cops, besides having drugs on me everyday for the past 15 years, I'm pretty law abiding.

Anyway...I got arrested in a hotel room once because an ex called them on me and told them I had drugs. When they knocked, my dumbass panicked and let them in! With a pile of dope and rigs laying all over the bed no less. That is still by far the dumbest fucking thing I've ever done in my life.

1962,What happened?,"I got my ass locked up for 5 days and kicked a 2 gram a day habit cold turkey in a med unit cell alone. Almost died because they forgot about me and I had no food or water the whole time. When you're puking for days with no water, it gets dangerous. They had to take me to the ER to give me IV fluids before they could out wheel me out in front of the judge for my bail hearing.

Ended up pleading guilty, getting drug court, passing drug court and getting 2 felony counts restricted on my record, which was fucking lucky considering how much I had on me. The cops did me a solid and wrote that I had less than a gram of each. Over a gram on either and I wouldve been looking at distribution charges. Scary shit. I mean...I  guess not scary enough because I'm still in the game."

1964,Rig size for begginers ?,"Ask at the pharmacy in like a cvs or Walmart for 31 gauge, 8mm (5/16”), 1mL (1cc) insulin syringes. This is exactly what it says on the package, so it would be easy for the pharmacist to find. They come in packs of 10 or a box of 100. You can order them online too. 

A lot of people like the longer tip ones (1/2”), but esp if you’re just learning how to do it, the shorter needle would be less intimidating and easier to hold without going right through the vein."

1970,What it like getting Vivitrol?,"If you're serious about stopping and getting clean, it's a great tool. I was on it for about 4-5 months and it helped a lot. I didn't really have any side effects, and there wasn't really a bump on my ass after the shot. Like I said, if you wanna stop using, it's great. It definitely helps with cravings, but doesn't push them away completely. I was on suboxone for about 2 months, 8mg, a day, and I had ZERO cravings for dope. 

Another good option is the sublocade shot, it's basically suboxone extended release. I personally think it's the superior option. Most rehabs/detoxes really push Vivitrol, because they profit from it heavily and it does help. 

Overall I think suboxone/sublocade is the better option."

I would still recommend Sublocade though, it’s the best of both worlds betweeen Vivitrol and Suboxone.

My personal experience, I got no cravings while on subs - since it’s still a partial opiate, it tickles that receptor of my brain just enough to not have cravings. In fact, if the thought of using dope ever came up in my head it wouldn’t even “click” or trigger me, it disgusted me. I’m off subs now, and still am disgusted by heroin, such a nasty and dirty drug. And all of the fentanyl going around, people are guaranteed to die if they keep using. I know a girl who has OD 6 fucking times and just doesn’t get it. Sad shit."

They tried to talk me into Vivitrol in rehab and I said ""Fuck no... I'm not going to willingly put an opioid antagonist into my body"" as I have painful fibromyalgia and opioids help with that so I'm not going to make the best painkillers I use completely ineffective. lol xD

1981,What it like getting Vivitrol?,"I haven’t gotten it, but I know plenty of people who have. Apparently is a little over $1k/ month without insurance... but your state detox might provide it for free given you go through their program. 

A lot of people that get it are surprised by the lump that forms on their butt after from the shot itself... supposedly goes away over time but I’ve heard people bitch about it more than once.

I have one friend who was allergic to it. Like it made her break out in hives and she had flu like symptoms for a while. Generally they put you on naltrexone pills for a few days before to see if you are going to react poorly to it, since they are basically injecting you with naltrexone.

In terms of cravings, I’ve heard people say it helps just KNOWING that it’s pointless to even try to get high bc it takes so much to overcome the blocking effects of opiates and alcohol."

With having only a week I think you are better off going cold turkey. One week isn’t enough time for a taper to actually decrease the suffering of opioid withdrawals. It might actually prolong the process because your week of “tapering” you will probably be withdrawing during much of that if you are aggressive with your taper. 

In the medical field, for people who have been on opioids for a while (think a year or more), many of us taper at 10% decreased total daily dose per MONTH. If the use is shorter term, weeks or months, then sometimes the dose can be decreased by 10% per week depending on the patient tolerance to mild withdrawal symptoms.

I would recommend going cold turkey if what was mentioned is your only option.  Have you been through w/d before?  Do you have any comfort meds or access to bupe?",None unfortunately i just relapsed anyway i guess sobriety is not for me. Thanks for everyone's help anyway its genuinely appreciated.

2060,300mg codeine taper?,The wd cold turkey is tolerable. In a week you’ll just be anxious and restless. You’ll feel physically better but staying off after that is an effort. If you have a week off just stop. 5 days later you’ll be feeling better. 7 days later going to work will be ok. It’s doable. Any more free time and you’ll think you can get back in it.

Using 3 to 5 days of methadone or subs to kick with no acute withdrawal symptoms only works with short-lasting opiates like heroin or oxy. It does not work with subs -- you can't use 3 to 5 days of methadone to kick subs.

>Do you mean, that 3-5 days of suboxone and then quitting, will eliminate most wds? And who’s that guy you tagged? Lmao. 

Yes. I mean that 3 to 5 days of methadone or subs at a dose that makes you feel normal -- same dose each day. 

That's it. If you do that, you will greatly reduce or even eliminate acute withdrawal symptoms.  

It won't help with PAWS, although you may not get PAWS. You'll probably be tired. But you won't have acute withdrawal symptoms  -- nausea, diarrhea, RLS, etc. It'll be pretty darn easy. 

>If that is true, I am truly happy - and thank you. This hasn’t been bad at all and I’m so happy for that. I still assume the worst is yet to come, but could the worst really be over?

This is what I am saying. 

I have used 3 to 5 days of methadone at a dose that makes me feel normal to kick heroin or oxy with greatly reduced or no acute withdrawal symptoms.

Friends of mine and people on this sub have used subs to do the same thing,  like the OP. 

I have not done this with subs.

Yeah -- because you're awesome! I don't know why people dispute this because they don't understand the science -- they aren't scientists and would not get it anyway!

You're not like that and I appreciate it. 

And it's not like our understanding of science doesn't change. We think we know how something works -- then it turns out we are wrong. 

So knowing THAT this way to kick works is, for our purposes, more important than knowing how it works.

I would recommend reading her articles, both by and about her. The thing that made this book so amazing for me is it helped me understand so much more about why people become addicted. 

She sees it as a learning disorder and it makes a lot of sense. 

FWIW, I am not sure you're an addict. Addiction is defined as compulsive behavior in spite of negative consequences. 

Does that describe you?

thanks for the links, ill check em out","Just to be clear, Szalavitz is not talking about a learning disability. She is talking about a learning disorder -- 

Szalavitz says:

""Learning disorders have a couple characteristics; one is they obviously involve learning. And addiction is defined as compulsive behavior despite negative consequences. Negative consequences is synonymous with punishment. It basically means you're failing to learn from punishment. So that is a problem with learning. The other thing that happens in learning disorders, they're usually restricted to a specific sort of brain circuit.""

Szalavitz says:

""Basically, addiction is love gone awry. You fall in love with a drug or activity rather than a person. That is the basis of why I think it's a learning disorder. It happens because 90 percent of addiction starts in adolescence or your early 20s.

When you fall in love, it completely changes your priorities and you might do some irrational and not well-advised things to make sure you'll be with that partner.

What happens in addiction is that reprioritization is now aimed at a drug rather than getting a person in your life.""

Oh and this is important! Szalavitz talks about why punishment does NOT work:

""There are two things here. We just said they have no brakes, so punishing them for having no brakes isn't going to create brakes. Second, we've just said addiction is defined as compulsive behavior despite negative consequences. So if negative consequences were going to fix it, it wouldn't exist in the first place.

It's also cruel and inhumane. The horrifying thing about our addiction-treatment system is we stigmatize and do tough love and put all this pressure on people with addiction who are trying to change and who often want to stop. But then we tell them the way to stop is to go to this center where people are going to scream at you and take away the only thing that gives you any comfort and try to humiliate you.""

2153,"hmm, interesting. my thoughts-

>""Learning disorders have a couple characteristics; one is they obviously involve learning. And addiction is defined as compulsive behavior despite negative consequences. Negative consequences is synonymous with punishment. It basically means you're failing to learn from punishment. So that is a problem with learning.

i disagree. i have learned plenty from my punishments. i have learned what not to do. i have learned what happens when you do those things.i have learned a ton about drugs, addiction, and all of it. its not that i never learned it. its that what i learned didnt matter to me, because dope mattered more. i dont think theres anytihng wrong with my learning. i think theres a lot wrong with my brain, my mental illness (which in large part stems from severe trauma), and the desire to escape myself and my life. i learned how to escape, so everything else were things i still learned but just disregarded.

>""There are two things here. We just said they have no brakes, so punishing them for having no brakes isn't going to create brakes. 

it might not create brakes. but when we do things in our addictions that are ACTUALLY wrong ( i dont mean bs like getting in trouble for possession which should be legal) like hurt our families, steal, lie, etc.. we need to face consequeneces regardless if it stops us or not. 

>Second, we've just said addiction is defined as compulsive behavior despite negative consequences. So if negative consequences were going to fix it, it wouldn't exist in the first place.

but we still need those consequences. and it does stop some people. read rock bottom stories. some people take 5,10, 50 tries or times of consequences before we decide to fix ourselves. but i  never wouldve fixed myself without consequences making me do so.

ive never had this happen. i went to a suboxone doctor who was very kind and used a pharmacy that was very kind and never was humiliated. when people give this attitude to addicts (im not at all excusing this, just explaining why i think it happens often) its probably largely due to how addiction has affected their own lives. how heroin OD killed their mom. how their junkie sister stole from them. how their dinner company stole their pills from their cabinet. etc. but sometimes yea its just from ignrance and thats wrong",">It's also cruel and inhumane.

well, this goes back to the legalization issue. which i already agreed with you on - it should be a thing. and when it comes to MAT in jail... its hard to consider how to address that . because i would support it if it included the adddict getting mental health help, attending groups, doing recovery work etc - but i wouldnt support it if it was just giving out opiates to people just bc theyre dependent, at the taxpayers cost, so they dont have to be sick while serving time for a crime they committed. and again, im talking about if drugs were legalized and ppl werent sitting there on nonviolent drug crimes like personal possession. but if a drug addict is in there for stealing or a dui etc and theyre withdrawing i dont think our tax money should be going to making sure that a violent offender or serious criminal gets to be comfy while they serve their time. 

>You think they should be denied drugs like methadone to help them kick. You've said it.

no i dont. ive said that i dont think primary care doctors should be required to treat addicts coming in for relief from their acute  WDs and then given methadone. people with any other specialized health condition has to see that particular specialist to get treatment and medication. addicts should have to do the same thing as everyone else does. which would be see an addiction specialist for their methadone. which is already available, at methadone clinics that are even covered by state insurance in many states. so no, im not denying them. im just not in agreement they should get special treatment over other people. if we change teh whole healthcare system for everyone, then sure. 

>You do. But you also judge them and think they deserve to suffer withdrawal because they brought it on themselves.

thats not judging them for being an addict.  that is not even saying they necessarily ""deserve"" it. but i mean... if i walk in front of a bus and get run over, maybe i didnt deserve it but i sure had it coming and knew what i was doing. same thing with addicts who know what happens when you get dependent on dope and then stop it, but still do it. they dont deserve suffering. nobody does except like rapists aand shit. i just meant that they brought it on themselves with their choices. and that if you play stupid games you win stupid prizes. 

>Saying something like that is pointless. It isn't telling the person anything he doesn't know. And it just shames him.

that was just a random, on the spot example i made up. idk. i dont shame addicts though, wouldnt in a professional  setting. but when addicts to shameful things how can they not expect to be judged and shamed by people for it? its not my place to shame them, so i dont and like i said i never would in a professional setting and dont een do so when speaking to them casually.

>I just think you need to understand that people don't deserve to suffer -- not addicts, not pain patients, not you.

youre right. but im not saying anyone deserves some horrific type of suffering. consequences for actions that were willingly made, knowing the consequences, is not suffering. withdrawing from heroin for less than even a week, while there are options out there to prevent that already, is not suffering. having to put in the work yourself to kick without a strong opiate handed to you so you can take a shortcut, is not suffering. suffering is going through something unfairly that you didnt bring upon yourself, that is cruel and unjust, that is torturous and usually done to you by someone else, imo. people dont deserve to suffer.

and personally i do think ive deserved to suffer in some ways. ive hurt people, stolen, committed crimes, lied and betrayed and fucked up other lives with MY addiction and those actions caused ppl to suffer. i dont think its wrong for me to have to suffer due to my own addiction when ive made other people suffer due to it. but i dont think i deserve to suffer like concentration camp style or anything.

for one, i have a severe mental illness that is currently untreated due to lack of access to medical care. im also a recovering addict, and im also a pain patient that has to self medicate my MAT + pain managment in order to make it possible. so i know how it is, how hard shit can be. but i also know that some parts were a choice, and i need to be  held accountable for it. 

i judge myself and lack forgiveness toward myself way more than others. its part of my BPD. i lack a sense of self at many times. i split on myself and others. i have unpredictable up and down swings. im in a lot of pain. im depressed and anxious. these arent excuses im making for myself, just explaining the headspace that what seems to be judgement and unforgivingness here comes from. 

but i dont judge other addicts for being addicts. i do judge some of their actions - the ones that deserve judgement. but id judge anyone for those things. i forgive addicts, and myself, but i still think that even when forgiven things arent and shouldnt be forgotten. 

and i know its not all over for me. it just feels that way at many times. because of the extent to which i ruined my life. its hard to not feel that way when ive been struggling to take even one or two steps forward without being tossed back twice as many steps, and dont know how to fix myself. 

i can turn my life around. but its gonna take a lot of time and right now i lack a lot of the options that exist to some other people but unfortunately not for me right now. its hard to feel like i can turn anything around when i worry where im gonna sleep, lack healthcare so i cant see my primary doctor or go to therapy or get physical therapy or even obtain my few (3) necessary meds for MAT/pain mgmt/mental stuff without doing it illicitly and expensively. and that last part means that im often unstable due to being up and down on wrong doses of meds or sometimes completely off one or more of my meds because i cant obtain them. hard to turn around when jobs wont hire me due to an out of state bench warrant, my credit is shot, and for  those two reasons i also get denied for housing. hard when it will take 5 grand just to clear my legal shit . hard when i live in a town where work is scarce to begin with and even after applying for 30+ jobs overall in other areas my shit car might not make it to, i still cant find work. hard when i realize why ppl resort to sellin drugs.  hard when my parents are sick and aging and 800mi away. hard when im in too much pain sometimes to walk or sleep so i cant function. hard when it seems like nothing is available as a rebuilding tool. etc. 

i dont believe ill age out of addiction. because 1) ill always need pain management. and 2) my BPD is there, its severe, and substance abuse is a huge symptom that comes with that. i wish id age out of my mental illness but since i believe really severe fucked up trauma at a formative age caused it, i wont age out. id need to work my way out. and im trying, as much as i can on my own. but i lack access to professional help so only so much ican do by myself.

I wouldn't listen to me, I really have no idea how long it takes for Suboxone to plant it's hook into ya.  People on here swear by it for short tapers to lessen withdrawals from other opiates.  

I honestly hope you don't have to experience much discomfort, if any.  I'd ask that you share your experience though later on, if you will.  If you can cut a 300mg/oxy habit with five days of Suboxone, then that is bad-ass."

2193,What dosages of methadone block the effects of opiates like heroin?,Iirc blocking doses of methadone start at like 80mg. But from my experience you can still feel dope on top of it but it'll take a good amount more than usual. I was able to get high on top of like 100mg methadone but once I was on 180mg daily there was no chance in hell of getting high on top of that.
2194,What dosages of methadone block the effects of opiates like heroin?,Methadone's blocking ability is due to the typical downregulation of the receptors due to repeated exposure not like buprenorphine's bitch ass raping the affinity space for your receptors from even one dose

2245,Smoking oxy?,"Personally i think the a215, k9, m30, v's and the t189 i believe smoke the best. The t's slide whole like the original ocs do. For the other ones, my technique is as follows:

Using a more sturdy tinfoil (the thin ones suck and get burned thru easily), get a rectangle piece like 8x6 long. With the shiny side down, smooth it on a flat surface.

Take a quarter pill to start with and place in the center. I crush it using the side of a lighter. Don't press to hard until you get the hang of it or it'll tear the foil/go flying.

After its crushed, take a card or butt of the lighter and spread the powder out in a thin line lengthwise. Doesn't have to be super spread out but you also don't want it so close together.

Pick it up from the side with both hands and crease the width sides a little so you kinda make a boat shape where the powder is. Doesn't have to be drastic but just a little.

To catch the smoke i use a crisp bill not rolled up too tightly as you want a bigger hole to catch the smoke.

Lighting it and grtting the technique down requires patience and messing up. Some people cough then blow all the powder off.

That all said i don't recommend smoking pills unless you have a bunch and are cool wasting some. Since i do a lot of coke my nose gets clogged and since i don't shoot and don't like eating them, i have to smoke them to ingest.

I considered it may be not enough citric but I'm also mindful of the amount of citric I use since it tears up your veins, and if I'm trying to get an insoluble cutting agent to dissolve then the citric acid I add won't react with anything and I'll be causing needless vein damage. I actually used powder coke for the first time in a shot last week and I was pleasantly surprised at how it instantly dissolved without me having to do anything, so much easier and hassle-free compared to using crack. It's a shame that in the UK every heroin dealer sells crack as well rather than coke and that I have to spend £80 minimum to get good cocaine whereas I can get .3 of good crack for £20."

In the former, I suppose if you slipped while tooting your oxy and smacked your nose on the table or something, yeah it could happen. Are we talking septoplasty bad, who knows. 

In the case of the latter, no.

It’s not a case of “burning” it’s a case of cocaine being a potent vasoconstrictor and causing localised ischemia and anoxic injury to the cells in the nasal mucosa, thereby causing necrosis and a great big hole in your septum. Hence why cocaine is still utilised by the otolaryngology guys in surgery. It’s brilliant at stopping bleeding through the aforementioned mechanism.

Also cocaine blocks Na+ channels in cardiac myocytes and elsewhere and prevents the cell from discharging an action potential. Hence why it works as a topical anaesthetic and makes your gums, numb (hey that rhymes!).

As a bonus fact (since I’m in a hotel room alone while my wife is shopping for a fascinator to wear to the races) if you want to know why you can get a “bell ringer” when you do a large dose of sweet, sweet cocaine, it’s because cocaine causes the release of Endothelin-1 which is a potent vasoconstrictor and it ALSO inhibits the release of nitric oxide (which is a vasodilator & opposes the action of E-1). 

The spiral modiolar artery in the ear, constricts causing a loss in the supply of oxygenated blood to your cochlear. It suffers damage from low oxygen and your ears start ringing as the cells die. 

But fortunately for you, cocaine (as we all know too well) has a short duration of action & before you know it, blood flow is restored (until you do your next line or shot). The same mechanism of injury occurs with opioids at supratherapeutic doses, hence why some people OD and wake up with tinnitus. 

The more you know, eh? 

Anyway, be good."

2256,"Deviated or perforated? 

In the former, I suppose if you slipped while tooting your oxy and smacked your nose on the table or something, yeah it could happen. Are we talking septoplasty bad, who knows. 

In the case of the latter, no.

It’s not a case of “burning” it’s a case of cocaine being a potent vasoconstrictor and causing localised ischemia and anoxic injury to the cells in the nasal mucosa, thereby causing necrosis and a great big hole in your septum. Hence why cocaine is still utilised by the otolaryngology guys in surgery. It’s brilliant at stopping bleeding through the aforementioned mechanism.

Also cocaine blocks Na+ channels in cardiac myocytes and elsewhere and prevents the cell from discharging an action potential. Hence why it works as a topical anaesthetic and makes your gums, numb (hey that rhymes!).

Most commonly, when it comes to insufflated drug use, perforated septum are usually tied to acidic drugs like cocaine.  Meth is also tough on the mucus membranes of the nasal cavity and nostrils, though its long duration = infrequent dosing; cocaine's high acidity and frequent need to re-dose is why it often makes holes in ppl's noses. 

Oxycodone can make a perforated septum.  Is it likely?  Hell no.  I'm sure you could experience issues with smelling, runny nose, maybe more, from snorting too much oxy."

I find my pain is starting to creep up and become worse and worse. I am currently lying on several ice packs, and will take a hot bath to combat. Ugh, I hate being in pain.

2293,Anyone else in the same boat as me ? Feel like a alien,"Wow, I rarely read long posts on reddit but I could relate so fucking much to you. I am about to turn 20 and I feel so dejected and different from everyone, I feel like I have really lost it mentally over the last few years, basically once leaving high school and not being forced to interact with people I went into extreme isolation. 

My DOC is dextroamphetamine and even though they are two different drugs the way you described your first oxy experience sounds identical to my first adderall experience, I rememeber taking a blue 10 mg IR and waiting, I got on skype with my best friend at the time and we were talking and decided to play black ops 3, I remember the exact map and where I was when I started to feel it, I felt so good I could barely talk because I was smiling and laughing so much. I finally felt ok with myself and life, I said from that moment on I want to take this the rest of my life everyday. 

Well my mental health just got worse, severe depression and social anxiety. My using got worse and worse and I started taking benzos shortly after. During this time before going to my first rehab I didn’t know about addiction and was mindlessly going through life and drugs, at 16 I was on heroin and meth and went to first rehab. I would eventually get out and get back on drugs sometimes quick sometimes it took a few months. 

My anxiety was getting much worse every time I went through this cycle of quitting amphetamine and benzos, being in rehab suicidal, and feeling worthless. In 2018 is where shit got a lot worse, I tried IV meth and got so so fucking bad on it. I went to rehab for 5 months and it was the worst experience ever, my counselor manipulated and lied to me and I was trying to process stuff there but everyone was so hostile. I stayed closed off and then my parents said they wouldn’t let me live with them and only pay for my living if I went to a halfway house. So I went there. That was the most depressing time of my life, they didn’t enforce the rules there so I sat in my apartment for 3 months straight, I would only step outside to take drug tests or to go to driveway to get my groceries being delivered. I went so far into isolation, staying up all night sleeping all day so I didn’t have to see anyone, a lot of very negative thinking, so much social anxiety that I quit smoking cigarettes and went to vaping cause I couldn’t bring myself to smoke a cig outside because someone might look at me or talk to me.

I had a plan to kill myself in February 2019 there, I was going to go buy duster at Walmart and huff it sitting on top of an overpass and huff until I blacked out then fall into traffic below. Luckily I did not do that, I came across a website that saved my life literally (https://metanoia.org/suicide/)  almost all the anti suicide websites are government ran or have nothing that I haven’t heard before or nothing that gets to me, something about this website stuck with me and it felt genuine. I revisit it when I am in dark places. 

I got out of the sober house in end of February 2019, I was staying in my own apartment and things just got worse, I used prescription adderall to keep cravings away and help depression, I got my pc into my apartment and put black bedsheets over the windows, all I did was videogame for 3 months unemployed, I was clocking 110 hours a week of ingame time. Didn’t bathe , eat, clean my apt, or go outside. I got a job in retail eventually and the misery that brought was unreal. I felt such a sense of dread every morning going to work it was physically painful. I started fucking with research chemicals at this time and fell in love with them, I was paying 80$ for the equivalent of 2000 xanax bars in RC benzos, I got to try drugs i never had access to before. And it all shipped to my apartment I didn’t have to deal with people or the illegal activities. I got really strung out on clonazolam (rc benzo). What led me into treatment was a very heavy bath salt binge and very bad delirium, 10x worse than any meth psychosis I’ve had. 

It feels so weird, my memory is so shit I do not remember most the stuff I do in a day, the 3 months I spent in sober living and the 7 months I spent in that apartment I couldn’t tell you anything I did, it is all a blur. Conversation with people feels more and more foreign, to the point where I am afraid to speak to people. I spent 20 mins having to talk myself into going over to a group of people in my current halfway house and just smoking cigs with them because my anxiety is so bad. I don’t eat much at all it feels like a chore, I never feel hungry I just feel pain eventually and have to eat something until pain goes away. I am 3 momths sober and I just isolate here and do not interact with people, I play videogames all day, I got black sheets over my windows, I basically am living the same depressing life I was before I am just sober now. I am so sexually frustrated because I know I will never be able to approach someone I like much less have sex and with them, this is sad to think but I have never had sex without being on amphetamine/meth or benzos, I don’t want to be an incel. 

I hope it isn’t like this my whole life, I want so desperately to find connection with other people but so scared. I am doing stepwork though and hoping to get some relief in that."

i think these meds - all 3 of them - are best used for MAT purposes. even if short term of just a few months. or longer, if needed. acute withdrawals can be the easiest part of quitting, its staying off thats hard not getting off.

But I absolutely do think they should be used short term to get people off heroin or oxy, etc. They are used that way in certain rehabs and detoxes, but really -- it should be protocol and available from every doctor. 

I had a non-drug-using friend who was hospitalized for a few weeks and I went to see him the day after he got out. He told me he was scared he had caught some weird illness in the hospital because now that he was home everything smelled bad and he felt hot and cold and achey. I asked him if he had been on pain medication while in the hospital. 

Yes.

He was kicking and didn't know it.

Why not just give people like him a few days of methadone?

>acute withdrawals can be the easiest part of quitting, its staying off thats hard not getting off. 

People say that, but how many people stay high because they are scared of kicking? If it were easier, it wouldn't be such a big deal. Also, I don't think anyone should have to suffer when we have a way to ease suffering. 

Going cold turkey has never kept anyone I know clean."
2306,"IMO its harder to use kratom as a fast taper off of opiates. you have to dose it multiple times a day. it becomes harder to lower that frequency/amount and stick to it.  at that rate, why not just use your opiate of choice and taper with tht? a lot of ppl end up staying on the kratom i feel like, versus using it as a fast taper. which is fine - but still has its risks. 

i think these meds - all 3 of them - are best used for MAT purposes. even if short term of just a few months. or longer, if needed. acute withdrawals can be the easiest part of quitting, its staying off thats hard not getting off. PAWS is worse in ways than acute WDs, and the actual recovery part is hardest. this is just my opinion tho",[deleted]
2307,[deleted],yeah i cant disagree with it being up there on the list of all the shitty things about kicking. it can be really bad for some ppl and lead to relapse.
2308,What's your opinion on Kratom for quitting opiates?,"It's amazing for getting off dope and IME really good for maintenance. Helps a lott with cravings and such for me, I'll still dabble with h here and there but I NEVER  shoot anymore (I can't) and I dont feel like I have to keep using, can just jump back on kratom after a few days with little pain. I really don't wanna be like how I used to be so it's mainly kratom now and short binges. 

Its not perfect sure, but it sure as hell beats spending alll my $ on dope and being in that hell of withdrawal when the $ runs dry."

Eh, can you prove that? Suppressing information that can reduce human suffering is not good. We should be able to make our own decisions. If clinics are suppressing this, I'm sure it's all about the money. And social control.

i dont disagree. but right now look were the US is at. pain patients cant even get meds for their conditions, i cant walk into a doc and get any amount of methadone for my pain and i think that your idea is valid and should be how it is but i also think that pain patients being able to walk in and get methadone should come before addicts strolling in being handed it to them. if CP people cant even get opiates - let along strong ones like methadone - from a doctor, why should addicts be able to? right now we get cut off our opis w no taper, so its a pipe dream to think that addicts will be able to walk in and ask for opis to help them get off their drug addictions. just my opinion.

>Why would they take a few days worth of methadone if they didn't want to quit?

why do people break their own hands and go to the ER to get opiates? becuse they want to get high or unsick 

>And who cares if he's only clean for ten days and starts using again?

>At least he didn't suffer.

WHAT? who cares if someone gets clean but doesnt stay clean, as long as they didnt stuffer the one single week they were clean? isnt the goal ehere when getting clean to stay that way? so how in the world can we just say who cares what happens past their acute WD timeline - as long as they didnt suffer thru it! 

>People should not have to suffer.

people have to pay the piper. people who choose to start using drugs and who choose to shoot dope etc. should deal w the consequences of that. these people are suffering beccause they chose to suffer. i dont agree really that there needs to be a cop out available so junkkies dont have to hurt while withdrawing from the heroin they chose to use. play stupid games win stupid prizes. 

>. I am not saying this is necessarily a way to be clean forever. I'm just saying it's a way to bypass acute withdrawal symptoms. That's it.

whats the point of bypassing that if youre not gonna stay clean anyway? 

>Suffering cold turkey never kept any of us clean -- and it's not physically healthy.

no it didnt keep anyone clean, but its part of the process when you use e a drug like that. and using drugs isnt physically healthy withdrawing from them is no more unhealthy than their drug use. i dont want ppl to suffer either but its how it is. people should know that when you become a junkie youre gonna have to suffer. thats all

also, these ppl can still go to a clinic and get methadone for 3 days then stop. or they can buy subs to take for 3 days. buy kratom. etc. there are ways to get those things if they need them. 

and i get why you shared it. its just that the article loses its credibility when the author goes on, just sentences below, about how they are free at last and whatnot after one week. beating acute WD is not kicking a habit. kicking a habit means kicking it and keeping off it. otherwise we may as well just be discussing ""how to get clean for like a week and then who cares whats next lol"""

I am all for that! 

>i dont disagree. but right now look were the US is at. pain patients cant even get meds for their conditions,

I know. But what does that have to do with this? If anything, the idea that no one deserves to suffer would help pain patients get the meds they need.

>but i also think that pain patients being able to walk in and get methadone should come before addicts strolling in being handed it to them. 

We can and should do both at the same time.

Everyone should be able to. 

>right now we get cut off our opis w no taper, so its a pipe dream to think that addicts will be able to walk in and ask for opis to help them get off their drug addictions. just my opinion.

We need to work for it. Look at all the pipe dreams that have come true.

>why do people break their own hands and go to the ER to get opiates? becuse they want to get high or unsick 

Exactly! That's why they should be able to get methadone on demand. So that doesn't happen. 

>WHAT? who cares if someone gets clean but doesnt stay clean, as long as they didnt stuffer the one single week they were clean?

Yep. People should not have to suffer. And since people put off getting clean because they are scared of the kick,  it makes sense that more people would try to get clean if it weren't so scary. More people try -- we'll probably have more people succeed. And any clean time is safer than none.


> isnt the goal ehere when getting clean to stay that way? so how in the world can we just say who cares what happens past their acute WD timeline - as long as they didnt suffer thru it! 


>people have to pay the piper. people who choose to start using drugs and who choose to shoot dope etc. should deal w the consequences of that.

Why? Ask yourself that. Really ask yourself that.

Why?

People are using drugs because they are suffering. How will making them suffer more help?

What is our goal here? To make people suffer or to help them get clean?

I know what my goal is.

As for dealing with the consequences, they have!! And that is NOT a good thing. It doesn't help. So why should we make it harder when they want to start a new life?

>whats the point of bypassing that if youre not gonna stay clean anyway? 

Who cares? People get clean perhaps because they need surgery. They don't intend to stay clean, but so what? Better to have them get clean and stay healthy for surgery.

I am choosing the thing that is most likely to keep people alive.

Cold turkey doesn't make people stay clean and fear of it keeps them from getting clean. 

>but its part of the process when you use e a drug like that. 

It doesn't have to be. 

>and using drugs isnt physically healthy withdrawing from them is no more unhealthy than their drug use.

That depends and that is definitely not a reason to force people to go cold turkey.

> i dont want ppl to suffer either but its how it is.

No. I don't know what you mean by ""how it is.""

> people should know that when you become a junkie youre gonna have to suffer. thats all

People know that. And what good has that done? None. When they want to get clean -- we should do everything we can to help. Hindering it clearly has not worked. 

>also, these ppl can still go to a clinic and get methadone for 3 days then stop. or they can buy subs to take for 3 days. buy kratom. etc. there are ways to get those things if they need them. 

I know. But it should be common knowledge and legal protocol. 

As for the article losing its credibility, the fact that a junkie doesn't understand HOW something works doesn't matter. 

The fact that he knows that it works does.

We were raised in a punishment-oriented society, so I don't blame you for thinking people need to pay the Piper. We were taught that. It feels normal.

And look how it has worked -- or hasn't. 

Hell, I read something about arresting teenagers who trick or treat. Wtf?! Punish, punish, punish.

It's bullshit. 

People who are hurting and not hurting anyone other then themselves should not be punished. No one should have to suffer, certainly not people who are suffering already."

because drugs are bad. drugs ruin lives. drugs have risks. people know this. people still choose them. why shouldnt there be a consequence?

nobody is making them suffer more. most of those ppl suffering ran to drugs before they ran to try and get help for their demons or whatever. i feel for those suffering and the stuff that leads ppl to use, but *nobody else* is making them suffer more. they  are suffering because they did heroin. there are already options available that make it easier. why do we need to spoon feed addicts a totally painless way out of what they signed up for?

are you forgetting how much the majority of addicts DO hurt other people? not just themselvves. so many innocent bystanders and loved ones get hurt by addictions that arent even theirs. nobody is making addicts suffer. nobody is making them do drugs. nobody is even punishing them except the nature of their bodies. if you take a drug that causes WD, youre gonna WD. if you cant or wont utilize the handful of options already there, you cant blame other people for your suffering when you put the needle in your own arm"

No, I'm not. I'm saying we can do more. Do you know when France made it legal for any doctor to prescribe suboxone, overdose rates fell by 79% -- yes, 79%!! -- in just four years? We need to do that. 

But we don't. And part of that is because people think addicts should suffer. And worse.

Ah! That's the War on Drugs propaganda. I don't blame you for thinking it. It seems normal. We were raised on it.

But people used to say the same thing about masturbation. About homosexuality.  The exact same things you just listed.

Alcohol and tobacco are bad. They ruin lives. They have risks. People still choose them.

But there is no consequence like the ones drugs users face. No jail or prison or utter contempt, the idea that they deserve bad things. None of that.

But that idea exists for drug users, as it used to for homosexuals.

Question it. QUESTION IT! We were all brainwashed by propaganda. 

>most of those ppl suffering ran to drugs before they ran to try and get help for their demons or whatever. 

So? That doesn't mean they have to suffer more. And it's not like it's easy to find help.

We are, when we think they deserve to suffer.

That's not the only reason. Heck, if heroin were legal, like in Switzerland or the UK (the British System), they wouldn't suffer from doing heroin.

> there are already options available that make it easier. why do we need to spoon feed addicts a totally painless way out of what they signed up for?

Why not? We want fewer addicts, right? And why use terms like ""spoon feed."" It's just help for people who need it.

>why should we make it easy peasy on people who ruined their own lives?

Because building a new life is hard, but that is what we want. Fewer addicts. Better lives for everyone. Do you know addiction rate goes down when heroin is legalized?

>are you forgetting how much the majority of addicts DO hurt other people? 

Legalize it and watch that change. Again, I refer to the article about the British System. 

What is better for families? And addict in prison or an addict in something like the British System or like what they do in Switzerland?

And what is better -- a parent kicking for a week or a parent able to take care of work, the house, the kids?

If you really want things to be better, you need to accept that all this punishment, all this War on Drugs crap, does NOT WORK. Not for anyone. 

We need to stop demonizing, stop dehumanizing, start helping. You say there is plenty of help, but there isn't. What there is is expensive or has waiting lists or is ineffective.  And shame and fear prevent people from asking for help.

Again with the ""punish."" We need to get rid of that idea. If it is not okay to punish drug addicts, then it sure as hell won't be ok to punish pain patients.


of course i know theyre the excuse mostly. but in some ways they are part of the cause. people using pill mills without needing them just to get the drugs, just as guilty as the doctors prescribing. people who go in faking pain to get opiates because they are sick or whatever, make it harder for people with real pain to be believed. otherwise i agree tho

and im not saying we should ""punish"" addicts. im just saying there are already options available for them to use to get off drugs. if they cant/wont, then they are punishing themselvs and theyre punishing themselves going through WD in the first place because they knew what heroin does. nobody else is punishing them by making them have acute WD. just their own body, which they willingly put drugs into. 


>Of course they are. Hell, they get incarcerated. Jail. Prison. For nothing more than being addicts. Part of that whole punishment crap.

oh of course i agree here. i just didnt think thats what we were discussing. i thought we were just talking about WD. trust me i agree on this, and personally can relate to this one sadly

>It doesn't have to be the price and it is wrong that people think addicts should suffer.

>That's how they justify pain patients suffering.

the only suffering i meant was valid and is paying the piper is going thru WD if you do drugs. thats all, nnot the other suffering like legal issues etc. why shouldnt WD be the price, i mean they chose to abuse these drugs that cause WD. they made themselves suffer as far as WD goes. 

pain patients are an entirely diff story. pain patients are suffering not because we should pay the price for having pain and needing the medicine that was designed for pain - not getting high. i dont think these two points are related personally

>From a doctor's office. Three to five days worth.

there are places that cater to this though. why should GP's have to do this, too? addiction docs treat addiction. not GP's. 

and related question - should there be a 1 time limit on this if they did use this policy? or if that addict keeps failing should they be able to keep goin to doc for these methadone scripts? 

i also just cant help but view this from a personal angle, maybe biased maybe not idk... but a drug addict comes in withdrawing and wnats to skip acute WD, doc should give them 3-5days methadone. pain patient comes in barely functional, sent out with naproxen or some bullshit and told that we cant get opiates unless we have cancer. but addicts can have strong ass opiates. thats like a wtf thing to me

>No, I'm not. I'm saying we can do more. Do you know when France made it legal for any doctor to prescribe suboxone, overdose rates fell by 79% -- yes, 79%!! -- in just four years? We need to do that.

i agree. wouldve saved me grief when i asked my gp for it

>But we don't. And part of that is because people think addicts should suffer. And worse.

maybe a bit of yes and no. there are plenty of suboxone doctors. plenty of methadone clinics. kratom. whatever. addiction treatment is a specialist type thing - just like pain management is. i dont see the problem with addicts having to go to addiction specialists when people with other specialized issues have to go to specialists, too. 

>Ah! That's the War on Drugs propaganda. I don't blame you for thinking it. It seems normal. We were raised on it.

i think it because its true. and because ive lived it. its normal to think heroin addiction ruins lives because it fucking does, not because propaganda

>But people used to say the same thing about masturbation. About homosexuality. The exact same things you just listed.

addiction is not comparable at all to these things. masturbation and homosexuality actually dont hurt others. drug addiction often ends up doing so, though. 

>So? That doesn't mean they have to suffer more. And it's not like it's easy to find help.

and going thru acute WD is not making them suffer more. it isnt always easy to find help your right, but many of  thesee people never even try. they self medicate their issues with drugs not meant to and then blame everyone  else for how they  suffer


i agree with legalization. i never disagreed with it. but right now its not legal here, so i was speaking based on how it is here. not how it should be. and i also was refering almost entirely to acute WD because thats the comment i was ressponding to. didnt know you were including legaliztion and whatnot in your points. i agreee with those. 

>And what is better -- a parent kicking for a week or a parent able to take care of work, the house, the kids?

a parent shouldnt be parenting when they have a drug addiction bad enough to make them that sick. blame the parent for the fact that they are sick, not the system

>We need to stop demonizing, stop dehumanizing, start helping. You say there is plenty of help, but there isn't. What there is is expensive or has waiting lists or is ineffective. And shame and fear prevent people from asking for help.

>We need to make changes and more punishment is not the answer.

i agree on this. wasnt ever disagreeing. i support legalization but i dont see it happening, so i am speaking based on current legislation and whatnot.

2334,">C'mon. If I know one thing about you it's that you are smart. Drug addicts are just the excuse. The fall guy. They're not the real reason.

Again with the ""punish."" We need to get rid of that idea. If it is not okay to punish drug addicts, then it sure as hell won't be ok to punish pain patients.


of course i know theyre the excuse mostly. but in some ways they are part of the cause. people using pill mills without needing them just to get the drugs, just as guilty as the doctors prescribing. people who go in faking pain to get opiates because they are sick or whatever, make it harder for people with real pain to be believed. otherwise i agree tho

and im not saying we should ""punish"" addicts. im just saying there are already options available for them to use to get off drugs. if they cant/wont, then they are punishing themselvs and theyre punishing themselves going through WD in the first place because they knew what heroin does. nobody else is punishing them by making them have acute WD. just their own body, which they willingly put drugs into. 


>Of course they are. Hell, they get incarcerated. Jail. Prison. For nothing more than being addicts. Part of that whole punishment crap.

oh of course i agree here. i just didnt think thats what we were discussing. i thought we were just talking about WD. trust me i agree on this, and personally can relate to this one sadly

>It doesn't have to be the price and it is wrong that people think addicts should suffer.

>That's how they justify pain patients suffering.

the only suffering i meant was valid and is paying the piper is going thru WD if you do drugs. thats all, nnot the other suffering like legal issues etc. why shouldnt WD be the price, i mean they chose to abuse these drugs that cause WD. they made themselves suffer as far as WD goes. 

pain patients are an entirely diff story. pain patients are suffering not because we should pay the price for having pain and needing the medicine that was designed for pain - not getting high. i dont think these two points are related personally

>From a doctor's office. Three to five days worth.

there are places that cater to this though. why should GP's have to do this, too? addiction docs treat addiction. not GP's. 

and related question - should there be a 1 time limit on this if they did use this policy? or if that addict keeps failing should they be able to keep goin to doc for these methadone scripts? 

i also just cant help but view this from a personal angle, maybe biased maybe not idk... but a drug addict comes in withdrawing and wnats to skip acute WD, doc should give them 3-5days methadone. pain patient comes in barely functional, sent out with naproxen or some bullshit and told that we cant get opiates unless we have cancer. but addicts can have strong ass opiates. thats like a wtf thing to me

>No, I'm not. I'm saying we can do more. Do you know when France made it legal for any doctor to prescribe suboxone, overdose rates fell by 79% -- yes, 79%!! -- in just four years? We need to do that.

i agree. wouldve saved me grief when i asked my gp for it

>But we don't. And part of that is because people think addicts should suffer. And worse.

maybe a bit of yes and no. there are plenty of suboxone doctors. plenty of methadone clinics. kratom. whatever. addiction treatment is a specialist type thing - just like pain management is. i dont see the problem with addicts having to go to addiction specialists when people with other specialized issues have to go to specialists, too. 

>Ah! That's the War on Drugs propaganda. I don't blame you for thinking it. It seems normal. We were raised on it.

i think it because its true. and because ive lived it. its normal to think heroin addiction ruins lives because it fucking does, not because propaganda

>But people used to say the same thing about masturbation. About homosexuality. The exact same things you just listed.

addiction is not comparable at all to these things. masturbation and homosexuality actually dont hurt others. drug addiction often ends up doing so, though. 

>So? That doesn't mean they have to suffer more. And it's not like it's easy to find help.

and going thru acute WD is not making them suffer more. it isnt always easy to find help your right, but many of  thesee people never even try. they self medicate their issues with drugs not meant to and then blame everyone  else for how they  suffer


i agree with legalization. i never disagreed with it. but right now its not legal here, so i was speaking based on how it is here. not how it should be. and i also was refering almost entirely to acute WD because thats the comment i was ressponding to. didnt know you were including legaliztion and whatnot in your points. i agreee with those. 

>And what is better -- a parent kicking for a week or a parent able to take care of work, the house, the kids?

a parent shouldnt be parenting when they have a drug addiction bad enough to make them that sick. blame the parent for the fact that they are sick, not the system

>We need to stop demonizing, stop dehumanizing, start helping. You say there is plenty of help, but there isn't. What there is is expensive or has waiting lists or is ineffective. And shame and fear prevent people from asking for help.

>We need to make changes and more punishment is not the answer.

i agree on this. wasnt ever disagreeing. i support legalization but i dont see it happening, so i am speaking based on current legislation and whatnot. 

i guess i just have a lot of opinions leaning toward fixing the pain managment issue in this country before fixing the addiction issue. but thats a personal thing. i wasnt an addict until the way pain patients turned us into addicts and criminals. so im gonna fight for easy access to things like methadone from a doctor for pain before i fight for access to it for addicts who just want to beat their withdrawals. nobody gives a fuck when pain patients withdraw on top of their pain, or offers us a 5 day methadone script, or any help. 

i support all help for addicts and want to go into that industry actually, however i just really disagree with the attitude i see sometimes here that make it seem like addicts are suffering and its someone elses fault, they deserve opiates to get high meanwhile ppl in pain cant get them for real reasons, and the disregard for the choices addicts make and bring upon themselves but are unwilling to take any responsibility for.",">of course i know theyre the excuse mostly. but in some ways they are part of the cause. people using pill mills without needing them just to get the drugs, just as guilty as the doctors prescribing. people who go in faking pain to get opiates because they are sick or whatever, make it harder for people with real pain to be believed. otherwise i agree tho

This all should be LEGAL. We don't have an opioid crisis. We have a Prohibition crisis. 



There are very few options for addicts to get off drugs and what we have often doesn't work. NA, rehabs have a 90% fail rate.

And addicts who can't or won't get off of drugs do not deserve to suffer through withdrawal when they decide to get clean.

Suffering doesn't help.

Letting them suffer is punishing them. 

>the only suffering i meant was valid and is paying the piper is going thru WD if you do drugs

No. There is absolutely no reason for it. None. It doesn't do any good. 

>pain patients are an entirely diff story. pain patients are suffering not because we should pay the price for having pain and needing the medicine that was designed for pain - not getting high. i dont think these two points are related personally

Again -- you think addicts deserve punishment. 

For what?

Start questioning that idea. Really. As I already said, I don't blame you for having it. We have all been brainwashed by the War on Drugs. 

But question it. Remember there are people who think AIDS is God's punishment on homosexuals and that they should suffer. I'm sure you know what bullshit that is. It's bullshit when it comes to drug addicts, too.

>there are places that cater to this though. why should GP's have to do this, too? addiction docs treat addiction. not GP's. 

Remember when I said before that France was having a huge overdose crisis, so they made it so all doctors could prescribe suboxone, not just certain doctors? And the death rate from overdose fell 79% in just four years?

That's why. 

>and related question - should there be a 1 time limit on this if they did use this policy? or if that addict keeps failing should they be able to keep goin to doc for these methadone scripts? 

No time limit. It takes as long as it takes. Remember  -- we want to keep people alive. We want to help people stop being addicted. We don't want people to suffer. And punishment is counterproductive and pointless.

I know it's hard to get out of that mindset  -- that we should punish and control, that it's right to do so -- but it's not right. It doesn't help.

>i also just cant help but view this from a personal angle, maybe biased maybe not idk... but a drug addict comes in withdrawing and wnats to skip acute WD, doc should give them 3-5days methadone. pain patient comes in barely functional, sent out with naproxen or some bullshit and told that we cant get opiates unless we have cancer. but addicts can have strong ass opiates. thats like a wtf thing to me

Ih, both people should get exactly what they need. The addict should get methadone and the pain patient should get oxy or whatever. 

And don't you see that if we saw addicts differently, there would be no way to use addiction as an excuse to deny opioid painkillers to pain patients? 

>addiction treatment is a specialist type thing 

Again -- France. And a doctor giving methadone to a patient does not prevent that patient from seeking additional treatment, if he needs it. He may not. 

>i think it because its true. and because ive lived it. its normal to think heroin addiction ruins lives because it fucking does, not because propaganda

Did you read the link about the British System? When heroin was prescribed by doctors, lives were NOT ruined. Same thing in Switzerland. Oddly enough, addiction rates when down. Some people prescribed heroin actually stop using and whether they did or not -- their lives got better. They weren't ruined.

>addiction is not comparable at all to these things. masturbation and homosexuality actually dont hurt others. drug addiction often ends up doing so, though. 

But it is -- people felt the same way and said the same things about masturbation and homosexuality as they do about addiction. 

Heck, people got locked up for homosexuality. It was a crime. It ruined lives -- but it wasn't the homosexuality that ruined lives. It was societal attitudes and laws.

>and going thru acute WD is not making them suffer more. it isnt always easy to find help your right, but many of thesee people never even try. they self medicate their issues with drugs not meant to and then blame everyone else for how they suffer

Yes, it is making them suffer more. Making people suffer when they don't have to is, well, making them suffer.

If these people want to get clean, they ARE trying. So help them!

If they're self medicating  -- give them better medicine!

Don't say they deserve to suffer. Don't let them suffer. What good will that do?

>a parent shouldnt be parenting when they have a drug addiction bad enough to make them that sick. blame the parent for the fact that they are sick, not the system

So why are you standing in the way of making it easier for the parent to get clean?

>i guess i just have a lot of opinions leaning toward fixing the pain managment issue in this country before fixing the addiction issue. 

Why not do both at the same time?

>but thats a personal thing. i wasnt an addict until the way pain patients turned us into addicts and criminals.

Addiction is defined as compulsive behavior in spite of negative consequences. If you're not doing that, you're not an addict. 

> so im gonna fight for easy access to things like methadone from a doctor for pain before i fight for access to it for addicts who just want to beat their withdrawals. 

Why not fight for it for both?

>nobody gives a fuck when pain patients withdraw on top of their pain, or offers us a 5 day methadone script, or any help. 

Nobody gives a fuck when addicts do either. No one offers them 5 days of methadone, either. 


>i support all help for addicts and want to go into that industry actually, 

I really like you. You are a good person, a smart person, but I don't think you should go into the addiction field until you realize addicts are not the ""other,"" until you understand that they do not deserve to suffer, until you understand that suffering and punishment won't help. 

When you understand that  -- you'll be AMAZING!



>however i just really disagree with the attitude i see sometimes here that make it seem like addicts are suffering and its someone elses fault, 

Who have I blamed? Everyone is suffering and no one should. 

>they deserve opiates to get high meanwhile ppl in pain cant get them for real reasons,

All reasons are real. And absolutely no one thinks addicts deserve opiates. They think addicts deserve to suffer. Heck, you think that, good as you are, yet you still think it.

> and the disregard for the choices addicts make and bring upon themselves but are unwilling to take any responsibility for.

Again, until you let go of this attitude of blame and punishment and judgment when it comes to addicts, don't go into the field of addiction.  I believe in you. I know you are smart and have a good heart. I don't blame you for being brainwashed at all. I was, too, once upon a time. 

I have every faith your natural intelligence and goodness will lead you to see that these attitudes about punishment and blame are wrong, are counterproductive.

Depends on their insurance coverage either thru job, parents if they're under 26, or if their state offer state ins thru medicaid or not. Only 19 (ithink that's number) states don't have medicaid extended. Thats still not a good % but it's less than half at least. 

Otherwise, there aren't very few options. There's rehabs. IOP. Methadone clinics. Suboxone clinics. SMART meetings if you aren't into NA.

>And addicts who can't or won't get off of drugs do not deserve to suffer through withdrawal when they decide to get clean.

Why not? They knowingly did drugs that have WD symptoms. They don't *deserve* It maybe but they shouldn't expect a magic exemption 

>Suffering doesn't help.

It doesn't. But if you make bad choices you suffer. 

>Letting them suffer is punishing them. 

How so? They put the drugs in their body. Why is it someone else's job to rescue ppl from their own self destruction. Who is punishing them? Who is making them suffer? Why are others being blamed for addicts suffering when the addicts are the ones doing drugs that have sufferable consequences? 

>No. There is absolutely no reason for it. None. It doesn't do any good. 

Not everything in the world does good. The reason people suffer from WD is because they do drugs that cause it. But God forbid we ever blame the addict lol

>

>For what?

What punishment am i implying th3y deserrve ? The punishment of WD for the drugs they put in their own body. 

>Remember there are people who think AIDS is God's punishment on homosexuals and that they should suffer.

Those ppl are ignorant. AIDS happens when anyone, homosexual or not, engage in unsafe sex or needle sharing. 

>No time limit. It takes as long as it takes.

So they can go every 2 weeks and get methadone handed to them and maybe use it right or maybe get clean, that's ok? I hope you at least dont expect someone else to pay for those visits lol

>Remember -- we want to keep people alive

>We don't want people to suffer.

So why are people in pain getting Tylenol while recreational users apparently should get methadone? If we're gonna help addicts we need to help the ppl that the system turned into addicts, or arent but have their lives fucked up due to lack of meds, too 

>Ih, both people should get exactly what they need. The addict should get methadone and the pain patient should get oxy or whatever. 

Why does tje addict get better meds than someone in real physical pain lol? Just because they like to get high they deserve a better script or?

>But it is -- people felt the same way and said the same things about masturbation and homosexuality as they do about addiction. 

Just bc ppl said it doesnt mean it's true. It's a fact that addicts harm other more than gays and people that jerk off. 

>Yes, it is making them suffer more. Making people suffer when they don't have to is, well, making them suffer.

But WHY shouldn't ppl have to suffer for bad choices they knowingly made? Who is forcing them to suffer ? Nobody makes them us dope. Nobody makes them not seek other treatment. Acute WD is nothing in terms of suffering compared to what many addicts do to make their loved ones suffer. If they can't handle a few days of sickness they cant blame anyone else when they are the ones making these choices.  

>If these people want to get clean, they ARE trying. So help them!

There IS help. But when you use heroin physical detox is just a result of it and if they wanna get clean they can put in the effort to get thru that and shouldt expect someone to help them skip withdrawal. That's just nuts. Its like taking all blame off addicts as if they are the victim for having withdrawal they brought on themselves..

>If they're self medicating -- give them better medicine!

Who? Opiates are better medicine ror for opiate addiction ? No, imo. If theyre self medicating they need mental help not strong shit like methadone 5o drown out their issues 

> Don't let them suffer. What good will that do?

They let themselves suffer.  Why is it other ppls responsibly to make sure ppl sticking needles in their arms don't suffer ? It does no good , but again - why are we not blaming thr addict at all??

>So why are you standing in the way of making it easier for the parent to get clean?


I'm personally not at all. I'm not the one refusing ppl help. I'm in no one's way

>Why not do both at the same time?

We should. 

>Addiction is defined as compulsive behavior in spite of negative consequences. If you're not doing that, you're not an addict. 

Yeah, I was. I'm recovering now 

>Nobody gives a fuck when addicts do either. No one offers them 5 days of methadone, either. 

Addicts can go to clinics for help. Its not like they don't exist. Pain patients can't go to pain clinics and get nearly any opiates. 

Also, idt it's comparable. Most pain patients didnt choose their pain. I didn't choose for a car to run me over. Addicts aren't victims to ther addictions tho. Nobody ran them over with a needle and made them a junkie. I agree we should help both. But I don't think the groups compare. Addicts shouldn't be getting stronger scripts than ppl in pain, there are more maintnance and addiction treatment options available now thn pain mgmt treatments. 

And im going into tje field to counsel. Not to hand out meds to people. I think addicts need consequences for their choices and to be held accountable. Id be a shitty counselor if i coddled them and told them they're the victim and should suffer none for any of what they've done etc. 

If you get addicted to a drug u jnow will make u WD, then expect to WD unless you go to a clinic. If you steal or commit crimes in you4 addiction, expect to suffer the consequences. If you choose to self medicate and not seek mental help in any way, you shouldn't expect a free pass when you aren't happy with your 5 days of acute WD. Etc. I think ppl should deal w consequences for what they've done is all. Nobody Is punishing them for addiction alone (unless legal issues), and WD is punishment from your body for putting drugs in it. Nobody is responsible for that but the user. 

>When you understand that -- you'll be AMAZING

Thank you though. Although like I said I plan to counsel. Give HR info and resources. I help ppl with Suboxone, tapering etc. I answer questions for safe use. I help support ppl getting clean if they put in the work. But I'm just not gonna tell ppl that their suffering isnt fair if they caused it. That doesn't help. That breeds lack of accountability and responsibility etc.

>veryone is suffering and no one should. 

Why shouldn't ppl suffer for poor choices? How would anyone ever learn?

>They think addicts deserve to suffer. 

I dont. I just think that withdrawal comes with use. If that's unfair suffering then I guess the worlr has no consequences

>Again, until you let go of this attitude of blame and punishment and judgment when it comes to addicts, don't go into the field of addiction. 


I'm not blaming addicts for anything except their poor choices. I blame myself for mine too. I only brought up blame bc you made it sound like someone else in the world is to blame for addicts suffering. I don't want to punish anyone. I don't judge addicts. I am one. But some of our actions SHOULD be judged. We do awful shit often. It isn't excusable. I include myself tho and don't judge anyone for being an addict. 

Anyway thanks for the compliments tho!!"

But WHY shouldn't ppl have to suffer for bad choices they knowingly made? Who is forcing them to suffer ? Nobody makes them us dope. Nobody makes them not seek other treatment. Acute WD is nothing in terms of suffering compared to what many addicts do to make their loved ones suffer. If they can't handle a few days of sickness they cant blame anyone else when they are the ones making these choices.  

>If these people want to get clean, they ARE trying. So help them!

There IS help. But when you use heroin physical detox is just a result of it and if they wanna get clean they can put in the effort to get thru that and shouldt expect someone to help them skip withdrawal. That's just nuts. Its like taking all blame off addicts as if they are the victim for having withdrawal they brought on themselves..

>If they're self medicating -- give them better medicine!

Who? Opiates are better medicine ror for opiate addiction ? No, imo. If theyre self medicating they need mental help not strong shit like methadone 5o drown out their issues 

> Don't let them suffer. What good will that do?

They let themselves suffer.  Why is it other ppls responsibly to make sure ppl sticking needles in their arms don't suffer ? It does no good , but again - why are we not blaming thr addict at all??

>So why are you standing in the way of making it easier for the parent to get clean?


I'm personally not at all. I'm not the one refusing ppl help. I'm in no one's way

>Why not do both at the same time?

We should. 

>Addiction is defined as compulsive behavior in spite of negative consequences. If you're not doing that, you're not an addict. 

Yeah, I was. I'm recovering now 

>Nobody gives a fuck when addicts do either. No one offers them 5 days of methadone, either. 

Addicts can go to clinics for help. Its not like they don't exist. Pain patients can't go to pain clinics and get nearly any opiates. 

Also, idt it's comparable. Most pain patients didnt choose their pain. I didn't choose for a car to run me over. Addicts aren't victims to ther addictions tho. Nobody ran them over with a needle and made them a junkie. I agree we should help both. But I don't think the groups compare. Addicts shouldn't be getting stronger scripts than ppl in pain, there are more maintnance and addiction treatment options available now thn pain mgmt treatments. 

And im going into tje field to counsel. Not to hand out meds to people. I think addicts need consequences for their choices and to be held accountable. Id be a shitty counselor if i coddled them and told them they're the victim and should suffer none for any of what they've done etc. 

If you get addicted to a drug u jnow will make u WD, then expect to WD unless you go to a clinic. If you steal or commit crimes in you4 addiction, expect to suffer the consequences. If you choose to self medicate and not seek mental help in any way, you shouldn't expect a free pass when you aren't happy with your 5 days of acute WD. Etc. I think ppl should deal w consequences for what they've done is all. Nobody Is punishing them for addiction alone (unless legal issues), and WD is punishment from your body for putting drugs in it. Nobody is responsible for that but the user. 

>When you understand that -- you'll be AMAZING

Thank you though. Although like I said I plan to counsel. Give HR info and resources. I help ppl with Suboxone, tapering etc. I answer questions for safe use. I help support ppl getting clean if they put in the work. But I'm just not gonna tell ppl that their suffering isnt fair if they caused it. That doesn't help. That breeds lack of accountability and responsibility etc.

>veryone is suffering and no one should. 

Why shouldn't ppl suffer for poor choices? How would anyone ever learn?

>They think addicts deserve to suffer. 

I dont. I just think that withdrawal comes with use. If that's unfair suffering then I guess the worlr has no consequences

>Again, until you let go of this attitude of blame and punishment and judgment when it comes to addicts, don't go into the field of addiction. 


I'm not blaming addicts for anything except their poor choices. I blame myself for mine too. I only brought up blame bc you made it sound like someone else in the world is to blame for addicts suffering. I don't want to punish anyone. I don't judge addicts. I am one. But some of our actions SHOULD be judged. We do awful shit often. It isn't excusable. I include myself tho and don't judge anyone for being an addict. 

Anyway thanks for the compliments tho!!","

>Otherwise, there aren't very few options. There's rehabs. IOP. Methadone clinics. Suboxone clinics. SMART meetings if you aren't into NA. 

Let me clarify -- there are few effective  options for addicts.  Rehabs -- all rehabs -- have a 90% fail rate.  So does NA.

MAT is your best bet, but still -- it reduces mortality by 50% in recovering addicts, but we as a society need better. 


>Why not? They knowingly did drugs that have WD symptoms. They don't deserve It maybe but they shouldn't expect a magic exemption 

We ALL do things we know have bad consequences. Should we beat a kid who falls off a jungle gym we told him not to climb? If a person is skydiving and has an accident, do we not bring them to the hospital?

Look -- if people truly believed no one deserved to suffer -- addict or not -- that would HELP pain patients, not hurt them. 

>Not everything in the world does good.
If you want the world to be good to you -- be good to others. If you don't want the world to dismiss or ignore your pain, make a world where doing that to anyone is unthinkable. 


>The reason people suffer from WD is because they do drugs that cause it. But God forbid we ever blame the addict lo

What good will blaming addicts do them or you? Has this attitude helped pain patients AT ALL? No. In fact,  it's hurt them. It's used against them.

>Those ppl are ignorant. AIDS happens when anyone, homosexual or not, engage in unsafe sex or needle sharing. 

Just like withdrawal happens to addicts and pain patients alike.

>So they can go every 2 weeks and get methadone handed to them and maybe use it right or maybe get clean, that's ok? I hope you at least dont expect someone else to pay for those visits lol

Why do you think they would? I am curious about that. And since less that 2% of Americans have even tried heroin, much less become addicted, I have no problem paying for this as part of universal healthcare. 

>So why are people in pain getting Tylenol while recreational users apparently should get methadone?

Again, if our society embraced the idea that no one should suffer, pain patients would get opiate pain medication. 

Recreational users DON'T get methadone, btw. That's a problem. If they did, if it weren't a problem, if it were done in a doctor's office, what would be the problem with giving opiates to pain patients?

There'd be no problem. 

> If we're gonna help addicts we need to help the ppl that the system turned into addicts, or arent but have their lives fucked up due to lack of meds, too 

I keep saying this. Over and over. It's like you don't hear it.

If NO ONE deserves to suffer -- then no one deserves to suffer. And if addicts don't deserve to suffer, then obviously pain patients don't. 

You ever been treated like an addict? Did you like it? You seem to think the answer is to make a division between pain patients and addicts.  How's that working out?

My answer is to make it unthinkable for ANYONE to suffer. If it's not okay to treat addicts like shit, then it's not okay to treat anyone like shit.

I keep saying the same thing to you. Just try to consider it."

2442,Closed Eye visuals on H?,i've experienced some serious closed eye visuals while being fucked up on H. i've also done a similar combo to what you're talking about. only difference was i was much more opiate naive so it was just tussionex at the time. but man i felt trippy as fuck. it was awesome though. i loved it. i hate to say it by mixing drugs that aren't usually mixed can be fun as fuck. albeit stupid as hell unless you have a tolerance to said drugs.
2443,Closed Eye visuals on H?,"The very first time I tryed H, when I was like 15, thought I was hardcore! 😂 Smoked half a £20 bag and every time I closed my eyes I saw loads of skulls and crossbones with triangles around them, flashing like a disco, flying through my eyes(coming at me and going right through).

Never had anything like that happen since though and I'm 35 now, been on and off that shit more times than I'd like to acknowledge!"

Kratom is great for this - but remember it’s addictive as well. If I were in your shoes I’d buy 50 grams and reduce the dose every third day. Like 10,10,8,8,6,6,3,3,1,1 or even just jump off after 3. You could even do it at a quicker rate than that like 10 the first day, 8 the second, 4 the third, 4 the fourth, and so on.

I would avoid subs unless you have a history of chronic relapsing. Your history of use doesn’t seem extremely bad and I think it’s a good idea you putting this behind you now. Smart move"

Only the occasional day here n there where nothin was happening and i had to actively make somethin happen.

For like the first 8 years using id have like 2-4 people call to taje them tocmy dude and id get crazy deals where they were better off goin thru me and splitting the half or gram with me. Or i have been on subs for like 80 monthly scripts and 3 a day is 40-50 bucks per day. (but i always went for the ""pickup script of 90 subs then sell 10-20-30 asap for only 10 each, then after 1.5-2 weeks im down to 3 subs to make it the next 2 weeks...""

I had guys to sell gift cards to for more than the crappy 50% that most stores and gift card machines paid.  I worked at a butcher shop the first 5 years using and i had a guy i could snag some steaks chops sausages hamburger patties etc from the freezer and he'd buy a box of frozen meats for like 100 bucks. Had a guy that would buy.

Its not really a ""work a regular job then when you end up broke and sick one day, then just ""get ur hustle on one time"" type of a thing"". In my experience its almost like a job in itself. More of a daily thing where you put in the work getting numbers of people that wanna buy things. Or meet people in your daily life that dont have a car or plug. But then those people arent gonna wait 4-8 hours till after ur done workin."

It really wasn't uncomfortable at all. I would dose small amounts of sub, then a bit after do my dope on top of it. I didn't get high anymore from the dope really , but it kept me from sickness and i felt as normal as you can expect to really. 

With Bernese you dont really have to wait, id start at the beginning of a new day tho and have a tentative schedule in mind to follow. It depends what you're using, but id plan to slowly induce over 5 days or so and really if possible it's ideal for all the dope you use during the time to be from the same batch so you can have more accurate dosing.

With a 5 day plan, the idea is to slowly induce small amounts of bupe alongside your dope while decreasing your dope intake by 20% per day til u hit 0. 

You have the right concept in mind but the bupe doses youre thinking of using are too high and increase too fast. 

Here lets say you use 1g dope per day. So then day 1 take like 0.125mg bupe, then 0.8g dope.. day 2 0.25mg bupe then 0.6g dope.. day 3 0.5mg bupe then 0.4g dope.. day 4 0.75mg bupe then 0.2g dope.. day 5 1mg bupe and drop the dope. Then start increasing your bupe as needed, id recommend 1-2mg more Every 2 hours until you feel reasonably comfortable.

Yes that's why you induce the bupe slowly in Micro amounts to letit build up in your system. By the time you reach 1mg, you'll be dropping the dope anyways."

Nah, cause you've been building up bupe in your system. 

If you're at 12hr mark and only mildly sick that sounds too soon to induce yet

You have enough dope to Bernese with. Even if your starting point was 19 bags. And you. Could increase your bupe slightly faster thab my example Ive given ppl, because your using so much dope it'll override it and therefore you can get to 2mg instead of 1mg by day 5imo..

With the amount you have plus that fear I could extend it to either a 7 or 10 day schedule that work up to 2mg bupe gradually nd you'll be golden if done right. Esp if 10 days. But its up to you if you have tb3 willpower to stick to schedule and are willing to spend a week or 10 days on the transition"

2607,Why do I never feel better after taking subs? Am I causing mild precipitated wd bc of this fent dope I always use?,"I have given up trying to start subs ever since i was on subs for 2.5 years then relapsed on dope for 3 days in like 2016. Ever since that relapse i have tried to take 4mg or 8mg and even a small 1-2mg piece, and its pwds every single time.  even at 80hours clean i still got mild-moderate pwds for ~6-7 hours the last time before i gave up. In the first year after that 2016 relapse i had tried like 15-20 times before eventually losing my job. Subutex also Did the exact same thing as suboxone .

Subs used to work perfectly at 12 hours clean for the first ~6-8 years using 80mg oxy then 40mg opana per day. Then ~ a half gram of dope per day

Towards the end of my opana use then dope use (like 7-10 years into usijg), i started taking sub at like 18-24 hours clean and i would feel like 50% dopesick for a day and laid in bed or on the couch, then day 2 on subs id feel feel okay enough to eat and move around.

Then i actually started taking my subs and didn't relapse for 2.5 years. For about 2.3 of those years i was strictly shooting 0.5mg iv at 8am then another 0.5mg iv when i got home from workin 9-10 hours fixing cars. (I shot it because it lowered the half life from the sublingual 35-70hour half life down to intravenous ~7 hour half life. This meant that i could feel each shot spread out every 12 hours. Id start to feel sick by 8am and start to feel sick again by the 8pm shot.

When i relapsed at 2.5 yrs on subs, there was already starting to be fent mixed into the ecp heroin. This was around 2015-2016. I did notice over the years it got harder and Harder to get on subs, but since 2105-16 i just can not take any bupe.  I have dozens of pwd experiences and it got to where id buy a half gram of dope just to wait 24 hours,take 2mg or less bupe then get pwds starting and do a fat shot of dope to stop the pwds. There's almost nothing worse than waiting 36+ hours till youre sick as fuck then take a tiny 1-2mg of sub, then lay there waiting for 10-20 mins and sure as shit you start getting the hot/cold sweating, horrible feeling that you cant even just lay there cause its so bad that all you can do is get dope somehow to stop the pwds.

I think its a combination of subs working less over time, and these fent analogues just last too long like methadone does. I distinctly remember this one time a few years ago. I was getting the same tan fire dope for 6 months and was positive for opiates(heroin morphine) and ""fent"" analogues. I used then went to bed, woke up and waited all day to get sick enough to take sub. At 11pm(24 hrs clean) i didnt feel sick enough and actually still slept moderately well, woke up and had an 11am appointment and finally started getting sick during the trip to the appointment. Got home and took a tiny piece of sub and got pwds....

I know carfentanil has an 8-9 hour half life and that's like 3x longer than heroin/morphine.  Not sure about the other fentalogues like furanylfentanyl acetylfentanyl sufentanil flourofentanyl etc etc. These fent analogues are prettymuch brand new and have no info. Carfentanil is only known because its been used on large animals"

(I shot it because it lowered the half life from the sublingual 35-70hour half life down to intravenous ~7 hour half life. This meant that i could feel each shot spread out every 12 hours. Id start to feel sick by 8am and start to feel sick again by the 8pm shot.

When i relapsed at 2.5 yrs on subs, there was already starting to be fent mixed into the ecp heroin. This was around 2015-2016. I did notice over the years it got harder and Harder to get on subs, but since 2105-16 i just can not take any bupe.  I have dozens of pwd experiences and it got to where id buy a half gram of dope just to wait 24 hours,take 2mg or less bupe then get pwds starting and do a fat shot of dope to stop the pwds. There's almost nothing worse than waiting 36+ hours till youre sick as fuck then take a tiny 1-2mg of sub, then lay there waiting for 10-20 mins and sure as shit you start getting the hot/cold sweating, horrible feeling that you cant even just lay there cause its so bad that all you can do is get dope somehow to stop the pwds.

I think its a combination of subs working less over time, and these fent analogues just last too long like methadone does. I distinctly remember this one time a few years ago. I was getting the same tan fire dope for 6 months and was positive for opiates(heroin morphine) and ""fent"" analogues. I used then went to bed, woke up and waited all day to get sick enough to take sub. At 11pm(24 hrs clean) i didnt feel sick enough and actually still slept moderately well, woke up and had an 11am appointment and finally started getting sick during the trip to the appointment. Got home and took a tiny piece of sub and got pwds....

I know carfentanil has an 8-9 hour half life and that's like 3x longer than heroin/morphine.  Not sure about the other fentalogues like furanylfentanyl acetylfentanyl sufentanil flourofentanyl etc etc. These fent analogues are prettymuch brand new and have no info. Carfentanil is only known because its been used on large animals","It really sucks that they're cutting this stuff into the ecp and making it so much harder for people to get onto subs. And they also cause overdoses sometimes like what is wrong with just making money off heroin alone I don't fucking get it man like stop cutting this stuff in there.

Have your PWD ever been like puking bad? mine never get that bad but I get extremely anxious and restless every time I try to convert to subs. Have you ever tried something called the bernese method? I think I might try that or just go ahead and get on methadone as that will be much easier than waiting through days of withdrawal to get onto subs."

What you're describing just sounds like the normal crappy period of adjusting to the subs.  When you get pwds you can't even just lay there without shifting around every 10 seconds. Not to mention the complete misery.

I always assumed it was just normal to experience that when switching to subs but I think it’s some milder form of pwd

2617,"Dont say that, wtf. Mixing fent+ket with amphetamines would NOT make it any safer, dont do this!",It doesn’t make it healthier* but nmda antagonists like ketamine are counteracted by high dopamine levels and stimulants reverse opiod respiratory depression. I’ve seen heroin overdose reversed by amphetamine and cocaine multiple times. If he doesn’t wanna pass out  or black out amaamphetamine sure would help. Sure it’s no naloxone but I’m sure he doesn’t wanna go to a hospital and if he can type all this on reddit I’m pretty sure he won’t die. There really aren’t any super serious interactions between stimulants and depressants like a lot of people say.  But really fent only lasts an hour so it’s probably over by now.

One day, you’ll wake up and there will be something there where the will to stop will be stronger and you’ll have a desire to make an attempt. You’ll also have a touch of positivity when it happen. I know BC I went through a decade of the mindset you have right now. I always posed the question” Why bother with sobriety? Life is painful, boring, and miserable” I’m not saying I’m 100% in the clear. In fact, I myself and looking to clean up. But the the hope is there and the self destruct mode is way less than what it was before. I hope the best for you. It’s a tough life, that we lead. You’re brave and strong. Please know that. There’s always hope."

I have no doubt I would be in prison by now... I sold my mom’s fucking wedding sterling silver and college class ring over a rear ago, and she hasn’t noticed yet.

Firstly, there's hope. You can do better. You can repair your relationship with your family. It's possible to be a decent person. All of that begins with making a choice. A choice to clean up your act. You can make that choice. Not going to lie, it's hard as fuck. I wouldn't wish the hell of withdrawals on anyone, but if you ever want to get out of this dysfunctional cycle, you're going to need to go through withdrawals..

It's kinda like that saying goes, ""It's gonna get worse before it gets better,"" that's what withdrawals and early recovery are for me. 

Check out rehabs, NA/AA, and other groups like SMART Recovery if you are ready to make that choice to get off the painkillers."

really? thats awesome for u, im glad. ive seen people say it cost 1200$. many addicts dont have insurance tho. i cant get it rn so viv would be impossible. luckily, suboxone works for me

>I wasn't trying to be senseless just trying to guide people to a med that really works and you never havta be dope sick again.

the med (viv) works if you want it to.. but plenty of ppl try to break thru it and its very dangerous. people on MAT also should never be dope sick again if they taper off properly too

>ubs are wonderful for getting you off dope but really should only be used for a week and be a quick taper. That's my two sense.

whys that? some people need longer term maintenance. and also, there are plenty of addicts with overlapping pain issues. so thats a conflict for that group 

im glad viv works for you, sincerely. im not knocking it. just pointing out that it doesnt work for everyone, some ppl try to break thru it and its very dangerous to do so, some people cant afford it, etc. and some people just need maintenance meds. its diff for everyone so whatever works for each person i support

If someone is legitimately unconscious, then waking up with a sore eye is the least of their problems (and they’ll never know how they got it anyway) but if they’re pretending to be asleep or something as a way to malinger or get attention, then this will *instantly* wake them up/snap them out of it. 

The eye is pretty tough. But make sure their eyelid is closed and utilise a modicum of common sense. Try it on yourself and see if you couldn’t flinch if you didn’t know it was coming. It’s more aggressive than a sternum rub, but hey you gotta do what you gotta do."

* slow breathing or apnea (the involuntary holding of breath)
* deep guttural breath sounds, gurgles, prolonged punctuated snores. Usually people report the breathing of an OD patient as “sounding wrong”. Respiratory secretions can also build up so they’re breathing might sound “wet”, but not always.
* failure to respond to stimulus including yelling, light slapping, vigorous sternum rub, poking the soles of the feet, tickling, etc.
* grayish or bluish pallor (pale skin color)
* 🤮 
* clammy sweaty skin, but not always
* unusual body position for extended periods of time. Contortion. We’ve seen people hurt themselves from the positions they pass out in - serious side effects including damaged vertebrae, and other muscular problems. This isn’t part of the canonical OD symptoms but it should be.



**You should never use alone because you won’t be able to identify these on yourself**

The discussion on how to know between passing out and OD’ing is moot - you typically won’t know you are about to OD especially with IV. With snorting you’ll have more time but it still might be difficult. There are Apps you can put on your phone that can help protect you if you are using alone. I think some even use fit bit technology to monitor your vitals."
2804,"Help, how to recognize overdose?",I’ve never OD’d and I’ve been using for 8+ years but I’ve been to the brink and honestly it’s one of those things similar to dying I would assume where once your in it your in it. There is no realizing your overdosing and having time to call 911 or anything like that. If you’ve done too much your out like a light switch.

Once you reach 1/3 of your original dose, then slow the taper by half if you feel it appropriate. Then you’re good. 

But that’s just my experience with deprescribing."

2822,is fentanyl really as strong as some say?,"Incidentally, the reason fentanyl is so potent, is because of its lipid solubility and ability to cross multiple membranes, without a massive diminution in the amount of drug, that is left “on the wrong side of the fence” so to speak. We could delve into the pharmacokinetics of this, but some may find it interesting to note, that fentanyl really only has a moderately higher affinity for the Mu receptor than morphine or oxycodone for example. I believe it’s in the vicinity of 3-400%. 

In the same manner that buprenorphine has a higher binding affinity (Ki) for the Mu receptor than most full agonists, thereby displacing them or rather competing for receptor occupancy, and throwing you into PWD if dependent. Fentanyl is more attracted to the Mu receptor than morphine, but it’s not hundreds or thousands of times more (which is often what I hear and see bandied around the place). I also think people conflate binding affinity & intrinsic activity, with potency & its ability to induce an antinociceptive response in the target organism (you). 

The reason it’s considered far more potent than those two (micrograms as opposed to milligrams) is simply by virtue of its lipid solubility. 

Contrary to popular belief, transient and incidental contact with fentanyl, is not really an issue. For example, when you place a fentanyl transdermal patch on the skin, it takes about 8 hours before you actually begin to perceive the analgesic effects. 

That’s 8 odd hours of it being directly pressed against bare skin. It becomes an issue if you start throwing it around and inhaling it. Or handle fentanyl powder with bare hands and then pick your nose or something.

I fucking love codeine more than anything but it's so hard to get on the street I'm usually forced to by dilaudid which I dont even like because it always makes me sick. I could find fent dope easier than any rx too. Codeine is more euphoric than anything else for me. The discussion of phasing out codeine has been around for a long time though so I doubt it'll make a big comeback.

2867,"Can you maybe explain what that means in a smaller, simpler paragraph so my dumb ass can understand this better?","Sorry wasn’t meaning to sound cryptic. Some fentanyl analogues are literally classed as toxins they are upto 500-1000 times stronger than morphine, they shouldn’t even make them.

What I mean by the danger of fentanyl is, Opioids efficiency are measured by receptor affinity for mu, delta and kappa receptors generally (that is what provides pain relief). The respiratory and nervous system depression are what cause an overdose.

So fentanyl has a massive depressant effect, without huge binding affinity. Whereas say Oxy has high affinity, but barely any depressant properties relative to dose."
2868,Modafinil for withdrawals?,No es bueno.
2869,Modafinil for withdrawals?,"Bad idea!!! I have modafinil in my medicine cabinet right now thats gathering dust.. why? Because it induces such serious anxiety in me that when I take it, I end up trying to compensate by taking more bupe. It never works..but hey.. addict brain here! 


Modafinil works by inducing the activity of orexin a and orexin b,  which are hormones secreted by the hypothalamus to regulate sleep.  It is also a very weak dopamine/norepinephrine agonist.  You certainly do NOT need to be kept awake during withdrawal and nor do you need to take anything and causes more norepinephrine to be available!! 


Stay away from stims during withdrawal.  Some folks seem to think that they work great, but thats the rare exception.  Not many people truly enjoy feeling their skin crawl, with restless legs, sweats and all that jazz and even less people enjoy having those feelings while all jacked up on something that increases those effects."

2904,How often can you use opiods without gaining a tolerance?,"Realistically you should be able to use opioids 1-2x per week without ever becoming physically dependent. 

The problem is, nobody is ever able to maintain a regular usage schedule forever (whether it’s once a month, or once a week, or whatever). Honestly you sound like you’re already psychologically addicted, so it’s just a matter of time until an all day, every day physical addiction follows.

My advice? Quit now while you still can. If you really and truly want to maintain a lifelong recreational opioid habit, you need to limit your usage to 1-2x per year. 

Good luck."

2906,"There is no such thing as using opiods  recreationally. If you're thinking about it, or cant wait till next time, then u're already addicted and eventually u'll fuck it up","Only way you can use them with some semblance of recreation is if you basically use Kratom daily so it’s like a maintenance drug that is safe and relatively less addictive in comparison to methadone or like suboxone, and then you use your drug of choice opiate like once a week, every 2 weeks or once a month. 

And with all the fentanyl on the street these days always either use at a safe injection site or use with a friend that has narcan, and a lot of it, Just in case it’s some really strong shit with a big fentanyl hot spot. I’ve heard of fentanyl overdoses depending on the type of fentanyl and how big the hot spot is taking like 6 or more narcan shots back to back to bring someone out of a big fentanyl OD.  Hopefully your city has safe injection sites though you so you will have someone with proper training there to bring you back and give you oxygen other stuff to make sure you are okay and don’t end up falling out again.

That or maybe just decide to leave this game as a whole behind you... your feature opiate free self with thank you down the line."

2908,How often can you use opiods without gaining a tolerance?,Monthly? Most people will eventually succumb to addiction but it's not like it's impossible to use them every now and again.

2923,How's opium stack up to other opis?,It takes a shit ton of poppies just to get a little gram btw. Need a field of the shit to make it useful.
2924,How's opium stack up to other opis?,"You'd need like an acre of poppies to even begin to make a small amount of morphine/heroin.

Its probably the equivalent of like 1proof/0.5% alcohol.  Sure if you chug like a gallon youll get a minor effect of like half a beer, which someone that never drinks would feel it a little. 

Don't expect to grow 20 poppy plants and get high a bunch of times. Its nowhere near the same as weed where one plant can yield a quarter pound of buds."
2925,When can I fill my script?,"Most States, yes you could. If the pharmacist wants to be an asshole they could make you wait another day or 2"
2926,When can I fill my script?,If you go to a major chain like CVS or Walgreens they will not fill it for two more days. If you go to a small mom and pop pharmacy they may fill or tel you it “Won’t go through”  in which case you can tel them you will pay cash without insurance and usually they will fill.

2950,HELP! how to buy needles?!?,"States are allowed btw. that will make your post easier. And as second thing and as someone who dont lives in the USA, and in a country where you can get syringes without prescription, we alsondont got prescriptions for syringes, I went everytime in the pharmacy and told them I should get some syringes for my grandma who has diabetic but IDK how they are called and asked them friendly if they could show me the ones who are mostly sold for this illness. Every pharmacist was very nice to me and went and got mostly 3 different types and then I said oh thats hers, I recognize them, then they asked how many I want if they werent in a pack of 10 already. Alwqys bought 2 or 3 bags of 10 syringes and needles, they always knew, i think at least, whats up and gave me free alcohol pads too. Only got one time denied when I wanted to buy oral syringes cause I was at the time in the hospital and had a butterfly in my hand which I wanted to use. I then went to my room again and boom there were already a pack of 10 oral syringes with many other Equipment I didnt saw. It was in every room so I took that and went with my spoon and syringe to the bathroom and used the butterfly the nurse put in my hand that morning. It was in there for 3 days and that were the easiest 3 days of shooting dope. Also I switched then to buying them online. You can buy them at Amazon for example. Its nice to get your shooting Equipment delivered to your house. Also bought cookers and wheel filters online. There are also extra sites for all the Equipment we need for shooting dope safely. I cant understand why pharmacist denie new unused syringes to us. Its like they want us to get infections and track marks. I think its more than stupid that you need in some US states a prescription for syringes. I cant understand some of your laws. But also my country got many stupid laws. Like if you go to rehab or detox you get immediatley a note in your law report that you are a drug user and then when your driving and they check your plate that note pops up and they immediatley stop you and are allowed to drug test you without any suspections. Only because you were in a rwhab/detox and got help. Its like they want you to fail at that and then catch you driving under the influence of drugs and taking your driving license for at least 6 month plus you have to drug test every month and do course again which you already did to get your driving license and that course costs about 300-500€ plus 100-1000€ for driving under the influence of drugs. Sooo stupid but hey welcome to fucking Germany. Also they are allowed to test your nearest family (mom, dady bro, sis) only because you wanted help and went to rehab or detox. How stupid is that? But sorry I got off the main thing. If you dont able to buy them in a pharmacy go and check amazon they sell pqcks of 100 pcs. Best of luck."

2953,HELP! how to buy needles?!?,"I'm not like a mod or anything, but I mail cleans if people need them. I currently only have 29g 1/2 inch which is a big needle tho, you probabaly wanna start with 30-31, 5/16 inch.

Let me know if you need help with anything at all, I think the other people have answered how to get rigs pretty well.

I could video call and help you get down a safe injection technique if you need the extra help. There's some stuff I've seen people do seriously wrong that can mess you up.

A couple examples:

(Disclaimer; this is stuff that can happen. Not will. Ive only ever done two things on this list; missing and hitting an artery. I hit an artery because I was being stupid and unsafe, trying to hit super deep veins)

Digging. Do not change the angle of the needle while it is under your skin. Pull it out beforehand. This is called by phlebotomists ""raking the vein"", which I think paints a good picture as to what that does to your veins.

Going at a super steep angle for no reason. Go at as shallow an angle as possible; but still go at an angle that works for you. I personally need the long needles because my veins are shallow. The deeper you go, the more likely you are to hit an artery

Hitting an artery. This one is hard to avoid entirely so you need to be able to recognize the signs. When you register, you'll get very bright blood, not dark like venous blood. It may be frothy, and it may pull in extremely quickly or even push it's way into the needle without you pulling back. Pull out apply pressure. If you do inject into an artery, it will immediately feel like burning and your hand will swell up too big to use for a week or more.

Missing. Missing a shot is bound to happen at some point. It's usually not a huge deal and will go away on its own, unless the redness starts to spread, or it gets bigger more than an hour after the injection. Go to the hospital if this happens as it is infected and will seriously fuck up your arm if you do not.

Not injecting toward the heart. You should always have the needle pointing to your heart. So if you're hitting on your forearm it should be pointed towards your shoulder."

 if your veins are shallow, wouldnt that mean closer to the surface right? if the crook of your arm is facing up like it is when you shoot up. i dont understand why that would require a longer needle, i would think you wouldnt need it to be as long if the veins are right on the surface? can you clarify. and also im a super small guy, does my size/height/weight etc effect the size of my veins? i had a friend go to donate blood and they said his veins were ""too small"" what does this mean? is this possible and if this were to be the case does that mean i just wont ever be able to hit a vein? gonna pm you right now btw regarding you sending clean rigs. thx a ton my man, seriously helps."

2957,HELP! how to buy needles?!?,"Just call around to pharmacies and ask if they sell syringes without a prescription. 

If you are in WA, then pharmacies are allowed to swell them, but each town or pharmacist may have their own rules:


https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.115.050

For instance, there’s a city where I live, which I would expect pharmacies to sell them, but apparently no (at least chain) pharmacy will sell them without a prescription. 

I go just over the line to the same chain pharmacy and was able to guy a pack of 10

Personally I like the 1cc 31 gauge 5/16” needle length. I’ve never need anything longer than that, and whenever I’ve used a longer needle, I’ve been more likely to miss by going completely through the vein — not fun. 

Make sure to use a new one every time! I pretty much do, although here and there I’ll reuse one a second or third time,but when they cost ~$0.35/ea (pack of 10), there’s really no reason to reuse. 

Stay safe."
2958,HELP! how to buy needles?!?,"I’m California, Walgreens tends to be the best. Not sure about up there but try looking online for your specific state"
2959,HELP! how to buy needles?!?,"A lot of this you could have learned via Google. I use 29-31 gauge (higher gauge = smaller diameter, like with piercings), 1cc and half inch, but sometimes they don't have this available and I use whatever they have as long as the needle length and gauge are good. 

In my area you can buy syringes without a script but its up the pharmacist's discretion. I walk in and up to the pharmacy counter and politely say, ""Hi, I need some insulin syringes... 29g, 1cc half inch, please."" If they decline, I move on. Some just don't get that access to clean needles is in the best interest of everyone in terms of harm reduction. I have the best luck at Walgreens and Walmart.  CVS is hit or miss for me. They can turn you down for any reason but can't ""call the cops"" on you or anything... simply possessing unused syringes in the absence of drugs and paraphernalia is not illegal afaik. Google laws and policies for your specific area for more information. 

Amazon is a great option if you're worried about being turned down. There is also tons of info online about this stuff. Don't be lazy and Google it! Good luck ✌🍻"

2975,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,Just stop it now before it gets worse man just end it any withdrawal will be nothing to what you could be facing down the road. You’ll be restless but trust me don’t continue this. Get through it cold turkey you can do it so easily
2976,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,Quit while u can before u have nothing and your sick
2977,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,"No, just stop. Your first habit takes about a month of daily use."
2978,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,"You will likely have some minor wds. Nothing toncompare if you keep using for another 2 weeks. Your brain can now easily switching back to produce the needed endorphins, dopamin etc. and also cold turkey will be good for ya if you have wd symptoms then you can learn from it also cause being sick sucks and if you dont use you wont get sick. I mean some ppl I met really learned from their wds and said they never want them again others like me dont learn from it, I for sure went in my 5 years of full blown addiction through more than 20 wds most cold turkey or with just benzos and Loperamid. Only a few times with Methadon or other opioids which didnt made me high but I tapered down on them and then just had 2 days of flu like symptoms. I also needed 5 years to learn how to use just enough to stay well and taper down with H. So its a slippery road which mostly ends in dead and I think its better to stop for you now than keep using and having real full blown wds. I wish you the best of luck mate."

2981,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,"As others have said, your tolerance is still fairly low and you haven't been taking them super long so your wds will be pretty light and shouldn't warrant tapering. The main thing is that you stop now and for good. The alternative is a road you dont want to go down. Good luck man! You're doing the right thing :)"
2982,I’ve been taking oxy for more than 2 weeks now. I want to stop. Will I get any withdrawals ?,"Any withdrawal symptoms will be relatively mild and transient. It usually takes several weeks to a month or so of daily use in order to become physically dependent, which is a prerequisite for experiencing withdrawal. But no one can say you won’t be dependent on day 14 of use, but dependent on day 15. It’s a process, not a point in time. 

Regardless, if you cold turkey now, it’ll be like a cold or mild flu like symptoms."

What comforts someone is always gonna be unique to them. As far as if she values you, you just know. Most women become more readable as time goes on, she will show she values you, first and foremost by spending time with you. It’ll be in how she looks at you and the times she uses. Good luck."
2993,Have been seeing a girl also in recovery. First time experience with a girl who's previously been an addict like me; what to expect?,I would never date a chick who does/did dope. There’s not a single chick I’ve met in rehab who hasn’t sucked or fucked for dope at some point. Some will openly talk about the trains dopeboys have ran on them in group. Stay far away IMO.

3007,The most you bought at one time?,"Let me look up the statute of limitations before I answer this question...

Alright, 5 years, so we're good.

I have held numerous keys of dope and driven them from the east coast to the midwest. None of this shit was mine, but I got paid to drive it. I dunno if that is what you were looking for, but that's all you're getting out of me. That shit was 7 years ago and I can safely talk about it, the other shit ain't so old."

Thinking back, I'm not sure I've ever purchased more at once for personal use... I bought LSD by the book as a teen, but was selling it (and it was way less than 2gs anyway). I only buy for personal use in my adult life. 

So that's about 2 large for about 10kMMEs, give or take a bit. I'm totally happy with $0.20 per morphine equivalent milligram, since street price for oxy is about $0.65 per MME ($1/mg, 1mg of oxy=1.5 morphine equivalent milligrams). Oh, and a handful of ecstasy.

But it’s an excellent analgesic, for a variety of reasons. If there’s one opioid you could really call a “do it all” painkiller, this would be right up there. It acts on multiple systems, is more predictable than methadone and with less toxicity to boot."

When you say more predictable than Methadone what do you mean? 
I have FQ toxicity that’s given me neuropathies all over and torn ligaments in my foot. I also have a bad case of prostatitis so I’m hoping this stuff works good because the pain gets me close to ending it all."

But it’s exceptionally effective at treating neuropathic pain (similar efficacy to methadone) something which opioid agonists are generally pretty shit at treating. 

As I alluded to, it exhibits agonist activities at all of the opioid receptors (don’t be tempted to take a bit extra due to the Kappa agonism though), functions as an NMDA receptor antagonist (again similar to methadone or ketamine etc) and also exerts effects on monoamine transporters. 

Ahh yes, fluoroquinolones the bane of tendons everywhere. Out of curiosity, were you being treated with glucocorticoids concomitantly with your course of antibiotics? 

It’s an excellent analgesic and I’d expect very good things from it. It also has far less of an effect on the cardiac QT interval, which is a definite plus and it doesn’t really interact with the CYP system so there’s a greatly reduced chance of interactions with other medications that are metabolised by that route. 

All in all, it’s a good choice."

I don’t understand why doctors push so hard with Cipro and Levaquin when their are alternatives that work just fine without ruining people lives. I never showed and bacteria for my prostatitis and every doctor I saw kept putting me on more fluoroquinolones. 10 weeks in all. The damage to my body from those side effects are incredible. I have a very hard time now with memory, I feel like I now have a learning disability for me to learn something new is almost impossible and the stuff I already know seems to be fading. It’s given me floaters and flashes of lights when I look at things from nowhere. Pain all over body and a feeling of impending doom. I have ligaments torn in my foot and the surgeon said until I recover more from the FQ toxicity he will not do the surgery because he said the toxicity heightens the pain to a level I won’t be able to bare. He put me under just to do some stem cell injections and I came to with blood pressure 220 over 205 and thought I was going to die. The FQ toxicity is a living nightmare and those drugs should be ban or used in the most desperate of cases only."

I have a red mark like yours where I missed a little bit too. I hope I'm not getting my first one too. Lol.
3147,Abscess? Or inflamed miss,"Your just looking for the answer you want to hear, so here you go sir.. your fine, just leave it"
3148,"Your just looking for the answer you want to hear, so here you go sir.. your fine, just leave it","Lol I'm really not, since I've never had a legit abscess before I don't know if I need to go to a doctor or not, I know it can turn into gangrene or loss of limb, even sepsis if untreated.

3151,Is there a way to test for carfentanil specifically?,"Aside from a lab, nope."
3152,"Aside from a lab, nope.",damn
3153,damn,If you are willing to wait forever you could send it to Energy Control and have them test it I guess.
3154,Is there a way to test for carfentanil specifically?,Not outside of a lab.  The hospital I ended up in the many times I OD’d on Carfentanil actually had to send the tests out specially to prove that I was OD’ing on Carfentanil and not just regular Fentanyl (because what sort of pussy would I be if I just OD’d on regular Fentanyl ;)
3155,Is there a way to test for carfentanil specifically?,Carfent is one of the fentanyls that the strips from dancesafe test for.

A lot of gas stations and smokeshops also sell it but it's pricier, although the one ive gone to has decent kratom. Id be happy to answer any more questions if there's something specific.

Depending on how you wish to consume it, I would start by taking around a half tablespoon to a full tbsp every half hour to an hour until you start feeling some relief. I think i saw that you mentioned imodium in another comment and that stuff has worked quite great for me, especially fighting suboxone withdrawal. It's hard for some people to recommend because of the risks, but I've only ever used it a few days in a row as sort of a gap to get me through until i got something else.

Will it completely take away wd's? No

My best advice to you is to wait until you absolutely can't stand the wd's anymore. The longer you wait to take kratom, the more relief it will give you. Kratom affects everyone in a different way but MY dosage for dealing with wd's, whether it be dope or sub wd, is about 4-5 grams of a red strain. I've dosed kratom 4 to5 times a day during the worst parts of wd. For me it helps alleviate the RLS as well as the mental angst we get from wding.

That doesn’t sound weird what sounds weird and just a little unexpected to me is that it seems like you can just start taking methadone immediately during a heroin habit and avoid withdrawal completely. That seems odd to me because I have always been used to having to go through a withdrawal period when getting on suboxone. Because I’ve always used suboxone I am always nervous about having to wait the required amount of time to induct the buprenorphine after having a heroin relapse.

In my experience, it is also much cheaper than Bupe and gets you higher than Bupe so I’m more of a Methadone man.

In the US, though, I think they start people at 30mg of Done and edge it up until you’re comfortable.  If you have a serious habit, it’ll take a bit to get you fully comfortable.  When I was doing 3gs a day for example, my Done dosage was 220mg I want to say.",Are you not in the US?
3215,Are you not in the US?,"The point is to keep people on Methadone for as long as possible so they keep making money.  Methadone is turbo strong and it has an ultra long half life so if you end up addicted and get WDs, it sucks a dick.  I kicked Methadone, 220-250mg a day, in County and that was one of the worst experiences of my life.

I am in the US, but I’ve been around.  In a lot of Heroin producing nations, Thailand for example, they do a 3-5 day detox with Methadone.  They give you an equivalent dose to whatever Heroin you were doing, stabilize you on it for 3-5 days, then stop the Done.  You still get cravings, sometimes PAWS too, but the brutal acute phase doesn’t happen.

Last time I was shooting I was shooting about 1.5gs a day of raw Heroin.  My withdrawals were so bad that when I kicked cold turkey, I used to have to ride it out in a bathtub as I’d pour sweat, shit, and puke.  When I came off the last time, I took 120mg for the first 3 days, 80mg for the 2 days following, and then jumped.  I still had a bit of insomnia, I was only sleeping like 4 hours a night, but I was sleeping and I had no acute WD.

If you look up Methadone rapid detox, you should be able to find info online."
3216,Are you not in the US?,"Hope that helps...

You can do kind of the same thing with Bupe, but with Bupe you can end up in PWDs which, having been through that at least 5 times (a few times admittedly intentionally), I would recommend just about anything else.  I ended up staring at myself in the mirror laughing and crying at the same time with a gun to my head it was so painful once (and the depression is gnarly).

As a final note, though, I would not recommend mixing Heroin with Done.  I’ve done it tons of times, but it’s a mega quick way to kill yourself (and Done binds so tight it’s hard to reverse).  I’m not 100% on this, but I believe that’s the cocktail that killed River Phoenix."

And I would definitely use heroin on top of methadone if it’s going to help me get through the first few days until they get me to an appropriate dose. I mean I just want to get on medication assisted treatment in the easiest way possible. I’ve been on and off suboxone for years and I’m terrified of inducting suboxone every time I relapse.

And yes exactly dude it can be so hard to induct properly with all the debt dope now.

3223,What is starting methadone like? How are the WD's compared to starting subs? I've thought about doing a bernese method taper to start subs but I'm also considering methadone.,"Methadone is a full agonist opioid (just like heroin), so taking the right sized dose would have equal analgesic effects as your daily heroin habit. It’s half-life is much longer than heroin, however, so you only have to dose once per day to avoid withdrawal. The first problem with methadone is that most clinics only start you at 30mg, and this may not be enough to completely mitigate the withdrawal symptoms from a large heroin habit (64 bags a day is quite a lot- I would imagine you could handle 200-250mg methadone easily). So you may have to endure some withdrawal symptoms for a few days until the clinic staff can get your dosage right. The other problem with methadone is the clinic itself- you’re going to have to stand in line with a bunch of scumbags at 5 or 6am every single morning to get your dose. After you’re in the program for 6-12 months and turn in clean UA’s over that time frame, they will start to give you “take home” doses so you only have to come to the clinic once a week. 

The other option is Suboxone, but the induction period is much more painful... but on the plus side, Suboxone clinics will typically give you an actual 30 day prescription once they get your dose figured out. Which means a clinic visit only once per month.

Personally, I like methadone.... mainly because I’m a fucking junkie and I like to get high. Suboxone is not going to get you high, but methadone will. Good luck."

3281,Why have i been prescribed naloxone aswel?,"They probably think the naloxone will throw the Bup off your receptors so the Morphine will work. Naloxone won't throw the Bup off your receptors though, I've been given naloxone directly in the vein while on Bup and it had absolutely no effect.

I had same issue needing pain relief while Bup on my receptors. Ended up having to take about 20mg of Subutex to get any kind of relief. 30mg would've prob eliminated pain entirely for me. You'd be better off just upping your dose of Bup. Take 2 to 3 times the dose you normally take and you should be feeling better.

Also, when I had surgery on my femur they gave me IV ibuprofen and it actually worked quite well. There was some issue with my insurance or cost so they had to use opiods, otherwise the IV ibuprofen would've worked totally fine."

It just makes you feel good, no more, no less. It's really a benign drug, to start with. Only when one becomes a junky does it become an absolute necessity.

EDIT: I would definitely smoke, instead of eat, actually, as you don't know how good the opium is, and it is a lot easier to pace yourself when smoking. Less risk of OD."

Thinfoil is my last resort, it ain't a pretty picutre. Its the vibe it gives off; yeah I want to get high but I ain't gotta look like thats all I'm here for. Opium dens had beautiful rugs layed out, drawings and painting on the wall. People spend money on bongs and pipes when you could simply use a 3 gallon bottle and bucket to get a good hit. I'm not into H but when I think about H, I think about the pulp fiction scene when vicent gets high; his little leather bag where everything is sortet properly and clean, its gives the impression of self control and respect, that is still left, a ""healthy"" hiearchy of priorities that tells you ""I can afford what I am doing"".

You said also that you just got one g so I think you want to archieve the best high from it. So the best high is if you smoke it. You also can dose it then perfect. Also you can smoke it in you glasspipe but there will be lwftover which are black and wont really go away also the taste of opium will stay in the pipe everytime you hit it. You can smoke it in there and then get a new one. The glasspipes are just a few bucks. So if you give so much on how it looks then smoke it in the pipe and get a new one for DMT. I know I payed for mine 5€ and it was for smoking meth and crack. And I often tasted the meth when I smoked my crack I rather should have gotten two seperate pipes. Also if you smoke it in the pipe think about that you dont burn too much. Turn your lighter on minimum and dont hold it to near on the pipe. Its easy as this. Also you can clean the pipe again after smoking the g and smoke the leftover residue like people smoke their tinfoil tooter. For opium tea you need more. And also as others said you dont know how strong it is so smoking it is the best idea since it takes some time untill the tea kicks in and if its super strong you can OD. So if I were you I would now choose between tinfoil or your glasspipe. But it runs better on the foil and you can better chase the dragon. IDK how high your tolerance is or if you even got one but your best high will be if you smoke the opium and also the best bet is the tinfoil. Can I ask why its so important to you how it looks? Do you just do it to look cool or do you do it to get a high? Thats the question you have to answer for yourself. Also will you be alone or with others? Cause if you are alone then it dont matters how it looks. I never had a purse like in pulp fiction. But I always managed my life good. Had a good job etc. currently I am because of illness not able to work but still I manage my daily life pretty good. Clean house etc. often the guys who got all their ahit in one bag cant handle their life. They manage to hold their job but more worse than good, their house/Apartment is dirty, their clothes often got holes from nodding out while smoking, their car is fucked up etc. they look like full blown junkies. I just had one binge for 3 month where I really looked like a junkie, pale white, dirty hands, car, house, etc. but its your decision which you have to choose. I wish you anyways happy nods and that you can enjoy the opium. It got a really bitter taste much more bitter than heroin or like smoking some pills which I also never understood why people do that, its just a waste. I think you dont swim in money otherwise you would have more than one gramm of opium. Anyways I dont mean all that in a judging way. I just want that you think about it again maybe.

I don't know anybody who'd be up for that experience, maybe I do but I'm to shy to ask. 

Another guy also talked about ""chasing"", now you put it in the context of ""chasing the dragon"". I'm not very familiar with the term chasing other than following or trying to catch up with someone or something. It'd be great if you could explain it.

I care for what It looks like because it stays with you. I enjoy taking walks at night and one time I went through this pitch dark alley. I was embracing the silence and the darkness, minding my own business when I suddenly stumble upon something, as I wasn't sure what it was, I took out my phone for the light and there I see someone (someone I knew) crouched in the corner smoking meth off of a thin foil. It was awkward especially cause we ""knew"" each other, not like everyone already knew he was a meth-head but he still had his reasons to go halfway through the darkness, so he could enjoy himself. I don't despise these people but I don't want to relate them either. It's like drinking in the park, people take their six-packs and liquors and have a party. Unless you are underaged and have no option, go to a bar; it might cost more but it doesn't hurt to drink a few less beer but do it in a civil manner. It's a dirty picture, that you'll keep with you. As I mentioned if you have a carafe and a bottle of orange juice, you'd definitely be pouring it into when having breakfast. You put your tuna onto a plate and don't spoon out of the can. It shows a lack of self-respect and a distorted value in aesthetical and moral terms. It reflects desperation, uncontrollability and it kills some of the high. 
I mean, take acid, coming back home on acid to a dirty room just kills you. Maybe it doesn't kill you but there is a 100% noticeable difference, the whole experience is based on your environment. This accounts for all drugs, some are more subtlely influenced than others by it. Same for coke, when I'm home I go to the bathroom every 45-60min when I'm out in comfort (not that I ain't comfortable at home), same stuff, 60-90min.
The main reason is the underlying notion and vibe a clean environment gives off, it lets you enjoy the drug a lot more.

The pulp scene, it's not whether or not someone actually has it under control, it's about the impression it gives off. The reason I have one gram is that I just want to experience it and not be doing it again and the day after and so on, once is enough for now. I could have bought 10g and even saved money, it just doesn't seem smart if you don't know what you are up to and your past opioid experience hasn't met your expectations. I really hope this one is different. 

Anyway, I really want to know what you guys mean by chasing."

Anyway, I really want to know what you guys mean by chasing.","Chasing the dragon is related to smoking heroin on the thin foil. While your lighter is under the foil you move the foil and lighter a bit like trails or circles or whatever and the Heroin on the upper side is changing to a reddish color amd is running on the foil and the smoke is going up in the air and you have to chase the reddish H and chase the dragon means catching and inhaling the smoke. So I see there no problems but thats up to your choice. If you feel better if you dont chase the dragon on foil then thats fine for me. Then I would really suggest that you use youe glasspipe, I think thats more aesthetical for you. Then you have to use your lighter on minimum and dont hold it to near on the pipe, you need to experience a bit first also remember to turn the pipe slowly to the right and left side the whole time while you smoke. And if the pipe is to black afterwards go to a headshop and buy a new one if you often use the pipe for DMT, meth, crack or whatever. Also the Heroin or opium, they both turn the same way when smoked are reddish amd like syrup so go slow and easy. Also reddish is the best color because that means its not cut much. If your shit burn super fast and or is darker and darker then the quality isnt the best, at least at heroin but the one time I got free opium (5 tester with .2 in each bag marked with strength and purity) it was also that the bag with 90%  was  reddish very clear and light and the bag with 40% was a mix of a very dark reddish and a bit of black22 color. And didnt run as smoothly as all the others on the foil. I guess you ordered it online.  So if you ordered ""Bayer"" opium which I see often online. The tester were Bayer opium too  and it was good. Ao I would suggest that you use your glasspipe and do it like I described it for you and remember if it gets heated it should get to a reddish syrupy like. Then you do everything right plus turning your pipe right and left and the most important thing is I think you guess it? Yees inhaling. But its very bitter and vinegary like. So have fun and be safe and happy nods and like I always say, you can take more anytime but never less so start low and then if ita not enough for a good high then put some in your pipe again and do it again. I will also take a fast look if I can find a video of how to chase the dragon so you know it.

Yeah I cant even imagine laying there and smoking, I hate it to smoke a cig while laying on the ground like when I go to a park in summer with friends or bathing seas etc. hated it when we layed there and smoked weed when we were about 15-16 years old at night at the bathing sea. Camping there. So uncomfortable. Thank god that I didnt took opis back then when we often camped. I dont know where I should rail my lines. Cause nobody knew I was using back then. Only chilled two times while actively using at the bathing sea and everytime I drove there so I went two or three times alone to my car and used there or in a changing booth. But it was always risky as fuck. Now a days I sadly lost contact to my old gang cause of using but we are currently startes texting again and making plans for a meeting to clearify everything and maybe it will work out and I can hang out with my old friendos (best friends, group of 4 with me, knew each other since school) that would be great. They stayed with me while detox/rehab and the months I was sober after rehab but I stopped contact everytime I relapsed cause I was using at every relapse soo badly and looked like I gonna die in a few min, pale white, got thinner and thinner, black eyes etc. and then I was full of shame and stopped contacting them.

Thinfoil is my last resort, it ain't a pretty picutre. Its the vibe it gives off; yeah I want to get high but I ain't gotta look like thats all I'm here for. Opium dens had beautiful rugs layed out, drawings and painting on the wall. People spend money on bongs and pipes when you could simply use a 3 gallon bottle and bucket to get a good hit. I'm not into H but when I think about H, I think about the pulp fiction scene when vicent gets high; his little leather bag where everything is sortet properly and clean, its gives the impression of self control and respect, that is still left, a ""healthy"" hiearchy of priorities that tells you ""I can afford what I am doing"".

EDIT: the oxy I had wasn't really oxy, it was oxycodone but it came with nalaxon.","Lol dude you're on a forum with a bunch of addicts... ain't nothing pretty about it. Opium dens has nice rugs and shit because of Chinese aesthetic, not opium aesthetic. Opium really is a drug that took everything from a lot of people and in reality was used as a weapon to enslave a group of people."

Crush half and parachute it (put the powder in a gel cap if you have some or some kind of paper and swallow)

As far as I know all Tilidin Generica contain naloxon, so snorting is not an option.

Don't expect to much for some there euphoric others find them sedating



Happy Nods my dude"
3320,Do you know tilidin?,"So since you got no tolerance I would start with max 100mg, which will give you a decent buzz, Tilidin was also my first opi. I guess they are 200/16mg Tilidin/Naloxon Extended release (Retardpillen) So if you are from Germany you got for 99,9% ER pills cause the IR (immediat release pills) are only prescribed with a BTM script and then the doctor often prescribe rather Tapentadol or 10-30mg morphine and sometimes but not often 5mg Oxy with naloxon mostly. So Tilidin is also prescribed in Bwlgium, Switzerland, parts of Africa (mostly OTC there) and some parts of south America. Anyways Tilidin is a prodrug that meams it gets metabolised to nortilidin in the liver so snorting them is a waste. They should have a breaking line in the middle of the pill. So break it in the middle them you got 100mg. 100mg are safe if you got no tolerancw and also you shouldnt get nauseas or not that much from 100mg. You can also break the half pill again to ca. 50mg but 100mg are in my opinion safe and you will also get a decent buzz. Take the 100mg amd after 5-20 min you should feel them. Sadly it could be that you have to puke from the 100mg but I dont think so. If you dont get any decent buzz from the 100mg after ca. 1-2 hours. I would at least takw another 50mg or the other 100mg. The first time I took them, they were my first opi, I took 200mg and got super nauseas, then the second time just 100mg and I was super relaxed. And after about 3-6 hours you can take the other 100mg to be super relaxed again. If you got any questions etc. answer me here or PM/DM me. Have fun. Be safe and keep in mind as much fun and satisfaction, relaxion, euphoria (Tilidin just got a super small euphoria) etc. opiates got, they are a slippery road. I am now addicted since 5 years and pretty good fucked my life up. I nearly died of them now 6 times. Also you got a good chance that you will lose Friends and Family because of them. You will lose much of time. You will lose friends to them. So much more. So make sure to just take the 3 pills and then never look back my friend. As said for more questions or concerns you can PM/DM me. But now have fun :)"

3343,"So, no other way besides rectal administration?",You can snort them but the intranasal bioavailability is just slightly higher than oral because Morphine sulfate (the salt commonly used in Morphine pills) isn't absorbed very well intranasally.

While the water is boiling you drop the powder into the water. Before doing any of that have a rig with the point through a filter. Start drawing up as soon as the powder hits the water. You will draw up the drug and not the binder. We used to do this with the first few OCs that had binders in em. I know for sure we used this technique for MS too.

3351,How long do i have to wait to redose codeine?,"Not sure on the grape fruit part but for your redose question I might be able to help you. It generally depends on the amount that you took.

When I was taking tylonol with codeine (30mg codeine) I would dose every 2 hours, however I was using it for pain and to keep my Hydrocodone wd's at rest. But... to answer your question, if you take a large dose of codeine and are high, I would wait for the high to were off and take another dose 6 hours after to ensure it's out of your system.

3391,i think most opiate addicts avoid drugs like acid like the plague. most of us have crippling anxiety and can barely handle weed. i know many junkies and acid is always a no no for them. i'm the same way. the last thing i want it a drug that induces heavy thinking. with all that being said this is probably something very unique. i've never heard of anything like it. but suboxone is a very strange drug and so is acid. so honestly it doesn't surprise me that you're having some weird ass effects. but yea do some heavy research maybe. doubt you'll find a medical study on this though haha.,"Ugggh I so feel that.

But I also haven’t taken my anxiety meds in days “Lamotrogine” soooo idk if it’s the acid/subs or if I’m withdrawing just from not taking my meds. It’s one or the other. Lol.

It was like a 1/2 g of mushrooms, not enough to do anything, but just enough to make me have a weird feeling. I can’t comprehend how it’d calm anxiety, maybe I just had a bad reaction to it. But I did well on seroquel, not for anxiety mind you, but for the suspicion of being bipolar type 2. Which in retrospect wasn’t  a correct diagnosis.  then I stopped taking seroquel cold turkey and hallucinated that the fabric of reality had transported me to another dimension for a couple days, I felt like this entire world was an imposter and I was the only one who could remember the original. It was a good experience, now I can relate to the man on the corner mumbling to himself."

3397,How fast does your tolerance build?,what are you using? percs? if so about a week or 2
3398,How fast does your tolerance build?,tolerance will build very quickly. imo if you use 3 days in a row you've already got a decent tolerance. for instance you can work from a 15 to a 30 of oxycodone within 3-4 days easily. maybe even sooner than that tbh. tolerance is a bitch and it seemingly happens over night.

One thing for sure it'll do is allow you to take lower doses to achieve same analgesia affect as a higher dose, such as 15mg+grapefruitjuice could feel like 20mg. That could help extend your supply.

I tried researching but didn't find much info about duration since most people use grapefruitjuice to make the high stronger not extend the duration!

3417,very interesting. any idea why this works?,"I believe it has something to do with the way the liver processes medications, something like grapefruit juice interacts with the liver/pharmaceuticals making the liver take longer to process it and thus potentiating it. Not sure if this explanation is exactly on point as I can't remember exactly how it works, but I'm trying to find some research on it to link here. I'll update if I can find anything to explain the science of it more in depth. (:

Edit: So it's not liver that grapefruit interacts with, but rather intestinal enzymes increasing the bioavailability of some pharmaceuticals (especially opiates) and thus potentiating the effects. 

Here's some links explaining the science behind it:

I've never understood it either like why look like you're up to no good you're basically asking for problems at that point. So much easier to blend in with the crowd.

3485,I mean dope is a little more than a plant lol but yeah I get what u mean,"Well Heroin metabolizes into morphine in the liver, so you could say Heroin is actually ""less than"" the plant itself;  as P. Somniferum has other centrally active molecules as well as morphine (which makes kicking the tea so horrible).  It is more the route of administration with Heroin.

I wonder, if Heroin wasn't injected, say it was drank - would it be seen as such a bad drug?  I think one reason alcohol is accepted more, is because it is drank  and everyone drinks fluids.  Whereas H has to be administered via IV  and that frightens people."

I got pulled over literally just for coming out of a gas station once. They didn't even try to give me a reason, I guess they just thought me and my bf looked like addicts. I had literally just stopped there to get cigs and I was about to be so fkn devastated bc I was sick AF and about to go pick up too but I had stopped at the fucking gas station on the way there so I could get my stupid cigs and I had a warrant so I just knew I was gonna get popped. Luckily though they let me go without taking me to jail bc they asked my bf to give them a dealers number and they would do he just gave him the number of someone we used to go thru who was already in prison for dealing, that way he wasn't really snitching, and they let us go thank God. I've always been so pissed about that bc they had no legitimate reason to pull us over other than thinking we were addicts I guess, like we weren't even really in the predominantly black part of town yet, it was a very mixed area, so there was no reason to think we were addicts for that reason either, and we weren't far from our house either.

As long as you aren’t drawing any unnecessary attention to yourself or looking suspicious like constantly looking over your shoulder or you’ve been loitering for a long time just looking sketchy you’ll be OK inside of some place even if a cop does come in.

So I waited a couple more minutes but it just felt too hot to be sitting there when those people had driven by so I just left and drove up the street he wanted to meet on then drove back down it and when I passed by the lil side street I had been on there was a cop parked right where I had been so thank God I listened to my gut and left instead of staying bc of my lil junkie brain telling me not to leave bc he would probably be there soon.

3547,150mg Morphine ER Pills - Did I OD?,No what you experienced may be an allergy to morphine. For some reason straight up morphine effects people in really strange ways.

3550,150mg Morphine ER Pills - Did I OD?,I’m just shocked any ER gives any opiates short of having a severed limb.

I tried the ER even before they passed and they did try to break them up but still they have me nothing and told me to pass them,"My condition is chronic, been seeing a urologist for 5 years now. In the past the stones started small and were managable with ibuprofen and paracetamol. As the stones got bigger and more jagged they upped me to codeine and after that tramadol. After tramadol stopped helping with some of the nastier stones they gave me a one off prescription for oral morphine for extreme cases back in august. I held off on taking any until saturday because I know how addictive it is. I was just so desperate though that I caved.

I can't really describe the pain to it's full extent, I'd say it was kinda like I had a fish hook on the end of a strand of barbed wire attached to my kidney, and someone was trying to pull it out through my urethra.

I'm hoping the docs can find out what is causing these stones to form one day. I'd do anything to prevent them coming back. I've got a big one lodged that won't pass and the theory is that minerals are sticking to that one then breaking off due to the combo of diet and meds I am on. I'm on a waiting list for surgery but the waiting times are insane here in the UK. Hopefully I'll have it done early or mid next year according to my urologist."

3593,"2nd time H experience, or turn back instead?","I’m kind of in a similar boat to you dude. I’ve been using kratom daily for around 3 years but some time ago it lost most of its effects on me but every now and again I’ll get a good burn and when you’re suffering from severe mental illness as I am it’s worth the money in my head to keep buying kratom for that once every 25 burns I actually feel it. I just copped (knowingly) fent for the second time minutes ago and sniffed some: the relief from the never Fkn ending anxiety I deal with daily is gone and my nerves are calm for once. As far as opiates go my history is here and there Percocet and other pill abuse when I can get my hands on it which is pretty infrequent or when I have the money. I’m 29 and don’t remember the last time I felt okay sober so I’m getting to a point where I rly don’t give a fuck anymore and making my mind up if I just wanna say fuck it all and fall onto hard drug use because nothing I’ve tried has provided relief; therapy, every medication there is, herbs and supplements, even Fkn ketamine infusions that finished a week ago for a Fkn whopping 3K ( that my sister helped me pay for). Nothing has helped. The ket infusions were a total failure. Soooo anyways, I’m kind of at a cross roads with nothing rly left for me to try to improve my quality of life at this point and I’m leaning towards saying IM DONE and giving up, living a high life as long as I can support the habit then maybe calling it a fucking wrap.

3594,"I’m kind of in a similar boat to you dude. I’ve been using kratom daily for around 3 years but some time ago it lost most of its effects on me but every now and again I’ll get a good burn and when you’re suffering from severe mental illness as I am it’s worth the money in my head to keep buying kratom for that once every 25 burns I actually feel it. I just copped (knowingly) fent for the second time minutes ago and sniffed some: the relief from the never Fkn ending anxiety I deal with daily is gone and my nerves are calm for once. As far as opiates go my history is here and there Percocet and other pill abuse when I can get my hands on it which is pretty infrequent or when I have the money. I’m 29 and don’t remember the last time I felt okay sober so I’m getting to a point where I rly don’t give a fuck anymore and making my mind up if I just wanna say fuck it all and fall onto hard drug use because nothing I’ve tried has provided relief; therapy, every medication there is, herbs and supplements, even Fkn ketamine infusions that finished a week ago for a Fkn whopping 3K ( that my sister helped me pay for). Nothing has helped. The ket infusions were a total failure. Soooo anyways, I’m kind of at a cross roads with nothing rly left for me to try to improve my quality of life at this point and I’m leaning towards saying IM DONE and giving up, living a high life as long as I can support the habit then maybe calling it a fucking wrap.

I felt PAWS from it for a year after only using it 8 months. A year after quitting, I started gettin methadone from my dad or percs from friends or as my latest experience H.

Kratom though, at first it made me the life of the party. By the end.. I was mentally exhausted, strained, uncomfortable, and felt a deeper sadness apart from depression.

I quit, used Ativan to detox bc restlessness (akathisia actually, it's an inner restlessness so limb movements don't help). My best friend was proud of me. He saw first hand how it made me. 6 hours after a dose I had to redose, always kept a lil baggy for kratom and scale and spoon lol

I can't keep using kratom sadly after that, one use I get sorta more restless for a few weeks and if I used a couple weeks later I'd get more restlessness. I hate it.

Edit::: God fuck do I understand you on the anxiety thing. I have an anxiety disorder. It's the worst. Seriously. And then ADD on top of that?? Life is something I can't handle lmao"

24/7 I feel like you described, such horrid inner restlessness I mean I feel literally like my skin is Fkn crawling and it feels disgusting. It could be from my baseline anxiety, it could be side effects I guess of an anti psychic I was on once for anxiety since I know they can cause it.

I have this uncomfortable feeling in my chest that goes upward, sometimes I'll kinda feel it in my back but I bet you can feel it other places

Akathisia can be caused by medication like you said, yes but it can also be caused by a plethora of drug withdrawals. Kratom, opiates, benzos especially I hear, alcohol(my personal experience... I'm restless now bc I relapsed on alcohol 5 days ago.. Fuck me right? Why do I do this to myself lmao but jokes aside I know why), uhhh I'm sure other stuff too but I just listed examples.

I'm not sure about the ""anxiety causing akathisia"" thing, but I have seen plenty of people even mistake akathisia for anxiety. For me, I don't view akathisia and anxiety as intersecting but it could be for somebody else yknow.

Also the internally writhing part I really relate to. It can drive people to suicide apparently, but I don't know much about that. I can DEFINITELY see why tho.. lol"

im sad i missed the glory days when the va woulda allegedly hand out opis and benzos like candy","yep same bro, i heard back in the late 90s early 2000s it was a free for all with the pills...locked up now but overall probably for the best."
3661,"yep same bro, i heard back in the late 90s early 2000s it was a free for all with the pills...locked up now but overall probably for the best.",yeah it sounds like it was kinda like that everywhere but on a different level with the VA. someone on here was saying theyll give you subs if you tell them youre an addict. ive been thinking about that but im not sure
3662,How many of y’all are veterans?,"My husband is a Navy Gulf War Vet. He was in for 9 years. He has ptsd and other issues from things that happened while active duty. He turned to alcohol and stealing my pain meds when he got out (I'm a chronic oain patient and on fentanyl and morphine). He is now struggling with recovery and only gets tramadol from the VA for his knee, which he goes through way too early."

I came out of the military with prescriptions and because I moved to a new state and switched to VA healthcare I had to go cold turkey until I could see a psych in my new state, the appt. to see the psych had a waiting list about 2 months long. You would think for someone getting discharged with mental issues and active prescriptions they would try to accommodate that a bit better but hey, like I said it is what it is. At least if I go to ER for something I don’t have to worry about crazy medical bills!"
3666,How many of y’all are veterans?,Sam Stone John prine
3667,How many of y’all are veterans?,i'm not a vet but i know a few addicted ones. seems like the military is very keen on prescribing kpins to just about everyone. the majority of my friends had minor drug issues before joining. then when they got out and got paid out they went crazy. one dude gets a monthly check for disability and the other is just living off money he's saved. both were in combat and have ptsd. they got home to all their friends addicted to drugs and alcohol too. the one that lives off disability is more broken though. he saw something that really fucked him up. i just wish that you guys could smoke pot and not be force fed benzos.
3668,How many of y’all are veterans?,Thank you and god bless you for your service. I’ve recently saw on the news about veterans protesting outside the VA hospitals by smoking weed and saying it’s better than the cocktail of drugs that’s prescribed to them

3672,never had hydros before - dosage/nausea/tips?,I’d take 20 mg if you’re able to take 15 mg of oxy. Should be a similar high and I don’t expect any nausea if you don’t get nausea from oxy.
3673,never had hydros before - dosage/nausea/tips?,Oxy is 1.5x stronger than hydro but I think the highs are similar enough you could take 20-30mg to start
3674,never had hydros before - dosage/nausea/tips?,"Like the others said take 20-30mg on an empty stomach, and eat a light snack after dosing to combat nausea. If the nausea gets intense some ginger chews or Benadryl work well at stopping it. 

If you don’t take opiates often don’t drive or do anything that could hurt others or yourself while high! The hydro buzz feels great and will probably give you a nice warm energy, but play it safe if you aren’t used to the opiate high."

3676,difference between hangover after a session and withdrawals?,It’s withdrawals bud
3677,It’s withdrawals bud,"ok thanks, probably knew that really, makes a lot of sense, but how come I'm having withdrawals after just a one-off use though? I used to use a lot before but still, i thought you needed to use for a sustained period of time for withdrawals to kick in?"
3678,"ok thanks, probably knew that really, makes a lot of sense, but how come I'm having withdrawals after just a one-off use though? I used to use a lot before but still, i thought you needed to use for a sustained period of time for withdrawals to kick in?",If you have had a habit before your body doesn’t forget that and goes back to the state of full blown addiction much quicker.  It gets harder every time you have a habit and withdraw off it.
3679,"ok thanks, probably knew that really, makes a lot of sense, but how come I'm having withdrawals after just a one-off use though? I used to use a lot before but still, i thought you needed to use for a sustained period of time for withdrawals to kick in?",I mean chances are u felt withdrawals. They weren’t full blown where u could barely get out of bed. What I’m trying to say is symptoms vary depending on usage and length of usage
3680,"ok thanks, probably knew that really, makes a lot of sense, but how come I'm having withdrawals after just a one-off use though? I used to use a lot before but still, i thought you needed to use for a sustained period of time for withdrawals to kick in?",in my personal experience i will feel withdrawal like symptoms after just one use. i relapsed not that long ago and when i woke up the next day i felt like shit till i went to sleep again. woke up the next day fine. albeit slightly depressed. but it was all very manageable. just reminded me why i don't do opiates anymore. specifically BTH though. that shit always happens to me with BTH.
3681,difference between hangover after a session and withdrawals?,it's just very minor withdrawals. which honestly i feel like can happen after just a couple uses.

3689,Wisdom Teeth Removal - where to get meds?,Why would you go the hospital you go to an oral surgeon
3690,Wisdom Teeth Removal - where to get meds?,Can you call your surgeon’s office? I assume they practice out of the hospital but probably also have an office. That’s who would usually treat post op pain. Or call your primary care doctor.
3691,Wisdom Teeth Removal - where to get meds?,Are you in the US? What kind of hospital removes wisdom teeth? Do you mean oral surgeon? If not you need to make an appt with a local dentist or oral surgeon to help.
3692,Are you in the US? What kind of hospital removes wisdom teeth? Do you mean oral surgeon? If not you need to make an appt with a local dentist or oral surgeon to help.,i would say this or your primary care giver at your main doctors office.

3694,Wisdom Teeth Removal - where to get meds?,Yeah what they said^. Any backsdtory bro? Why did you get it done at the hospital? What happend? Did you have an oral surgeon or a dentist before? My oral surgeon Wrote me a script but it wasn’t that many. If you didn’t get them when you got it done I’m not sure if you’ll be able to unless you go to another doctor and maybe explain to them you’re in pain? Not sure to be honest man.
3695,Wisdom Teeth Removal - where to get meds?,"Yes, you have a legitimate need for hydrocodone. I got 30 5mg hydrocodone when I had mine done but that was 15 years ago, I had insurance, and it was done by an oral surgeon.

3700,Wisdom Teeth Removal - where to get meds?,I got a script of percs the yellow ones when I had mine done but that was 15 years ago... these days doctors are so scared that something is going to come back on them that they won’t even prescribe anything but Tylenol... I know you don’t want to get in trouble... but at least help the patients with actual needs... this is the type of bullshit it has come to... sorry your dealing with that. Tooth pain is the worst.
3701,Wisdom Teeth Removal - where to get meds?,If your state can sell low codeine pills at pharmacy’s without prescriptions get some and do a cold water extraction 100mg of Codeine = about 6.5 mg of oxy or 10 mg of hydrocodone or 10mg or morphine
3702,Wisdom Teeth Removal - where to get meds?,I’d hit up a doctor mate.  God.  Australia is quite hard to get pain relief from doctors because everyone got on the oxy train some years ago and did a lot of doctor shopping.:: but you can’t really argue with someone who has a bloody tooth socket and massively swollen jaw following wisdom tooth extraction.  Go to a doctor and be honest with them.
3703,Wisdom Teeth Removal - where to get meds?,your local drug dealer. other options won't be quick enough.
3704,What does shooting heroin feel like?,"Like warm apple pie...

I had my first taste of diacetylmorphine in the back of an ambulance when I was about 11 years old. It was a feeling of almost instant warmth, euphoria, anxiolysis (I cant really comment on whether I thought it was “orgasmic” as I didn’t really know what one was at the time), the pain melted away, I felt lightheaded and with a pleasing sense of paresthesia (pins and needles). 

The best way I could describe the paresthesia, (if you’ll forgive the crude and vulgar analogy) was like when you nut, but she (or he, not judging) keeps sucking.

I was hypersensitive and wanted the feeling to stop, but simultaneously, I wanted it to increase in intensity. Sort of like when your leg goes to sleep and you try walking on it. It tickles and feels funny. 

It’s basically the same as IV morphine, but more intense due to the smack being more lipophilic and therefore having a faster onset of action. 

You could’ve sawn my legs off and I would’ve looked at you and smiled with big puppy dog eyes. 

I can’t speak to the gear you get on the street & most of the “Heroin” being sold, isn’t diamorphine rather fentanyl ore an analogue thereof, but I can certainly see the appeal of the stuff. 

Now that I’m not 11 anymore and my testicles have descended and I know what an orgasm actually is, if I could pick between getting blown by a supermodel of my choice, or an IV shot of pure pharma smack, I’ll be honest, I’m gonna choose the smack. 

But that’s just like, my opinion man. 

It’s *that* good."

It has the same indications as morphine, but is sometimes preferred due to its faster onset.",Probably the hardest one i had was fentanyl... How do they compare? I've always avoided heroin because of watching intervention and the heroin addicts never seem to get their life back 100%.
3714,Probably the hardest one i had was fentanyl... How do they compare? I've always avoided heroin because of watching intervention and the heroin addicts never seem to get their life back 100%.,"Fentanyl is renowned for being somewhat lacklustre in the euphoria department. It’s an excellent analgesic, highly lipophilic with a rapid onset of action, but comparing it to diamorphine is, in my opinion, chalk and cheese.

People tend to think if you try heroin once, you’re instantly hooked for life. That’s patently absurd, it’s certainly alluring and pleasant & many people do become psychologically addicted to it. But there are also a great many people who use it occasionally or are able to appreciate it for what it is and look back with nostalgia and find memories, yet never use it again."

3722,What does shooting heroin feel like?,It is sometimes wonderful other times it’s pure nausea for 8 hours unable to do anything other than lie down somewhere and groan.  It isn’t always wonderful.  But it does always take away whatever problems I couldn’t stop my brai from ruminating on.  It was perfect for my overactive brain.  It was an instant don’t give a fuck injection
3723,What does shooting heroin feel like?,"Feels like ultimate relaxation, like sinking slowly into the most plush cushion you've ever sat in. Anxiety, antidepressive action, and god do I get good sleep when I'm ready. Calm peace and euphoria. However,
I have a preference to Thebaine due to the speedy effects of oxy. Oxy is more like if there was a middle ground where very clean coke could shake hands with a warm opiate.

But...there's two sides to each coin my friend. In general with opiates I've noticed the more elevated and uplifted I feel when I binge due to opiates, (Quality of Manufacture) plays a huge roll too, the more horrible the symptoms of withdrawal are."

Also agree the quality of the manufacturer impacts the pain killing and euphoria.  I’m a big Rhodes fan.  Google the brand name and everyone hates them.  They get me the most impact with the least dose and also have the most side effects (itching, acne, lack of sex drive, constipation, etc) and the withdrawals are so much worse than multiple other brands Going through them right now.  For example I was taking KVK Tech 15’s and I thought I struck gold, wrong.  I had to increase my dosage drastically and it just made me nod.  The withdrawals were almost non-existent.  It makes me almost want to switch back just for the easier WD’s!"

3741,Anyone know if tianeptine cancels out oxy or vise versa?,"Way too late and maybe you found out, but just so people will see this when using the search function, tianeptine will COMPLETELY cancel out other options. One of my biggest regrets was moving to tianeptine. Before, a 40 mg OP oxy would have me high for hours. I remember after a month or two with tia, I took 120 mg OP oxy and DID NOT FEEL A THING. I regret completely trying it.


As far as combining meds, you can't. Kicker has always been the man, I've got the most respect for him, and it might not make sense with these meds based on what research has shown thus far, but please trust me that anecdotally,  you have to go multiple days without tia to start to feel oxy again, at least in any normal sort of dose. My guess is how much tia it takes to have an effect, but whatever it is, I'm hoping others will consider not using it. 

Eventually, nothing touches your tolerance, so you use more tia, and then once your body gets addicted to tia, the withdrawal is a nightmare because of the unique compound. 

When I was using it, the sodium was readily available and moderately cheap. I dont think either are true anymore, so there is zero reason to start on it. To the OP, and anyone considering it, I PROMISE anything, including sobriety, is much better than choosing to use this substance."

3828,Best comfort meds/routine?,"Xanax and loperamide. Hot showers are great- they induce dopaminergic effects and also dilate blood vessels, thereby lowering blood pressure. In a perfect world, I’d sit in a hot tub for the entire withdrawal process with an unlimited supply of Xanax and loperamide. However, the world isn’t perfect and I’ve worked through withdrawals with 0 comfort meds many times. I’ve also found that going out of town and going on a week long alcohol bender works pretty good, too. The key here is to not stop drinking. Start drinking as soon as you wake up, and don’t stop until you pass out. I’ve used this method a few times. On one of those occasions I had a lot of Xanax and Adderall too, though. It was a pretty painless detox. Oh yea, Adderall works great for opiate withdrawal also. Tried gabapentin, and although it did mask some withdrawal symptoms, I didn’t like the way it made me feel. Felt like being drunk with extra brain fog. Believe it or not, OTC pain meds, especially Aleve and Excedrin, help a lot with withdrawal pains and headaches.

About the only thing I haven’t tried is clonidine... it’s a standard med at detox facilities and everyone raves about it, though. Wish it was OTC!"

Also, subs are very strong in how they bind to the receptor. Even a small dose will bind very strongly and the dose-response is not linear at all.

If you don't want to listen, I can't force you to and if you don't then I urge you to at least have someone to look after you if you do this and also to share yout experience on here with others (it will be bad) to prevent others from making the same mistake.

Goodluck","Thanks for the great answer. I'll follow that advice. I hope it wears off and I will be in WD tomorrow. Weird thing to hope for when all I've hoped for, for the last 6 months, was to get high.

3909,I'm thinking maybe right before i go to sleep if im still high? Like a line of 0.5-1mg sub? Wouldnt that bring out the wd and make sure that i am in WD in the morning?

I just want to get this whole thing started really,"If you do take bupe when you are not in WDs it will be the last time you ever do that!  I took an 8mg strip once 12 hrs after my last shot thinking that was long enough... it wasn’t and it was as bad as day three cold turkey off a decent H habit... it’s awful.  Use the COWS scale (google it) and wait til you are in the middle range of WDS.  Also if you can ask to only have 2mg to begin with... that will kick in and either make things worse or a bit better... then a few hours after that have more.  That works for me anyway, taking a big dose to begin with if you aren’t far enough into WDs will be fucked.  2mg isn’t as bad. 

A friend of mine used the logic you are using with an 8mg strip.  He figured using it would kick him into WDs quicker and get the whole thing over with quicker... he shot it up and immediately puked over everything and was that bad that he nearly went to hospital for help (which there isn’t any of!).

As another person said bupe has a higher affinity for our opiate receptor sites... it kicks off the full agonists that are sitting there (which would be whatever opiate you are using) so it’s like very quickly, almost instantly you have all that drug violently ripped away from you, suddenly sober and it is a very very uncomfortable ride.  Being in mild withdrawal is much better.  

They say at least 12 hours after h, fent, oxy... that wasn’t long enough for me but we are all different.  Use that COWS scale and you will be okay.  If you already have some you could be honest at the appointment and just indict yourself later when you are feeling bad enough to start them.  Inbox me if you want about it. ✌️"

One day i said fuck it this isnt a good hole to keep digging and took 4mg sub 4 hours after my last dose.

I would imagine the rationale of PM doctors is that patients taking an opioid agonist (Kratom) that hasn’t been vetted by the FDA is contraindicated for patients who are supposed to be following a strict regimen of prescription pharmaceutical opioids. 

Not saying I agree with it, but I can understand the rationale. Some times you have to think of things from the perspective of the other side instead of the perspective of an addict. Doctors who write opioid scripts are under the microscope right now, and they will not treat patients who they consider liabilities and potentially pose a risk to their livelihoods. And whether justified or not, patients who do not follow clear instructions and take non-prescribed medication (including Kratom) are going to be considered huge liabilities."

The cost of providing clean needles and equipment is a LOT less than the cost of treatment for the effects of infections and other associated problems with using and sharing dirty needles etc. Pretty much every working person, addict or not will be paying national insurance over the course of their life so it's completely fair to provide this stuff free and I wouldn't change it for the world.

my observation is that if i'm sleep deprived because i'm hanging, then i have a shot the following morning while still tired, this shot removes the reason for the insomnia and i'm now ready to sleep

it's ok if i CAN sleep, but there are usually other things that need doing

i find that the size of the shot doesn't affect this situation much, so long as what i have is sufficient to stop the withdrawal, i'll want to catch up on sleep upon having it"
3990,"Do you guys find that the quality/ amount of sleep you’ve gotten has an effect on your dose? For example if sleep deprived, will your normal dose make you more sedated/noddy than it usually does?",If I’m extra tired then I felt it less. After being in wd and therefore not sleeping at all the first line usually just made me feel relieved and maybe high. It wasn’t until I had a full nights sleep that I would feel it as intensely again.

3994,Does alcohol potentiate opiates? (Low doses),"alcohol, like benzos, reduce one's tolerance to opiates

i used to take two xanax before each shot and i got MUCH better value than just having the shot alone

be CAREFUL though, a dose that will get you nice and stoned WITHOUT anything else in your system could well be enough kill you if mixed with benzos or grog"
3995,Does alcohol potentiate opiates? (Low doses),"It potentiates it, in that they are both CNS depressants, so yeah, can make nods more likely. I find the combination pleasant, but it is risky, of course."
3996,Does alcohol potentiate opiates? (Low doses),At low doses - absolutely. I am a pain patient and when I was severely undersized I would mix 5mg hydrocodone with 3 glasses of wine. I’m not saying it’s smart or healthy but I was fine and virtually pain free if only for a couple hours. I’m on a higher dose now and still have 1-2 glasses on special occasions. No issues and liver panel looks great. If you do it at all regularly get liver panels when you have your annual physical to keep tabs on that.
3997,Does alcohol potentiate opiates? (Low doses),imho yes it does.
3998,Does alcohol potentiate opiates? (Low doses),"Yea it can be a good feeling combo and I’ve heard of people that get addicted to both, but the CNS effects make it a gamble with you’re life. Anything with gaba activity feels good with opiates."
3999,Does alcohol potentiate opiates? (Low doses),"In my experience it potentiates it, but takes away from the euphoria. I felt more ""fucked up"", but less euphoric as compared with other potentiators. YMMV"
4000,2 mg or sub will h still work?,"Honestly depends on how much dope you do. Did you take the sub at 5pm? I honestly would just wait to do my dope once I started to feel sick from WDs so I didn't waste it, but theoretically you should be able to break through it with a high enough dose, but me personally I wouldn't want to risk wasting a big shot or falling out from doing too much at once."

I did oxys for a long time and sometimes I wouldn’t be able to feel anything after taking a 2 mg sub for at least 12 hours after I took it. I’d wait until you start to either feel bad again or wait 12 hours minimum.

Suboxone is a sneaky and potent fucker, that shit will mess up your dope high in even small amounts.  Especially if you’re fairly Opiate naive and think you took around 2mg, you’d like be wasting your shot.  Give it like 36hrs at a minimum before shooting anything."

Especially if you’re fairly Opiate naive and think you took around 2mg, you’d like be wasting your shot.  Give it like 36hrs at a minimum before shooting anything.","Exactly. Wasting a shot is devastating but it would definitely be worse to overdose trying to do enough to break through the sub. 2mg is a pretty decent sized dose of bupe for someone who's never done it before, I'm surprised it didn't throw op into precipitated WDs already.

But op even if it did throw you into them you're still gonna wanna wait a while before you try to do another shot. You won't be able to gage it by when you're feeling sick again since the sub already made you feel sick, but if you listen to this dude and wait at least 36hrs you should be good."
4004,2 mg or sub will h still work?,"Like the previous poster mentioned, fentadope will easily break through. Also 2mg is somewhat of a lower dose leaving plenty receptors ready to party"

4006,2 mg or sub will h still work?,I dont think its gonna be fentdope tho just dope. The shit my dude has is alright not the greatest not trash tho either
4007,2 mg or sub will h still work?,I think you’ll feel something.   At least I used to do 2mg before work and could feel a decent shot 8 hrs later.   Maybe stretch it another 2-3 hrs?
4008,I think you’ll feel something.   At least I used to do 2mg before work and could feel a decent shot 8 hrs later.   Maybe stretch it another 2-3 hrs?,"2 mg only covers 12.5-25% of opiate receptors, it should, from a mathematical standpoint, work."
4009,2 mg or sub will h still work?,Maybe a little. Mkre so if you get fentdope.. Then in will break through

4030,What dose are you on? I've read that 8-16 mg cover 98% of opiate receptors.,I'm on 11.4mg (Zubsolv is 5.7mg and I take two of them).

4032,Is it worth the time and money to try to use on top of buprenorphine (Zubsolv)?,Not worth it.  Sounds like your Sub dose might honestly need to get upped.  I'd holler at them white coats and tell them to get their pens a-clickin-and-scribblin.

4034,Sorry quick test ?,15-20mins? Depending on how fast your body metabolizes it?

4036,Sorry quick test ?,72 hours
4037,Sorry quick test ?,1 hour for me
4038,Sorry quick test ?,Within the hour.

4045,I tried this. I just got addicted to tianeptine. Go with kratom.,"I switched from subs to tia back to subs. I just got sick of dosing every three hours. As someone with chronic pain, subs just are a stronger analgesic. That said, tia withdrawls are about as bad as sub or pill withdrawls. Not worse than H, fent, or carfent. The people who claim differently are entitled to their opinions, but that just always blew my mind."

Also in my country its hard to get on mdone or subs if you arent over 30 and am 22. So IDK man. I just dont want to fuck it up again and OD again like the last times.

4058,What do you guys do against extreme urge to use?,"I’m currently 37 days off oxys and 13 days off subs. It’s definitely going to be hard af the first 1-2 weeks. For me, I’ve just thrown myself into work and plans that I didn’t feel like going to just to stay busy. It gives you less time to think. I picked up some Xanax for the first week, they helped a lot. I wouldn’t use them beyond two weeks though. Hot showers before I went (or tried) to sleep helped with this the restlessness and helped regulate my body temperature. Weed would probably be helpful also, I’m just personally not into weed."
4059,What do you guys do against extreme urge to use?,"Exercise (even just a walk with some music), hot showers, do something you enjoy, binging TV works too"
4060,What do you guys do against extreme urge to use?,Music can sometimes help. Playing music is a big help if you know how to play an instrument. No better time like the present to learn an instrument though. Might help you more than you know. Definitely a great way to distract yourself if you like to be good at what you're trying to learn.

Definitely a great way to distract yourself if you like to be good at what you're trying to learn.,I definately second this. You can let your emotions out while playing. It's very therapeutic
4062,What do you guys do against extreme urge to use?,"One trick I learnt off another commenter a while ago was.. when you're feeling that urge to use, tell yourself "" ok fine, I'll use - but I have to wait 1 hour"".. then when that hour arrives you tell you brain ""yes ok I'll let you get high, but only if you wait one hour""... And etc etc.

I tried it and it really does work.. your brain gets happy that soon you'll be high, you begin to busy yourself in the meantime and usually the urge gradually fades. When you feel the urge to use again you repeat the process. It's all mental, your brain will fucking do anything for that drug 😂"
4063,What do you guys do against extreme urge to use?,Try to be around people and talk about it. Recognizing that these cravings is just our decease gasping for air and that it’s not what you REALLY want to do helps me a lot. Though unfortunately there comes a time where I cave in...
4064,Try to be around people and talk about it. Recognizing that these cravings is just our decease gasping for air and that it’s not what you REALLY want to do helps me a lot. Though unfortunately there comes a time where I cave in...,Absolutely true. It's just the devil on your shoulder trying to pull you back into destruction and devastation:( fuck this disease.
4065,What do you guys do against extreme urge to use?,"Stay busy, ideally go to work and don’t bring my stash with me. That guarantees that I’ll be sober 9 hours, then when I get home I’m generally too tired to go score. Puts it off for a day at least. Join a gym, so you can go to the gym and just say that’ll use after you workout. The catch being that you have to run to the gym, so pick one that’s 2 miles away. You’ll feel so good and content after you workout for a couple hours the urge to use fade. Repeat until you don’t feel the urge. The urges don’t last forever either... just until your brain resets in a month or so... and then they will strike occasionally, but each time you say no, is a time that you can say no again."
4066,What are the white spots in BTH?,"Cutting agents, fent possibly? Could be so many things"

I read it before it came out to be fabricated and i remember thinking that I had never read anything as graphically accurate as that book. But yes, it did turn out that he made up or exaggerated a lot of the stories. I honestly believe the dude just took a few different peoples (probably a few of his own)  war stories and combined them and made them fit like it was his own story. Even after it came out, I still have re-read it probably 4-5 times and still love it. I just take it for what it is now and enjoy it for that. And the guy below is correct, it’s by James Frey.

4102,Holy shit that movie was based on a novel?!,"Yes. The novel is fucking amazing. Welsh perfectly captures each character in words. A masterclass on portaits in writing. There are two sequels, which are good but not quite as great, and there is a prequel that I downloaded the same time as JUNK. I think I'll read Burroughs first, as this will be the first novel of his I've read."

It was an awful two months. When I got out, I used for ten days, then quit for good. Three months in, I still felt jusk ok, so I went on subs. Spent the last nearly 20 months on subs, kratom, or tianeptine. Currently on subs, cuz they're the best for pain of all three. I got tboned by a semi on the highway while I was still using, so that pain is still there. So is my anxiety, depression, and ptsd. Basically, I'll always need something for pain and fucked up brain, but I do consider myself clean and have no doubt I would have relapsed and died if not for my helpers. Honestly, should have gone on methadone, but I've read it causes weight gain and this-120#-is as big as I'm ok with being without an eating disorder reappearing. I wish you luck."

ETONITAZENE

It has been suggested that etonitazene is the most addictive substance on the planet. As an opioid, it exhibits 1,500 times the potency of morphine, but it’s also a stimulant on par with ecstasy. Basically, it’s a molecular speedball. Although etonitazene has appeared as a street drug on a few occasions, the vast majority of the world’s supply is consumed by mice and monkeys in addiction studies. Scientists know that rhesus monkeys lick their little furry lips with delight when you spike their water dish with etonitazene, but monkeys like a lot of shit, and as the old saying goes, never send a rhesus monkey to do a man’s job.

Thomas Highsmith worked at a prestigious laboratory in Salt Lake City designing low-friction laminates for high-performance skis. In 2003, he started spending long nights in his lab secretly manufacturing a personal supply of etonitazene. Shortly after completing the synthesis, he became hopelessly addicted. He would show up for work clutching a 12-ounce spray bottle of etonitazene and fiendishly snort it throughout the day. Over the course of a couple of months, his tolerance escalated to the point where he was taking 300 times his starting dose. A coworker became suspicious of Highsmith’s odd behavior and reported him to the police. His etonitazene supply was seized, and he was prescribed methadone to combat the withdrawal. At that point, his addiction equated to 500 bags of heroin a day, and the methadone umbrella did nothing to deflect the 10,000-pound etonitazene anvil hurtling toward his head. Highsmith never received a criminal sentence because he was found dead in his home before his first court date. The withdrawals were so severe that he had killed himself to escape the pain."

Two years ago, a young Canadian guy made a post on an internet drug forum begging for help withdrawing from an unknown opioid he called pharaohfentanyl, a synthesis of a new fentanyl derivative that he claimed to be 4,000 times more potent than morphine—the strongest opioid a human had ever tasted. He was generally mocked and assumed to be a liar, but after asking around a bit, I’ve come to the conclusion that his story was probably true. Although his original intention had been to deal the drug on blotter paper, he started using and spent the next six months on a nonstop pharaohfentanyl binge. His dosage increased 675-fold, and by the end he was using amounts that would equate to 3,300 bags of heroin a day. His breath alone was strong enough to make someone nod. He destroyed his entire supply and quit cold turkey. Here is how he described the withdrawal: “I cannot feel my FACE! It’s like touching a brick wall. It feels like I took a bath in MENTHOL, my insides feel like ice… that will shift after a few seconds to MENOPAUSE-ESQUE INSANE hot flash like a wave of lava under my skin with profuse sweating… I’M SOOO WEAK AND SOOO TIRED AND SOOO DRAINED I JUST WANT IT TO GO AWAY RIGHT NOW!”

4152,Has anyone quit fentanyl?,Back in 2016 I got clean off fent in a detox. It was horrible. I'm pretty sure it was an analogue because on day 3 I took a sub and went into precipitated withdrawal. I spent 21 days there and still didn't feel great. Spent 5 months in a halfway house and the sweats were still coming hard from my pits after 6 months clean. Went on methadone not long after getting home and coming off 100mg cold turkey in a jail cell was easier than that bullshit. Stay strong my dude.

so lets say you use a gram of dope per day. day 1 you will take 0.125mg bupe then 0.8g dope. day 2, 0.25mg bupe then 0.6g dope. day 3, 0.5mg bupe then 0.4g dope. day 4, 0.75mg bupe then 0.2g dope. day 5, 1mg bupe. 

then on day 5 when you drop the dope and take 1mg bupe, you can increase your bupe amount and induce more if needed. id reccommend inducing another 1mg per hour or so until youre relatively comfortable, and i personally wouldnt exceed 8mg bupe. 

to answer your questions: it doesnt hurt, but its slightly less comfy than youre used to. you wont be getting high anymore, youll be feeling not sick  and around baseline normalcy-ish. the WD shouldnt be significant really if you do it right. and you should be able to work during the transition yes."

They’re not very exact but it’s doable I’ve done it. Anything smaller and you probably need a razor or start getting very uneven and it gets way harder. It’s just splitting a strip into eighths and then splitting one of those eighths into four pieces. I have a few cut up that small at home
4170,Has anyone ever had success with the Bernese method? And my dealer shorted me a few bags on my last purchase how do I bring it up with him?,"I microdosed subs while rocking a decent oxy habit and it worked fine. Never taken both at the same time though. I just did a little bit (about .25-.5mg and waited it out about an hour). I think the idea is that once the subs uis adequately in your system, you can tolerate higher doses of subs so stick with the .25 or even more if you aren't getting sick from it. Keep upping the subs even if you aren't lowering your heroin dose. Eventually you'll realize that the H isn't getting you as high and you can start lowering it.

I really want to do this but I'm terrified of the withdrawals required to induct suboxone. Can you tell me more about your experience doing this, like how much heroin you were doing when you transitioned to subs this way and how bad the withdrawals were for the duration of it. Did you feel the worst when you got above one mg? Did the dope help after taking one mg or could you barely really feel it at all after getting above one mg? Do you think I could chat with you some way, I'm really anxious about this and I want to get more information and determine what the best way to go about this is. I have a limited amount of dope left and everyday it gets smaller and I get more anxious about this transition. Especially bc I think my dope is cut with some fent analogue that makes it so that I have to wait a crazy 2 days (maybe I could do it with one day but I'm not sure I've never been able to wait longer than I think 16 hours) probably to get sick enough on the cows scale to induct suboxone properly. Other times I've done this I end up taking it at twelve hours and precipitating withdrawal, not terribly bad but bad enough that it feels pretty awful and I can't sleep and writhe around for another twelve hours or so and feel withdrawals for a while maybe a day after."

You can try boofing your dope but just be aware it has a much higher bioavailability

4187,Anybody know the bioavailability of Percocet with an IN ROA?,Snorting acetaminophen is a bad idea... 🤦🏻‍♀️ Take it orally it if it has acetaminophen next time. ✌🏼
4188,Anybody know the bioavailability of Percocet with an IN ROA?,If your tolerance is low you will feel it slightly. Otherwise should have just popped both. I like to snort with or without tylenol so youll be ok maybe have some nasal congestion. I think actual BA is low intranasaly compared to eating with rectal being the highest
4189,Anybody know the bioavailability of Percocet with an IN ROA?,"Oral bioavailability of oxycodone is much higher than intranasal bioavailability (about 40% higher) and it will last longer as well. You can definitely get a better rush from snorting it, however that’s only if you’re working with pills that have NO acetaminophen. With that rush comes a faster comedown, however. Generally you can think of drugs with the shortest half-lives having the strongest but also shortest peak.

With the amount of fillers along with the acetaminophen, you’re going about this so inefficiently and honestly you’re just wasting it at this point. Oral BA is already 85-90% as opposed to 50-55!"

4196,Anybody know the bioavailability of Percocet with an IN ROA?,"You can do it, but I wouldn’t advise it. I snorted Norcos back in the day.

You’re be snorting close to a gram worth of powder that burns like a motherfucker, trying to get 5mg of oxy into your bloodstream. Some of that 5mg is never gonna make it, and then the bioavailability of the rest is only about 50%. So ultimately you’re going to completely fuck up your sinuses for at least a day for 2mg of oxy, at most. Even with a low tolerance, you probably won’t feel it.

Just eat anything with APAP in it. Not worth snorting it."

I took another one on my drive home from school and my boyfriend at the time was graduating the police academy that night. his friend ryan came to pick me up and i was so high, i started to feel drooly and sick like i was going to puke. while reaching out to roll the window down, i threw up in my mouth and kept my mouth closed to try to wait so i could puke out the window and it was just too much and I spewed vomit all over ryans truck. inside. everywhere. anyways, thats my morphine story.

And no I don't live in the US, but my doctor assured me it wasn't as high of a dose as other patients and that's why I'm shocked I'm actually so high up there wow. I'm from Switzerland so I don't need to worry about insurance, it's one of the reasons I'm unable to move because my meds would be insanely expensive in some other countries such as the US

But wait, you're having morphine XR as pain relief though? OK well I didn't think about this before, but in my case it's substitution treatment. In my country, we don't use subs, only morphine XR and methadone. And in my case we opted for morphine. It's to medically control my opiate usage and steer me clear from withdrawal indefinitely. So that's probably why the dosage is exponentially higher. 

I will say one thing though. Oxycodone is never prescribed here, I've never seen or heard any doctor talk about it, not one user use it and have never seen them in person aside from when I ordered some a long time ago. So that's something you guys have, along with hydro and opana."

All of a sudden you hear a dog bark. The next thing you know you hear smashing glass and a deafening noise. A flash of blinding white light causes disorientation as the flash bang grenade detonates. The tinnitus and loss of equilibrium only confuses you further. 

You vaguely recall hearing “DEA” & “POLICE” and “SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!” As your vision returns, you find yourself pinned to the ground, black clad men who present a very intimidating and aggressive demeanour, pointing assault rifles at you and a salivating and barking German shepherd that looks like it needs a good feed and is eyeing you off as an appetizer. 

The neighbours mill around outside as you are led away in chains, like a circus animal from the 1800’s. Wondering to themselves what terrible and heinous crimes the nice young man inside must have committed. They thought you were such a polite and respectful young man. Now their suburban tranquility has been shattered. The war on drugs has claimed the best years of your life as you sit in your cell. Wondering how it all went this wrong.

I stopped ordering international bc it was causing me too much anxiety after several orders. Every time something was late or on the way I’d get really paranoid

As ordering international greatly increases the risks. Especially if you’re ordering large amounts. A blogger named gwern recorded a bunch of statistics about it that you can look at. Maybe if you’re ordering personal amounts you might feel okay continuing to order from Poland. Bc maybe all they would do is seize the drugs and not go after you legally if they were discovered at customs. Idk. I personally think I’m done with international orders as I don’t want to put myself at risk for trouble with law enforcement and heroin is cheap enough near me."

The guy it’s named after (Paddy Uluru) was an aboriginal elder who is on record as saying that he didn’t care if people climbed it, and if they wanted to, he didn’t care. It had no sacred significance. 

It’s a case of “get woke for broke” I reckon. It’s in the middle of fucking nowhere. It’s like the surface of goddamn mars, bugs the size of your head and bloody hot. 

I mean, it’s a big rock in the middle of nowhere. There’s one TWICE the size in Western Australia which is heaps nicer. Take your tourist dollars there. Plus you can climb that one. 

Watch the numbers and cash dry up, then in a few years they’ll reopen it, BUT you’ll have to be accompanied by an aboriginal guide to ensure “appropriate cultural sensitivity” or some shit. Then they’ll charge ya $1000 for the privilege. Money always wins. 

I’ll shuddup now."

4310,I'm sure it's been asked 100 times but what's up with ultram?,"If you are used to m-boxes then it won't do a whole lot for you in terms of an opiate rush. Unlike other opioids, you CANNOT take more than 400 mg in one day, unless you enjoy having seizures and getting super sick. The tramadol itself has SSRI properties so you get a two fold effect.. antidepressant and opioid-ish.  If you do end up taking the Ultram and not plain tramadol, you must take into account the acetaminophen in the tabs, too.  


The short of it is.. Yes, they can make you feel ok. Many folks that I know, myself included, felt a little speedy effect from them, rather than the traditional nodding out business you get with some opi's.  In my case,  I had seizures at doses as low as 200 mg. IF you are currently on any other type of SSRI or SNRI drugs (sertraline, dextromethorphan, prozac...etc) or even OTC supplements like St. Johns Wort, stay away from the Ultram as you will be at an increased risk for serotonin syndrome,  which, can be fatal if not treated."

4396,The drug war turned a small amount of opium eaters/smokers into carfentanil? Russian Roulette players with sky high tolerance!,"Yes. Drug prohibition naturally brings worst, more dangerous and terrifying drugs into the scene. This is something that repeats itself again and again.

1. Opium prohibition made a bunch of chineses migrate to IV heroin. Heroin flooded the streets of China after opium was banned. A bunch of opium smokers started injecting morphine and heroin, and because of that thousands died from blood poisoning.
2. If people could get access to cheap legal cocaine hydrochloride in the 80s, maybe there would be no advent of crack cocaine, a cheap alternative to expensive illicit cocaine salt. This is because poor people turned to crack because it was the form of cocaine that was available to then, because it was cheap, whereas cocaine salt from the black market was expensive af, rich people's drug. Cocaine in itself is ridiculously cheap and simple to produce, so it could very easily be regulated in a way that it would remain cheap in the legal market. Thus, there wouldn't be no need for a cheap alternative, like crack.
3. Just like crack became a thing as an alternative to cocaine, ""oxi"" and ""merla"", which are forms of cocaine base even worse than crack itself became a thing in Brazil. And that could also be avoided by the legalization of cocaine freebase.
4. When Putin started enforcing major restrictions related to heroin, the price of the drug raised and a bunch of poor users in Russia turned to desomorphine, a cheaper alternative. Desomorphine is stronger and more addictive than heroin. Desomorphine wears off in three hours, so it's like it has only half the duration of heroin, which wears off in five hours. Thus, desomorphine users need to redose even more compulsively. Also, those were junkies producing desomorphine from codeine pills, not profissional chemists in a controlled setting. The impurities that used to end up in desomorphine, resulted from the poor synthesis method, made the skin of the users rot. Just look for ""krokodil"" in Google Images. This disaster would be completely avoided if users had access to cheap clean pharma heroin.
5. Ever heard of flakka? The drug that makes it's users look like they're possessed by a demon? The drug that turns normal students into insane people? Well, it turns out flakka is a cheap alternative to cocaine, and I seriously doubt there would be any significant demand for it if cocaine users could get access to cheap pure coke.
6. Fent analogues. Fent is way more profitable than heroin, so we're seeing fent analogues drugs taking heroin and oxycodone's place. But those drugs are way stronger than heroin and oxy, and thus tens of thousands of opioid users are dying every year. Each one of those deaths could be easily avoided if users could get access to cheap pharma heroin or oxycodone.

This is the nature of prohibition.

I eventually saved some but I can't locate the one I liked the best. But if you're interested, here's one I did save....



The vast majority of problems related to drugs are the cause of Drug Prohibition, not the drugs themselves.

Fatal and non-fatal overdoses caused by inconsistent quality, unknown potency, unknown ingredients, prepared in unregulated ""labs"", drug cartel and gang violence, incredibly expensive leading to increased theft and violence for addicts to maintain their addiction (versus alcohol/cigarette addiction), limited amount of accurate information and understanding regarding effects of various drugs and the actual causes of and solutions to addiction, increased difficulty to get help to stop using, funding terrorism in South America, Middle East and by the CIA, costing hundreds of billions of tax dollars with 0 positive impact on society, jailing millions of people for using/selling ... The list could go on and on.

The problems that are actually caused by the drugs themselves...

Unintentional fatal and non-fatal overdoses (a much smaller proportion than those caused by a lack of regulation/etc. as described above), increased tolerance, physical dependence causing uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking the drug, temporarily relieving underlying mental health issues instead of confronting them and trying to work through them, etc.

The most important takeaway from this is that Drug Prohibition causes a large number of problems and solves literally ZERO problems. Cops seize less than 1% of the drugs that are smuggled into the US. And spend ~$85 billion every year on police, prosecution and prison. The estimated street value of all drugs that come into the US each year is ~$115 billion. With a decent bulk buy discount, the government could get everyone as high as they wanted to be all year for what they spend wasting their resources on Drug Prohibition which literally do absolutely nothing to benefit society.

If all drugs were legalized tomorrow with a 10% tax that goes directly into a fund for treatment, research and education related to drugs and addiction, within a decade we'd see a massive drop in ODs, violence, theft and addiction itself. Drug Prohibition is just as useless and counterproductive as Alcohol Prohibition was."

- stop incarcerating users
- stop the horrible cycle of for profit rehab and the Facebook pages masquerading as help groups that cycle people to these rehabs to make money (they literally will give the addict a hotel and dope money, tell them what to say, and then get a kick back - then, when the guy gets out of rehab, the scumbag will contact him and offer to do it all over again)
- start making MAT therapy more avaliable and for free (seems like all the pill Mills chnaged into sub clinics that charge hella money) (and methadone clinics need to be willing to give take homes sooner if they want those of us with professional jobs to consider it)
- start offering MAT in prison that then carries over after they get our (see: Rhode island prisons for a prime good example)
- be more open to safe injection sites and allow needle sales in all states (and allow needle exchange in all states) even if you don't like the idea, you save money on hospital bills with these facilities
- realize that people on opiates only do the scumbag things they do because a drug that costs a few dollars a day has been marked up to a few hundred dollars a day due to the black market
- therefore, safe access clinics need to be a part of treating this epidemic
- heavily think about allowing the purchase of clean drugs from state run facilities
- reduce deamonization of those who actually need a script and remove ass backward morphine equivalent limits.  This drug just doesn't work like that. 
- realize that by taking these steps, you remove sketchy, often exploitive dealers and cartels, and prevent deaths with known product purity.  I guarantee hardly anyone would opt for fent if they could buy pure heroin or oxy at it's true cost
- offer free counseling to anyone who wants it.  So often drug use has a tie to something in someone's life that needs resolving. 
- work to reduce the stigma that junkies are somehow lessor people.  1 in 5 people has an opiate problem.  Most people know more than five people.  Think about that.  

And so many more.  To me, the fixes all makes so much sense, but it goes against America's puritanical background.  People are perverse here and enjoy seeing people suffer over things like this.  Just how America hates the poor (sorry, future millionaires). 

The funny part is, I don't really think we should treat the meth problem this way.  Opis are not destructive to long term brain functioning and don't cause temporary psychosis on a regular basis.  It's already a cheap drug and purity is sky high.  I'd be open to more arguments about it but I'm on the fence. 

I do think we should legalize cocaine, tho."

And so many more.  To me, the fixes all makes so much sense, but it goes against America's puritanical background.  People are perverse here and enjoy seeing people suffer over things like this.  Just how America hates the poor (sorry, future millionaires). 

The funny part is, I don't really think we should treat the meth problem this way.  Opis are not destructive to long term brain functioning and don't cause temporary psychosis on a regular basis.  It's already a cheap drug and purity is sky high.  I'd be open to more arguments about it but I'm on the fence.

Everyone's drugs SHOULD be free, just because one person gets something doesn't mean other people shouldn't.  HOWEVER that was not the point I was trying to make.  I suppose I mean - affordable and possibly free/very low cost if your income puts you within poverty levels.  Could just be a classic sliding scale.  I don't think it's the drug cost itself that I take too much offense to, rather the crazy amount of MAT doctors that only take cash and charge high rates.  I know people paying $300 and more to be in a MAT program per month.  That's ridiculous.

Please, go look at the rhode island correctional system MAT program.  They've been doing MAT in jail for a while now and have reported savings across the board, as well as much lower recidivism.  The program they sign up for in jail follows them out, and the day they walk out, they have the location list of all the offices outside prison and the offices already have their info/history.  Their visits to these clinics are FREE and the medication is free or low cost.  People are not up in arms over this.  A person stable on MAT going to work and paying taxes is contributing FAR more than the small cost of their treatment.  They have access to councillors too.

Have you heard of sliding scale mental health?  Many providers base your fee based on your income, and they exist in every major city/state.  It's not a new concept.

I typed that first message on my phone, so I should have made it more clear that for people with the means to pay for treatment, they should do so, but that cost should be reasonable.  If you're broke, I think you should still get services at either a vastly reduced or free level.

I understand that maybe I'm a little pie in the sky, but there are states with programs in place like this - the problem is they are few and far between and theres no standardization.

I believe many social costs would come down - it's expensive to keep someone in prison, it's expensive to not have them work and pay taxes, it's expensive when they go to the ER over an abscess or heart infection or tons of other things (it's not like they pay those bills, we cover that indirectly), it's expensive to pay the police to arrest the same people over and over, and I think it's cruel to let people withdraw in jail.  We give them clonidine and other drugs so we can afford to give them subs.  There was also an interesting paper that said, more or less, that MAT in prisons reduced prison violence a great deal."

ive heard of sliding scale mental health but when i looked into it in my own area i couldnt get a counselor/therapist for under 100$ a visit which was way unaffordable for me. 

and lastly about the people withdrawing in jail.. yeah its awful. i guess in a way if we break the law we know the possible consequences so its what we get. but plenty of drug users in jail are non violent people who aer non criminals beside the ""crime"" related to their drug use. i recently kicked sub, benzos, and gaba in jail and i got nothing for it. they also refused me my antibiotics i got from the hospital the day prior. i stopped seeing the nurse that first day because i learned they emptied the cash from my wallet and put it on my commissary, and that if i got any meds or care they will take my money away. the system is a mess."

The problem with decriminalization, is you need to include small dealers too.  Most of those are just middles/small users themselves working to feed their habit.  

Ive already conceded that all I was wrong about gatekeeping meth.  I think the warnings need to be a different nature (ala on the back of cig packages in some places)

Like liquor or Tobacco, an age would be heavily enforced.  Also limits would be enforced like liquor.

States already limit the amount or marijuana one can buy.

I think people that would rather shut out life and get lost in a drug need help more with their life than with the drugs.  I love my life - I use but would never throw it away if my DoC were free.  In fact, I'd go back to having lots more money to do the things I love even more.

4416,"Yes. Drug prohibition naturally brings worst, more dangerous and terrifying drugs into the scene. This is something that repeats itself again and again.

1. Opium prohibition made a bunch of chineses migrate to IV heroin. Heroin flooded the streets of China after opium was banned. A bunch of opium smokers started injecting morphine and heroin, and because of that thousands died from blood poisoning.
2. If people could get access to cheap legal cocaine hydrochloride in the 80s, maybe there would be no advent of crack cocaine, a cheap alternative to expensive illicit cocaine salt. This is because poor people turned to crack because it was the form of cocaine that was available to then, because it was cheap, whereas cocaine salt from the black market was expensive af, rich people's drug. Cocaine in itself is ridiculously cheap and simple to produce, so it could very easily be regulated in a way that it would remain cheap in the legal market. Thus, there wouldn't be no need for a cheap alternative, like crack.
3. Just like crack became a thing as an alternative to cocaine, ""oxi"" and ""merla"", which are forms of cocaine base even worse than crack itself became a thing in Brazil. And that could also be avoided by the legalization of cocaine freebase.
4. When Putin started enforcing major restrictions related to heroin, the price of the drug raised and a bunch of poor users in Russia turned to desomorphine, a cheaper alternative. Desomorphine is stronger and more addictive than heroin. Desomorphine wears off in three hours, so it's like it has only half the duration of heroin, which wears off in five hours. Thus, desomorphine users need to redose even more compulsively. Also, those were junkies producing desomorphine from codeine pills, not profissional chemists in a controlled setting. The impurities that used to end up in desomorphine, resulted from the poor synthesis method, made the skin of the users rot. Just look for ""krokodil"" in Google Images. This disaster would be completely avoided if users had access to cheap clean pharma heroin.
5. Ever heard of flakka? The drug that makes it's users look like they're possessed by a demon? The drug that turns normal students into insane people? Well, it turns out flakka is a cheap alternative to cocaine, and I seriously doubt there would be any significant demand for it if cocaine users could get access to cheap pure coke.
6. Fent analogues. Fent is way more profitable than heroin, so we're seeing fent analogues drugs taking heroin and oxycodone's place. But those drugs are way stronger than heroin and oxy, and thus tens of thousands of opioid users are dying every year.

4418,"Yes. Drug prohibition naturally brings worst, more dangerous and terrifying drugs into the scene. This is something that repeats itself again and again.

1. Opium prohibition made a bunch of chineses migrate to IV heroin. Heroin flooded the streets of China after opium was banned. A bunch of opium smokers started injecting morphine and heroin, and because of that thousands died from blood poisoning.
2. If people could get access to cheap legal cocaine hydrochloride in the 80s, maybe there would be no advent of crack cocaine, a cheap alternative to expensive illicit cocaine salt. This is because poor people turned to crack because it was the form of cocaine that was available to then, because it was cheap, whereas cocaine salt from the black market was expensive af, rich people's drug. Cocaine in itself is ridiculously cheap and simple to produce, so it could very easily be regulated in a way that it would remain cheap in the legal market. Thus, there wouldn't be no need for a cheap alternative, like crack.
3. Just like crack became a thing as an alternative to cocaine, ""oxi"" and ""merla"", which are forms of cocaine base even worse than crack itself became a thing in Brazil. And that could also be avoided by the legalization of cocaine freebase.
4. When Putin started enforcing major restrictions related to heroin, the price of the drug raised and a bunch of poor users in Russia turned to desomorphine, a cheaper alternative. Desomorphine is stronger and more addictive than heroin. Desomorphine wears off in three hours, so it's like it has only half the duration of heroin, which wears off in five hours. Thus, desomorphine users need to redose even more compulsively. Also, those were junkies producing desomorphine from codeine pills, not profissional chemists in a controlled setting. The impurities that used to end up in desomorphine, resulted from the poor synthesis method, made the skin of the users rot. Just look for ""krokodil"" in Google Images. This disaster would be completely avoided if users had access to cheap clean pharma heroin.
5. Ever heard of flakka? The drug that makes it's users look like they're possessed by a demon? The drug that turns normal students into insane people? Well, it turns out flakka is a cheap alternative to cocaine, and I seriously doubt there would be any significant demand for it if cocaine users could get access to cheap pure coke.
6. Fent analogues. Fent is way more profitable than heroin, so we're seeing fent analogues drugs taking heroin and oxycodone's place. But those drugs are way stronger than heroin and oxy, and thus tens of thousands of opioid users are dying every year. Each one of those deaths could be easily avoided if users could get access to cheap pharma heroin or oxycodone.

This is the nature of prohibition.

Edit: Wow. 1 Award. Thank you. :D Can I exchange it for dope..?","I hate to criticise when I'm very much with your general point, but let me share some observations for clarity's sake:  


I've noticed that it seems everyone's new default explanation for why they ODed was that they got fent. It's just the natural scapegoat at this point... and much worse, many users incorrectly believe if fent is going around, they are necessarily playing russian roulette and that it's unavoidable, etc. That's always absolute bullshit. There isn't a toxin or poison on earth you can protect against by starting very small and working up..

Carfentanil is, by some miracle of science, no more deadily as poison than fentanyl itself, or it is at least quite to be sure. 

Both of these drugs might be very reasonable choices if they were accessible in a standardized, safe formulation... IME they cause somewhat reduced side effects compared to morphine or something of it's ilk. Also their range of half-lifes can make them more useful for special concerns, like when you want to take a nap with some help from an opi high, yet prefer to sober up ASAP afterwards, regular fent would be fitting. There's also remifent for those who like to 20min micro-breaks... Finally carfent for when you want use only one per day...

Also, infections from IV use are virtually always a symptom of lack of knowledge, lack of caution, lack of access to resources. Sterilization is the simplest thing ever. Near-Boiling water (or in general any heat near wity, alcohol, bleach, hydrogen peroxide etc will all sterilize your needle and syringe; as long as you make all the relevant surfaces inside and on the needle itself have been in contact with you cleaning agent. Of course on top of that if you used anything other than the near boiling water, flush out the syringe a few times with water that has been boiled recently

I mean basic first aid will cover that for anyone other than those with immune issues preexisting.

It's definitely been a problem. Less so now that codeine is Rx only and it's harder to make Kroc (badly synthesized deso), but it was. Read medical journal reports. There have been instances where a person injects Kroc one time, never again, and develops deep lesions at the site which do not heal, but rather spread, and require serious medical treatment. There's significant medical and journalistic evidence that necrosis and other severe bodily damage is a near-always Kroc effect. Life expectancy of an addict is 2-3 years. I've been doing a TON of research on the situation recently. This is serious shit.

Deso, in old clinical trials, was found to create strong dependency after approximately a week of moderate daily use. I have no idea if that's normal. Side effects are numerous and nasty, you can research that if you like. It was used legally in Russia and a few other countries in the 50s (?), but soon replaced with drugs with less side effects.

Also, it does have a short half life, wearing off by some counts in 90 mins, others 3 hours. Regardless, it lasts shorter than heroin. It makes sense that an addict would dose up more often. 

You're absolutely right that true deso doesn't have all the nasty necrosis causing effects. However, home cooking of it was extremely common, especially in poorer industrial neighborhoods. This consists of codeine, which was OTC, and then a ton of binding agents and whatnot that changed the chemical structure and increased potency. This includes a mixture of HCl, Iodine, Red Phosphorus (scraped from matchboxes), gasoline, and paint thinner. Phosphorus in particular essentially poisons the user. These additives are consistently used and contribute directly to rotting skin and other serious bodily effects. I've read multiple medical reports detailing the common problems, such as gums rotting to expose the jawbone (there's some formal name I forgot), and their suspected or known chemical causes. This is not scare tactic. This is reality. 

Russia didn't engineer jack shit. They didn't fix the issue quickly because they couldn't; drug addiction is seen as a nationalism and moral problem. Besides, their various police agencies were locked in a turf war surrounding drugs, the most engineering they were doing was restricting heroin so much that they accidentally forced a more deadly opiate. It's just a terrible example of how drug wars fail everyone. 

Russia does have a lot of access to heroin, theoretically. However, since heroin is seen as a international issue and conflated with nationalism, there were hard, hard measures taken to preventing heroin trafficking, and clearly they worked for a time. Unfortunately. I'm forgetting this part of my research now, but Russia *is* definitely poised to play a big part in the distribution and purchase of Afghani opiates. I don't remember what the change was. 

Aaaalso, no one was really cooking up deso on a large scale, it was mostly small scale cookhouses. Just...a lot of them. Heroin was accessible, but extremely expensive in comparison"

If you snort it and miss the membranes, it'll shoot down to your stomach and you'll get the oral bioavailability rate.

4459,Yep. The oral bioavailability for morphine is around 30% and rectally can be up to 70% so you absorb a higher percentage of the drug,Yeah cool. I mean what’s the best way to prep the boof?
4460,Yeah cool. I mean what’s the best way to prep the boof?,I crush it up and mix it with water into an oral syringe. Insert tip in a bit and release the morphine/water solution. What I do is I lie on my side so it gets properly absorbed I usually do it for 20 min. You should feel more of a rush that way

4462,"U do it for 20 mins straight? I thought it was like a shot, quick in, and that’s it? U go on ur side so it doesn’t dribble out?",Yeah you have to let it absorb so you lay on your side so it doesn’t come out. Correct
4463,Yeah you have to let it absorb so you lay on your side so it doesn’t come out. Correct,"Sorry to keep msging l. So I’m straight. U actually lay for 20 mins as you pump it in ? Or you squirt it in, and lay for 20 min?
Going to try tomorrow"
4464,"Sorry to keep msging l. So I’m straight. U actually lay for 20 mins as you pump it in ? Or you squirt it in, and lay for 20 min?

There's a lot of misinformation around addicts, but by and large the public perception of them is the perception of the worst 10%. Not just addicts we do this with a lot of things.

Also partly it can be a sort of weakness on their part. People need to compare their actions to others. I don't think that's weak necessarily but people tend to be more favourable to things they do and less favourable to things others do, with less regard to the actual act being judged, which is a bit weak. My point being you could quite easily judge someone for not having a job, or ODing in your house etc etc. But simply using opiates not so much. Except for something unpredictable like heroin, in which case fair enough, like previous poster said no one wants to deal with the risk of someone ODing."

4484,They werent great freinds in the beginning then. My Freinds have stuck through me passed 2 years even though they dont partake or understand why i do what i do.,"I think they were good friends. It was a bit my fault too. After I relapsed after rehab, where they were very understanding. But after the relapse I started to not respond for days/weeks etc. I was on a extreme benzo and H binge for a few month. I constantly nodded through the day. Ate nearly nothing. Mom crying. All that bullshit."
4485,Why are people or friends abondon you once they find out that you use/used?,"As someone who bared with it for a while then dipped on one of my friends (I did tell them straight up why though), for me it's because it felt kind of traumatizing to watch them destroy themselves so hard, and it quickly becomes a matter of why am I hanging out with this person anymore. Life's hard enough for most people, that's why people end up doing drugs. Why would they want to spend their energy on someone who no longer offers any kind of substantial interaction and puts their life at risk (at least in a way).

I'm loyal so I did try to keep with my friends who were struggling, and when I was tired of their shit I'd tell them exactly what my problem was, but at the end of the day if they don't change eventually somethings gotta give. I don't want to be friends with corpses."
4486,Why are people or friends abondon you once they find out that you use/used?,"This happened to me- one was a good friend of over a decade, the other a best friend for nearly a decade (who I even lived with in college). Both are drug users of harder drugs like cocaine (one even was a meth addict for a few years).!The second friend knew I was using for a while and seemed ok with it as it never affected my ability to be a good/reliable person. Then our little social circle hit some turbulence when we all worked on an art project together. The two “friends” decided to throw me under the bus, using my addiction to demonize me. It was awful. They outted my addiction to so many people, trying to  make me look like a POS. They also stole my bfs artwork and took credit for it. The ironic part is, they threw me under the bus mostly bc they were jealous that other people in that scene preferred working with me and wanted to work with me instead of them on future art projects. That couldn’t happen tho, (god forbid they take any responsibility for their own actions) so they told everyone I was junkie scum to not be trusted. I posted a more detailed account of this if you go through my history. The only positive part was that I met my current bf in this drama and we’ve had a great relationship since.

This stigma sucks really bad , some people will try to act concerned but it’s really just condescending bullshit."

No more feeling like that ever again unless I want too.. and If I can push through that bullshit, I will no longer be held a slave to that chemical and all the shit that comes with it... ie the stress of having to find something, the financial stress, always wondering 'will today be the day I get caught or OD' ... It I can push past this, what are some of the things I will be able to do with the money I save from not having to spend it all on dope? How happy will my family and friends be to see the ""me"" that they know and love?

The things he used to do and mix and all the situations we were put in, I’m honestly amazed he’s still alive. I for sure thought I would get a call from his mom shortly after we broke up that he had died (he’s also wrecked I think 3 different cars due to nodding off at the wheel - his parents enable him greatly to this day I have no doubt).  Anyway, I do wish him well. I don’t want to be his friend or have his toxicity in my life though.","Kevin, who's now serving a 3 year prison sentence. I don't blame him, I did have free will."

4544,"Who first introduced you to opioids, and where are they now?","Looking back, I really don't think opiates/opioids were prevalent in the drug scene when my friends nd I were experimenting. It was alcohol, pot, opium, hash, acid, coke, speed etc. My first taste/experience with opies was an rx for T3's 🙄"
4545,"Who first introduced you to opioids, and where are they now?","My ex husband gave me some of his script (he got oxy and methadone for migraines and chronic daily headache) because I had left vet school and was super depressed, so he was like here this will make you feel happy, instead of ya know getting me actual help to deal with my depression. Before that I had done his and his family members pills a few times and I was the “good kid” in school so I didn’t party or anything before college. 

I don’t know where he is now or what he’s doing. He was in Texas last I knew (think he’s still there) and I recently got a bill for him about an ambulance ride so I don’t know if he is still using and ODed or it was for something else. 

I’ve been clean now 2 years after a 10 year run"

my ex is in jail and the roommate failed out of uni."

4551,"Who first introduced you to opioids, and where are they now?","One of my good good friends. He would spend weeks at a time living on my couch while I was a senior in college. Gave me a quarter of an oxy80 one night in 2008 and my life changed forever.

He's now 6 ft under. Not from opiates though, from a car crash. 3 years ago. I'm still fucking shook thinking about those texts I got from my sister about it. Rip my friend."

The plug I met was another female and we quickly became best using buddies for years.  I had her back if she ran out of dope before work or something and she had mine. We would share clean points, boost shit together and just generally look out for one another. 

Anyway,... She entered a methadone clinic probably 5 years ago or so.  I followed suit not long ago, finally got clean after a few years there.  It didnt stick for me though. Still using. For her, shes long clean, off methadone and doing great. We still talk and I'm so proud and happy for her, it's the first time in her adult life shes been sober!"

4556,"Who first introduced you to opioids, and where are they now?","My brother gave me some to get through a bad migraine, I didn’t realize he was addicted at the time.  That was my first experience and it was amazing.  I never did it again until years later and then it because more and more in between, my choice, of course."
4557,"Who first introduced you to opioids, and where are they now?",My best friend of 19 years introduced me. He was an oxy addict before I met him but now just uses opiates a few times a year. We are still close friends. He just got married and I was the flower girl for the wedding!

4562,Should I be quiet if BF is Clean?,"I’d bring it up in a non-accusatory way since it’s good to have an open dialogue, but I wouldn’t equate suboxone (no matter the route of ingestion) with using dope. And definitely don’t count the pills, you’re not his mother."
4563,Should I be quiet if BF is Clean?,"...the fuck?  Count his Suboxone.  If he’s shooting the Suboxone, he’s a tard and you got to get in front of that shit.  Count the Subs and see if he’s using those.  If he’s not, he’s using using and you have that confirmed and can be like “What the fuck?”"

4566,Should I be quiet if BF is Clean?,"You have a right to talk about it, you also have the right to stay and help if he is, or move on. You have to understand that a partner who continues to use IV and/or lie about it will have long term repercussions on your life. You shouldn’t feel bad wanting to talk about it, being worried about it, and making informed decisions about your future. It’s usually easier said than done, but those are the baseline facts. A relationship is a two way street. I would say the bathroom time is indicative of shady behavior. That’s actually how my SO caught me originally.


Yes, shooting up anything is not good for recovery."
4567,Should I be quiet if BF is Clean?,I honestly thought I was going to get back lash and it was going to be viewed as nothing of significance. Thank you for validating my concern and the boost I needed to get the dialogue going around this issue. Thank you all <3

He said he wants to stop and I asked if going to meeting would help, or wanted me to be around when he took the medication to keep him accountable, and he said no, that he would just throw away the needles and be done with it. I plan on keeping an open dialogue with him around how the progress is going, and hope that this doesn’t lead to him being more sneaky in the future. It sounded like he genuinely thought it was pointless to continue doing it. I think that there must be a mind body connection and that part of the addiction is habit and must get something out of it by going thru the motions. Is there anything that helped you personally or would have liked someone to do for you?"
4571,Should I be quiet if BF is Clean?,I think youre justified in your worry about shooting subs. That shit isnt good for you and bad behavior. I would talk to him about it.. But not in a super angry way.
4572,Fate?,"Dude, if you have 5 years clean, don’t do a shot now.  You been out the game a minute and with the shit on the streets these days, good chance that shot drops your ass.  I’m sure you’ve dealt with other hardships in those 5 years, use the sober skills you’ve acquired, cope not dope."
4573,Fate?,"Don’t do it! It will NOT help the situation and will only partially numb the pain for a few hours. My younger brother died of a heroin OD a little over 3 years ago. I cannot explain the pain I felt, I couldn’t even mention his name without crumbling for at least a year. So I can understand how you feel. I’m not religious, but I’d like to think that the ones that have passed on can still know what we’re doing somehow (though that may sound ridiculous). They wouldn’t want you to spiral. Do better for them, if not for yourself."
4574,Fate?,"Jesus, no one here would blame you, but can you get something else going? Heroin is not the answer to anything, it’s just a nice feeling that if you really think about it isn’t even that great. It makes you constantly have to think about it and build you’re life around it. Look there are other relationships out there, plenty of fish in the sea. You’re dog died, but all dogs go to heaven. And as far as your grandparents; that truly sucks but they wouldn’t want you doing heroin. In fact they’d want you clean, healthy and happy. Besides mercury is in retrograde, it’s not fate just the planets fucking with you bringing old shit into your life. Choose wisely."
4575,Fate?,Have fun (: if you do it.. Make it short and dont fall down the hole. And be careful!
4576,Fate?,"Damn brotha, all i can say is im pullin for ya, stay clean. Make your grandmothers and pupper proud. Idk. I know its hard."
4577,Fate?,"Don’t do it. I lost my Aunt to the shit, and I almost lost my Mom. I had to suffer watching my Mom OD in the middle of the grocery store when I was 13 and get carted off to the hospital from it. She has now been 10+ years clean. Don’t look back on old habits. It’s not worth it."

Kratom is what I recommend the most, you're not going to be allowed to stay on opiates forever most likely.  Maybe 10 years from now when they realize the thousands of suicides they've caused by being so restrictive with opiates, you'll get your meds.

4615,"I obviously don’t know you or your medical situation - and frankly this isn’t really answering your question. But they most likely are doing that for your own good. Opiates are a prison.

Also, if you have any issues what so ever with your liver, take a very hard pass on that stuff. It can cause serious liver damage when taken in large doses or even smaller doses over a longer period of time. I have had luck with tinctures and with the Yogi brand Tea.. there is also the raw ground or shredded root that can be purchased at herbal shops or even online.

4663,How long?,I literally feel nothing i don’t know
4664,How long?,"Well I guess that depends on your tolerance. While I’m not familiar with that pill personally I do know it should be equivalent to taking a single 5mg norco every 3 hours. Majority of no tolerance people would most likely not feel anything and if they did it would be slight pain relief and zero euphoria.

Back in my younger days I’d have to take 4 Vicodin to feel good. With the way that pill is supposed to work you would need at least 4 of them.  

If you had more and were looking to feel good on them then I’d suggest taking one cutting it in half, if 20mg would even be enough, and letting sit in a cup of coca-cola overnight, or until the pill looks mostly dissolved. There may be other ways around the time release but again I’m not familiar with that pill but I do know most will be dissolved over time by the acids in coke making them immediately available."

4667,This is so disappointing. I’m in so much pain and fucked,"hey. here to save the day.

this med was hardly prescribed because of all the crap that comes with it. so im gonna let you in on a little secret.

coca-cola. get some. get a lot. you toss those fuckers right in. right? you follow?

the extended release shell dissolves, while the hydrocodone remains encapsulated in the gel matrix, if not partially dissolved and bound to the water in the coke.

what does that mean?

instant release hysingla, is what that means.

dont put more than one pill per bottle. youll likely want the smaller bottles opposed to the cans for easier storage.

HOWEVER.
this process can take a few hours. its been a while, but i wouldnt take it out any quicker than 5. ideally, 10. (aka...how long it takes to dissolve in your stomach. better dissolved coating means better results for you.)

hang in there. prep multiple all at once so youre never ""behind"" and waiting hours for a dose.

goodluck friend. be safe damn you"
4668,How long?,Okay then I just drink the whole coke and should feel it?
4669,Kratom with opiates?,"Just no... I always feel strange in the stomachs if it’s kratom on top of an opiate. If it’s kratom before, it does indeed block the opiate as I smoked an entire bag of H with barely any effects and then from the same batch in the morning I only need a couple of small puffs to be right. Kratom kills opiates for a few days IMO, the opiates jut don’t feel right. I have to wait 2 days to get full effects back. I’ve done it both ways numerous times now and it never ends well."
4670,Kratom with opiates?,On the days I knew I would be getting pills I would do my best to not take any kratom or a small amount. It kinda kills the high in my opinion. But kratom after knocking 4-10s back my add some good effects.
4671,Kratom with opiates?,"I've read it blocks the opioid receptors. The other day I took Kratom, then my opioid dose 6 hours later and it fel like it hit fully"
4672,Kratom with opiates?,I feel like that would be just like putting sprinkles on ice cream...sprinkles don’t really add anything so why?
4673,I feel like that would be just like putting sprinkles on ice cream...sprinkles don’t really add anything so why?,The texture of sprinkles is why most people use them.
4674,Kratom with opiates?,"IMO If you take the kratom first it takes away from the high, and taking them after is a bit better, but I'd still rather take just the opiates, the stimulant aspect of kratom takes away from the comfy feeling for me"
4675,Kratom with opiates?,"I’ve read a lot on here that’s says the Kratom blocks to opiate. But in my experience it’s about timing and order. If I take the pills, norco, and then about an hour and a half later take some kratom it tends to work out well. As the hydrocodone would start to wear off the Kratom kicks in and makes the effect last longer.

Now where the blocking come into play is if you try doing them at the same time. I’ve also had no problems feeling a dose of hydro after 3hrs of first feeing the effects of Kratom. For me it usually takes about an hour to feel the Kratom so I guess that be roughly 4 hrs after dosing but there are times it take 1 1/2 hours to feel it and other I feel it within 30 min and you need at least 3 hours after feeling the Kratom otherwise yes it does dull the effect of the opiate.

The other thing is if you have a decent tolerance, example:need 40mg or more of hydrocodone, then chances are the Kratom will have almost no positive effects and will only have the blocking effect be noticed."
4676,Kratom with opiates?,Smoking cigarettes on a nicotine patch
4677,Kratom with opiates?,"Kratom (~10g) 6 hours before 8mg of IV dilaudid made me get a slight high, similar to 5 or 10mg of IV oxy. NOT WORTH IT. My stomach normally jumps at 8mg dilly and I get hit with bliss for an hour. None of that at 8mg after kratom. I wanted to redose literally minutes after doing a shot."
4678,Kratom with opiates?,Fuckkkkkk kratom
4679,How much codine to get a good high?,"I’m not sure but I believe roughly 10% of the codeine turns into morphine. So if you took 120 mg you should have something close to 10-12 mg morphine. I think the ceiling effect for codeine is 240mg. I would take the full 240, that’s what I always did when I was in high school, sadly graduated to heroin but I’m getting better"

But for others, even less, and the lucky ""ultra metabolizers"" can get much more out of it.  That's the trouble with pro-drugs, you can't be certain how much is actually going to be absorbed.

4696,Duoxetine and Doxepin for WDs?,"Doxepin is about as useful as benedryl to me. Makes me feel similar and has similar mental effects, I know it’s supposed to be good for nerve pain, but I’d rather just take aleve, Advil or weed. Clonidine is very useful and seroquel is useful if you can’t sleep. On seroquel I’d suggest almost micro dosing if you don’t have a tolerance, like 10 mg and work you’re way from there if you need more. Not because it’s unsafe, just because it can give you a “zombie hangover” for the first week of taking it. I personally love seroquel as a mental health aid the solid sleep adds up to a good mood and it used to potentiate everything/life (except psychedelics)wonderfully, but that’s besides the point. You got some good stuff to block the experience and if you threw some kratom for the Daytime you should turn it around."

The main character was interesting and entirely relatable.  The descriptives were solid but not overly much so.  It just seemed to read smoothly.  I'm by no stretch of the imagination a writer but if this was the first book I ever wrote,  I would feel very proud of myself,  and rightly so. 
I've been to jail a few times,  and for fairly long amounts of time the last few sentences. If I didn't have someone on the street sending me in books and books about thousands of different card games,  ugh... books kept me stay relatively sane for sure.  Of all the hours of nothing at all to do while in jail, reading is one of the greatest  time killers. Educating myself in any amount is just a small bonus.

RJ is a crazy mofo and a shitty friend/boyfriend who is a walking, psychotic disaster.  Sounds like he is starting to develop a new-found sense of like a euphoric adrenaline rush throughout his murder sprees based on how he progressively starts to react heartless, devious and doesn't think twice to take a life like with the convenient store employee after leaving Steve's.

I empathize with Jonah, because he seems to be a genuine, caring and authentic guy, yet misguided with a tortured soul thus self medicating (also losing 3 family members def puts your mind in places unfathomable) although he did piss me off for getting himself involved so deep when he had a few opportunities to get away, or alerting someone when given the chance (like at the Home Depot) completely ignoring any spine he has in him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 that's so crazy that a doctor made a mistake like that. i hope you sued. that's none of my business, but that's something that is so easily avoidable that they should be held accountable. you are lucky you didn't die. i can't imagine chronic osteomylitis. sepsis was brutal just on it's own. i had no energy for like a week after. even walking from my room to my bathroom to shower was an extreme task to which i had no breath and had to sit down in the shower. 

&#x200B;

when ill you find out if it is gone again? i don't know much about it, but why can't the permanently remove it? did the infection fuse to a bone or soemthing? then it just releases toxins every so often? that's just a guess so sorry if it's way off. when do you go back? i wish you good results and i hope you are wrong about it still being there bad right now.

i wish i never even started opiates. my friends dad was a doctor in florida around 2008. it's a long story and not one i want to post on my username because it could incrimnate me. but ya i went straight to snorting them right off the back, then eventually smoking them, then i tried to needle.  this as all over multiple years. it took me like 6-7 years of using before i tried the needle.  i wish i would have just popped them if i did decide i wanted to take them, but mainly i wish i never started. keep your tolerance low. the key is to not worry about ""getting high""

Although it’ll probably still take 20 mins. They used to kill my sex drive, but I’m enough of a perv that I “worked” through it and it doesn’t dampen my libido as much. Most things the body does are either automatic or about conditioning, regardless of having opioids in you’re system or not. You’re CNS can learn to overcome the side effects.

4835,How to support but not enable?,Well it really depends on where she is at and her level of maturity. When I was first coming to grips with this lifelong struggle losing my friends and fam was just the first phase of many. Usually it takes much more than the damage you can do in a month of being strung out to make somebody want to be receptive and willing to quit. When I first began my obsession it was very hard for me to relate with anybody and if people would reach out despite what they heard about me I would end up burning them because I was immature and felt like nobody understood my struggle and therefore deserved to be manipulated. It would have been better had everybody wrote me off from the beginning because I wouldn’t have burned as many bridges. The sad reality is in order to protect yourself your going to need to keep her at arms distance in the sense that you need to realize change can only come from within and it’s very easy for addicts to manipulate loved ones so long as they are susceptible to manipulation.
4836,How to support but not enable?,What you’re already doing is supporting and not enabling. As long as you’re not sending her money etc then all you can do is be there and keep talking how you’re talking and maybe guide her to the solution of getting help/clean if/when she wants it
4837,How to support but not enable?,"The whole concept of enabling is absolute bullshit. Be supportive in whatever way you can. If that means you can help buy some groceries or even throw 20 bucks here and there, that's beyond appreciated. Trust that they are using these drugs for reasons and trust and respect their autonomy. I guarantee that if you react supportive ESPECIALLY when they are using, they will tell you the truth to whatever degree they are comfortable with. Remember, a lot of the world basically doesn't agree with what I just said. Abstinence is idealized. People give us support but it's almost always conditional and not being loved unconditionally is a sure fire way to truly enable me to feel even more alone. Drug use is lonely because stigma destroys our sense of agency to connect as the drugs are used in place of conditional relationships. Theres so much that needs to change but I am just so damn happy you are wanting to find out how to support someone who is using drugs."
4838,How to support but not enable?,"Enabling is doing something that enables her to get high. Buying her drugs, giving her money, driving her to the dealer, etc. It dosent sound like you're doing that at all. Everyone deserves friendship, even heroin addicts. You arent doing anything wrong by just being a friend, in fact, the more alone and isolated addicts get the more deeply they go into their addictions. Continue being her friend, you're doing the right thing"
4839,How to support but not enable?,"This is a tough one my man.

Just continue doing you, be legit, stay her friend if you can, don’t be a judgmental prick (sounds like you’re not so claps and shit).  Don’t give her cash, though, or leave her unattended around your PS4 or power tools.

Can’t tell her to go to rehab or get help, she needs to make that decision on her own.  When she’s ready, though, try to make sure you’re around and still in her life so she has a hand to reach out and grab, even if it’s just for an encouraging “fuck yea, get clean”.

Smart post.  Slick moves.  Respect."
4840,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,[deleted]
4841,[deleted],"This.  In an outpatient program myself cause I have to.  They routinely say stuff that contradicts something they said an hour ago and most of it is super obvious.  One guy nodded the fuck out in our meeting three days ago.  Went for a smoke and came back, passed the fuck out in 5 minutes.   It's mostly BS the courts use to punish people."
4842,[deleted],"Holy fuck dude. 

Agreed with the Second part and sorry about your friend. I’ve lost a lot of people that same way Over the years. Sometimes I feel responsible for turning people out to h. I live 10 mins outside a big city in the south. When oxys were on there way out, I found out how to score h and put a lot of people on because it was just so easy. I FaceTimed with my cousin in prison yesterday. I could tell he was high. This drug shit is really not where I saw my life it’s just crazy. I’m
Better now. Happier. I hope you found some peace too."
4843,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,"If nothing else, rehab helps me get away from the shit for 28+ days, get sleep and mood back on track, and helps improve my recovery foundation. I’ve been to “meh” rehabs but also some excellent ones. The excellent ones had great staff who really cared. 

I also do attend AA because it’s what’s helped me in the past. I’ve developed resentments toward it and other people, but ultimately it’s something f that works for me, when I actually put effort in and want to be clean."

I’ve always been a user who had somewhere to go and when I got into my addiction I never wanted to “hang out” with people. My phone lost was random jays, dirty butts, and dealers."
4845,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,I think rehab is a giant scam. Rehabs operate like a business. They need fresh bodies to fill the room to keep the lights on etc. A lot of rehabs are set up so you can relapse and readmit over and over. So they can charge your insurance over and over and over. With all that being said. The detox aspect of rehab is not a waste of money or time. I had to use a 90 day center when I decided to get clean. Huge waste of time. But I was coming off benzos and opiates so I needed medical detox imo. Plus I've never done super well with detox at home. Anyway I agree with you was my whole point.
4846,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,"Once they get to the point of wanting to rehab, some actually need help. It’s like any other mental health issue, you could end up figuring it out by yourself but might take longer and sometimes you simply can’t afford that time. Everyone’s different."
4847,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,"Not really I think they definitely profit off of people’s addictions but they also aren’t in the business of losing money and they are a business so they need to turn some profit. I think rehab is what you make of it, so yeah if you are determined to not listen and use when you leave you will do that. Some people come in not wanting to get sober and change their minds, some don’t, some come in ready to get sober and relapse immediately. I don’t think many people can “just man up and stop using,” that’s pretty well documented, if it was that easy then why wouldn’t addicts “JUST STOP!” Also for a lot of people it may not get them sober right away but it plants the seed and allows you to learn some things about recovery and addiction"
4848,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,It’s really what you make of it. You can attend all the groups and be a rehab all star and go use the day you get out. You can do nothing in rehab and never attend a meeting and stay clean. I see rehab as time away from your DOC and an environment to relate to others struggling the same way.
4849,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,"It really depends on the rehab and generalizing them all together just isn’t fair. There are 90 day programs that cost $90,000+ that are fantastic and also ones that are bullshit. You also have state-funded programs which cost absolutely nothing that provide housing, medical care/support, transportation, food, counseling, group therapy, and even allow you to get a job and save money before you leave which are fantastic while also having state-funded programs that are just people doing drugs.

You have to do the research and also live somewhere/have the means to go somewhere that is beneficial. This is why it’s so important to focus on harm reduction instead of punishment for addicts. If we made better facilities across the world that anyone could go to, *many* people would actually seek treatment."

4857,Not to mention it just gives you more connects for when you want to say fuck it.,Exactly! Plus I knew all the names and stories of major players. I dropped those and doors flew open.
4858,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,Everything operates on generating a profit. Those in rehab are customers. It’s all about the money.
4859,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,"I think everyones different and needs different thinvs but in the end it's all about the will not the way. 

But yeah in general I agree. Personally Im not with the NA/AA thing or rehabs, but if that's what some one needs, whatever. 

I think the people in a revolving door of AA and 30 day rehabs are nuts. If it hasn't worked that many times, maybe try something else..."
4860,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,Yes. But going to rehab young for benzos when I got arrested has definitely helped me be a more functional opiate user 10 years later.
4861,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,"It really depends on the rehab. 12 step based rehabs tend to be a lot better, and some rehabs are actually run by recovering addicts in long term sobriety, and they’ve seen what seems to work and not work. It’s a very useful resource and it teaches you how to utilize NA and AA meetings as well as the people who attend them. 

I’ve wanted to get clean for a long time, but my best thinking is also the same thinking that got me addicted in the first place. It’s nearly impossible to do it on your own. Having people there to hold you accountable makes a huge difference. I spent 30 days in residential, and as soon as I got out, I was ready to say FUCK IOP and fuck sober living, I bought a meth pipe and was ready to get high. But having people from treatment constantly call me and get on my case, I ended up giving the meth pipe to my house manager before ever using it, and my sponsor helped me snap out of it, and im now another week clean. 

I used to think the exact same thing. That rehabs are money grabs. Little did I know, that was an excuse for me to continue using. My own mind happens to also be my worst enemy."
4862,Any body els think rehab is just a waist of time and money targeted for people trying to help an addict?,"Idk, it helped save my life. Ultimately there is no magical cure for opiate addiction and the onus is on the addict to change."

About 20 mg but it's hit or miss and greatly depends on my pill intake for the day. 30 mg or more is 95% chance of being sick. 20 mg is about 60% and even 10 mg is 25%, all rough numbers. 

I just got that no warning potentiation recipe and it's exactly what I was thinking about doing. Inhibiting my liver enzymes. Going to try it tomorrow.

Tonight I took 5 mg then 30 minutes later 7.5 mg with 0.25 Xanax (I also rapid metabolize and 0.5 makes me black out) then 7.5 mg and 0.25 again with 10 mg Dexedrine 30 minutes later. I plan on taking 5 mg every 30 minutes until I reach a decent high or get sick and stop.

I feel great now but it's not that strong. This is more of an experiment and seems to be working so far. 

Xanax will give me a light buzz for 1 to 1.5 hours then it hits me super hard. It's as if it has been metabolized to another metabolite that I am super sensitive too. No matter what dose I take. 0.25 doesn't give me the 1.5 hour buzz, it just zonks me after the 1.5 hour mark. 

My liver is weird but it's a champ. Morphine works just fine since it skips the cyp.

I'm also prescribed gaba but I hate it. I can't take it because it makes me dumb and my job involves people's lives so I need to be sharp."

4911,Adderall or Dexedrine with the afternoon oxy?,"A better suggestion: Desoxyn (prescribed methamphetamine 5mg tablets). It's only available in generic form now. The 5mg tablets seem at least equal to 10mg of Adderall or dexedrine. It also lasts quite a bit longer than Adderall - about 8 hours.  
Assuming you don't have any on hand though, I would say go with dexedrine. Adderall gives me horrible anxiety and irritability. Wish I had some oxys. Whatever you choose, enjoy!"

one piece of advice: look up the manufacturer formulation of your specific pills to see what the inactive ingredients are. if you see microcrystalline cellulose or talc, you'll want to be aware that each shot will be damaging your body unless you use a micron filter. at the very least, use a tightly bound q-tip cotton to filter (not a cigarette filter), maybe twice, to reduce harm."

Hope it gets resolved. Don't blame you for not wanting to be specific. That's not something we wanna broadcast. Anyway be well bro. Stay safe.
5036,"Do drugs bound for Canada not go through the US anymore?  That’s why they would physically run, even by helicopter, Cocaine and Marijuana back and forth.

I know when you could order the shit online, the pink crap was all over the place.  That all, but dried up a few years back and then 1-2 years back, maybe 3, blue, purple, and very rarely pink started showing up again in the US, but oddly, most often sold as raw.",You can still order fentalogues online. I'm assuming people have it shipped to them then they dye it themselves. I can't really say for sure though.
5037,You can still order fentalogues online. I'm assuming people have it shipped to them then they dye it themselves. I can't really say for sure though.,"Yes, I tried to Google information about the dying and got shit.  I figured if the cartel was doing it there would be a news story somewhere."
5038,"I’m guessing this has been happening for a minute?  I’ve seen blue, purple, and pink for a minute now and was under the impression that the pink, U-47700, was to at least some degree pink of its own accord.  I mean, U-47700 was actually called “pink” and I probably first saw that crop up 5-6 years ago.  Purple and blue have been the last 1-2 years maybe.  Just never saw yellow and shit had REALLY weird effects and apparently dropped me for about 9 hours.","Pink was a pop singer, hun"
5039,"Pink was a pop singer, hun","...and a terrible one at that, but look up that shit up, I’d guarantee there are some pictures of the crap as it was sold online until 3-4 years ago I think.  Again, I have a junkies concept of time, I just know roughly the timelines by where I was at the time."
5040,Neon Yellow Heroin?,That stuff almost always made me manic when I'd shoot it. Strong shit though that's for sure

5043,How long were you on the tramadol?,"I only took it three times, each time about a week apart."
5044,"I only took it three times, each time about a week apart.",Your not experiencing physical withdrawals.
5045,"Just relapsed, any help with WD’s?",Benadryl to sleep will help. Also this guide is important to remember/reference. It's the [Opiate Withdrawal Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3hjbe7/the_definitive_withdrawal_survival_guide/) made for this subreddit.
5046,Is a cold the perfect time to go thru withdrawals?,"I feel like you answered you own question throughly in your post. If you're numb through all of it, then hell why not do it? If you're trying to quit anyway, sounds like the perfect time to me."

5048,Is a cold the perfect time to go thru withdrawals?,Heroin is like super vitamin c for you immune system. With how poorly I took care of myself while my immune system should have been useless but I never caught anything. Or maybe I did and was didn't notice cause I was dopesick

5051,Is a cold the perfect time to go thru withdrawals?,"I’ve detoxed a couple times when I was already sick. I tend to be the same as you, in that I kinda just resign myself to feeling bad and don’t really fight it when I have the flu or something... and I figure if I’m already feeling terrible, why not?"
5052,Is a cold the perfect time to go thru withdrawals?,"By the sounds of it, you're ready to get clean. You're in the right mind-frame for it. I made the decision to get clean one night - that was it. I had run out of drugs and money and that was that.  It was by far the easiest withdrawal I've had because I was convinced I could do it. That alone made all the difference for me. I did it CT with just benadryl and Lyrica for the first two days (it was the weekend) then, I made an appointment with my psych Monday and got some other things like clonidine, valium, and librium.

Do it and check back in with us. I would love to hear about/see your progress."
