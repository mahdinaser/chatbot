They say it's the \"law\" that they can't fill it until the \"day of\" when you are completely out of your medication, but it's not the \"law\"...it's their store policy.  Importantly, it can also vary depending on what type of insurance you have as well.  My first piece of advice to you is if you decide to switch pharmacies, MAKE SURE you let your pain management office know this, as you likely signed some sort of pain contract stating that you will only use one pharmacy to fill your prescriptions at.  So if you change, make sure you let them know before you leave the office...it shouldn't be a big deal, just let them know that you've had bad experiences with Publix and you want to try Walgreens because it is closer to your house or whatever reason you want to give them. The biggest mistake you can make is not telling them.I too am prescribed meds for my chronic pain (oxycodone) and my Doctor, as well as pharmacy (Walgreens) allow me to fill 1-2 days early, specifically so I don't wake up the \"day of\" without any medication and have to wait for the pharmacy to open before I get any pain relief, not to mention starting to feel sick, as I usually take my first dose right at 5:00AM when I wake up...so waiting 4 hours or so for the pharmacy to open, having to leave work, in pain, starting to feel sick, is just borderline stupid.  I get that if you pick up your prescription 2 days early every month that you aquire meds by the end of the year, but picking it up 1 day early is a huge convenience so you don't have to wake up in pain the morning of. If they try to tell you it is federal or state law, they are more than likely full of shit. I don't know every state law, but I'm aware of my state law, as well as federal law governing this...it often comes down to that pharmacy's \"policies\" and what your insurance provider allows.

It has a downside of not working forever since you'll become tolerant to it, but it can come in clutch once every few days. I find Benadryl sleep to be very refreshing.\n\nIf you can find some in the streets, Xanax is also nice once in a full moon if you can't sleep. I would recommend it last though since it is its own addictive substance unlike the other recommendations and also causes insomnia during withdrawal.\n\nAs for something you can research, look at medical journals weighing the benefit of things like l-theanine and other supplements on opiate withdrawal / depression / anxiety / whatever you're struggling with.

Not sure if you\u2019d call me an addict at this point but my use went from chipping a couple days at a time for years to now going on 1-2 week long binges. Everything changed when I got my own script of K56\u2019s this May.", "3846": "Like these folks replying to your comment touched on, opiates initially helped energize me and keep me high-functioning during college... but every week that passed by I was using a little more frequently, rationalizing just one more dose for the day... By the time I finally got into medical school, more hours of every day were occupied with thoughts of just staying home and using... The way you rationalize is crazy. I used my fear of failure to tell myself I deserved some respite from the pain.. even though the only one inflicting pain on me was myself. \n\nI knew that this career path I'd worked so hard for years for was really just a thin tightrope I walked between being a dope-head on the corner and being an upstanding citizen that people look to with respect. I clung to it like a life-raft. My first semester of medical school, I would show up at my Suboxone appointments dressed all professionally like I'd just left class or clinic. I was just putting on a facade to help myself feel like I was somehow different from these other junkies that were coming in... But I knew it was a facade. I knew I was no better. It came to a point where that line became so thin, that I knew if I didn't reach out for help, I was going to succumb to this sickness and die. \n\nMy doctor who was managing my Suboxone during my first year of medical school agreed to have him and his team come with me to talk to the faculty at my school and set up a plan for a leave of absence. If it weren't for the overwhelming understanding of my school and their facilitating a medical leave from school after first semester, my crash and burn story would've rivaled the Titanic. They really showed pure faith in me and my ability to find my way back to myself, and that's what drove me to an iron fucking conviction that I was going to kick this shit once and for all. \n\nI moved home to be with my parents for 6 months. I did a very steep taper over 10 days (was on 16 mg/day) and went through about 6 straight weeks of a withdrawal depressive state I wouldn't wish on any human being. There was no color in the world. I was constantly in pain. The voice in my head kept telling me I would fail because I was, by fundamental nature, nothing more than a worthless addict. The hours dragged on every day, and every morning I woke up feeling no better. My inner voice taunted me, telling me I was clinging to a career as a physician like a life-raft that would deliver me from having to face that I really was, all along, destined to wind up spending my days hustling up as much money as I could for a hit and that real fulfillment would never be mine.\n\nMy loved ones helped me through that. But there were so many days, 2, 3, 4, months since my last dose.. that I wouldn't like how I felt or I couldn't handle the intensity of all my emotional faculties returning to me like this.. feelings I hadn't felt since I was young. But when the fog lifts, you see all the selfish destruction you've caused to the people who love you and the guilt just eats away at you.\n\nBut I pushed through every fucking day, looking myself in the mirror and reaffirming my choice to find myself again. Here I am, almost 7 months out and... very slowly, mind you... but more days than not now I'm able to feel happiness in a way that I never was able to on opiates. Like a poster above said, sobriety will give you what opiates promised to give you in its warm but deceitful embrace as it leeches everything good out of you. Now, when I'm working rounds in the hospital and I see a pediatric cancer patient's scans come back showing remission or a parent looks me in my eyes and thanks me.. I can viscerally feel the emotion, the fulfillment of knowing I'm on the right path to fulfilling my purpose. And as many days as I come home to my empty apartment and want to pity myself or engage my frustrations that I'm still this far out and having to put in daily, conscious work on changing my psychology.... I'm finally at the point where nothing in this fucking world would make me trade my life as it is now, even if hope and joy and purpose only show themselves fleetingly for now... for a life that's 100% the best opiate high obtainable. 5 minutes of Meaning > 20 years of floating opioid narcosis. \n\nThanks so much to all the friends that have commented here with great advice and encouraging words. I will be the best fucking physician I can possibly be and I hope to be able to help people like you all and your families with the perspective I've gained from being in that dark, hopeless prison of addiction... and forging my way out. Those who have experienced the deepest pain are the ones most capable of appreciating the beautiful joys life has to offer. I am sober, I am becoming the man I was intended to be, and I will continue busting my ass to be able to offer a hand down into the dungeon to pull people up and see the light that will illuminate their souls. \n\nTo becoming who we truly are", "3847": "Why would he need some pharmaceutical for re entry into the world?

It can be pretty funny too, there are often quite a few characters.\n\nAlso, if you're not a person who is much into all the God talk, it can get moderately annoying. But! If you're as good at mind-gaming yourself as a lot of addicts are, you can just set up an automatic translation in your head to \"higher power.\" And if higher power seems ridiculus at this point just look around at the group that you are in and know that, collectively y'all have more information and ability than just one of ya.

That is really long.\n\nI guess all I'm trying to get out is that the clinic my friend goes to will let you slide on payment on a regular basis so long as they know when they will get paid and you never stiff them. It also gives up to a month of take homes after 5 yrs i think, you get 2 after 5 months and it goes up from there. Plus it's way way cheaper most of the time.

And them just take half a sub a day? Oh you got nearly the same problem with mdone like me. The nearest clinic is about a hour drive away and for me the problem is too that you need to be about a decade into addiction that a clinic takes you. Plus often you nees other health pronlems that your insurancw covers it. I live in European country where everyone needs a insurance. Plua I wouls lose my driving license and then I couldnt can go to the clinic. A normal doctor isnt allowed to prescribe subs. Which is super stupid cause if you live like me in a rural area it would make sense. And if you want to be a mdone/sub clinic then you need to make extra courses etc and can easily lose your license as doc if some stupid mfucker sells his take homes. Like how should a doctor know if any asshole sells them. Olus the first 3 month you have to go there every day. Before you are allowed to get take homes. Our new drug politician will change that but hasnt dome anything yet in the first half year now. They are all stupid. Ppl who know nothing about drugs will be elected to drug politicians. Then they talk about how much thes will chamge and then happens nothing. Its like that for the last 4 years. The one before said the best comment in an interview. \"Interviewer: Why is alcohol legal? It kills 100 times more ppl than illegal drugs? Politician: Cauae alcohol is legal!!\" Like wtf girl? Whats wrong in your head. Why do you do that job if you know nothing about drugs. She also thought that smoking weed ince will lead you directly to an H addict. What a stupid cunt. I am really looking forward to the new girl and which intelligence she will have... normal Doctors are allowed to give out mdone for cancer patients, but noz for substitution. And also .4mg subs for cancer and if you get mdone/subs you will get an extra licwnae to drive cause addiction is in their eyes no sickness. Its a choice. Yes in some way it really is a choice but at some point you really need help but cant get it. Sorry for the rant but these old bastards making me so sick. I think these old bastards should be addicted just for one week and them they would change a lot. And after one week of addiction they should be dopesick for two weeks straight with the worst symptoms you could have. Such mfucker. Man I am sorry for the rant but I could be happily on mdone and have a great career again but I am stuck in this shit currently cause no one is willing to help me. But I found a great programm now, since I got PTSD and major depression and am bipolar I could go on a few weeks programm for that and they oftwn got ppl with addiction problems (I think its some sort of rehab but not listed as rehab so you wouldnt get treaten everywhere like a junkie) \n\nOne more thing I was in hospital and laid in coma for 4 days, and stayed 3 more days on a extra watching station, onw night on a normal station amd then after lunch the doctors came and told me that I had to go home cause my lunga, heart and kidneys are ok again plus my brain preasure is ok too. I was in hospital 7 days and when they found me at home I was dead. I had no pulse and was not breathing and all that piece of ahit doctor said was\" Better stop doing drugs think of kurt cobain etc. all of them died young because of drugs. \" When I came there I had no drugs in my system. Such mofos. And the old man in my room who got a bit of a pain in his left lwg was already there for 5 weeks. And got 150mg morphine, 70mg oxy and 40mg mdone. I said to him that I got pain too and he gave me his mdone the 2 days I was there cause he didnt liked it and gavw it back every time. Also he gave me once 20mg of oxy. That was a great day. \n\nCause back in 2005 his son was a H addict too and wantes to get off but couldnt get into the mdone programm so he (his dad) went out everyday to pick up mdone for his son so his son could get a job etc. His dad has done this 4 years now his son is completly clean has a wife and 2 kids plus his own construction company. The old man is for me a hero. He helped his son, paid everything and now his son does everything for him. Thats a real man and a real dad. Hw said everyone deserves a second chance and if his son struggles again hw would do the same again. Hw also gave me 1/4 of his fent patch for later at home. I thank him so oftwn and he said I dont have to thank him. He just helps the ones who are good but sont get the help they need. I hope they coule locate his pain and that he can walk normal now again.", "3743": "Yeah it's always got $$$ and no plugs or lots of plugs and no $$$", "3744": "You could use some benadryl instead, then. \nIt should be a lot cheaper than suboxone.", "3745": "What about those payday loans places?

Using buprenorphine as a maintenance drug can seriously help get and keep one clean.\n\nMany use the whole \u2018don\u2019t trade one addiction for another\u2019 but I think that it\u2019s a useless cliche (and at worst, harmful in this context. I understand that fear of dependence on something, but there is a huge difference in physical dependence and addiction, the latter of which encompasses an array of negative social, behavioral, and health outcomes.\n\nWhy not give yourself a year of maintenance? Or two years? and then taper down or off, which is always an option.  It\u2019s a long taper with bupe, but it can be done comfortably. It\u2019s a bit more difficult to taper with methadone due to how it is typically dispensed at clinics. \n\nAnother advantage of buprenorphine is its opioid-blockade effect. It helped me because when I craved hard, I knew it would be useless to use as I\u2019d feel nothing unless I waited a day or however long for it to wear off, which gave me time to get through the cravings and take my bupe the next day.\n\nMaintenance won\u2019t solve all your problems, but it\u2019s a useful tool that gives you time to address the other issues in your life that keep leading you back to addiction. Think about that... If at all possible, see a counselor or psychologist that specializes in addiction. I know most people hate the idea of it (I did) but it helped me identify and deal with my negative thought processes and helped me find ways to change my own behaviors that I never would have seen on my own.\n\nI have two years clean now, which is far longer than I\u2019ve ever been clean since I was 17.

The issue is the earth temperature warming so fast in such a short period of time does not give species time to adapt. Including humans and human civilization. Especially human civilization. \n\nMass migration will be a huge issue over the next 50-100 years, this isnt an issue affecting us so much as it is affecting our children's children and child children, etc. None of us will be alive when mass crop failures cause famine, when loss of biodiversity means catastrophic ecological damage, or when large population centers become uninhabitable because of rising sea tides.\n\nIt's alarmist to say global warming is going to destroy humans in the next 10 years, but its absolutely accurate say if climate change isnt addressed, humanity is going to experience catastrophe and untold devastation over the next 50-100 years to the point where everyday human life for billions of humans is exponentially worse than now.\n\nI'd point out disease is also increasing too, the warming climate means we're already seeing global warming associated disease like zoological vectors inhabiting areas they historically haven't. We're also seeing waves of chronic kidney failure in young males in areas most affected by the warming due to the increased prevalence of chronic dehydration from the increased temps.\n\nEvery major scientific discipline agrees this is a huge obstacle for humanity over the next century plus. We as a society should probably listen to the same scientists that brought us modeld that lead to smart phones and recombinant antibody therapy and space shuttles and they very internet and computer tech we are using to communicate now. \n\nAnyone who argues global warming doesn't matter has been poisoned by non scientists trying to push a political agenda catering to the agenda of billions of dollars in fossil fuel interests.\n\nThe xkcd pretty deftly shows how ridiculous the effects of small global temperature changes are on the earth.

Read some actual scientific reviews of climate change and try to see if you can at least understand the actual scientific contentions: i.e. humans have released large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over the past century due to industrialization --> due to the greenhouse effect co2 reflects infrared radiation back to the earth and insulates the planet creating warning proportionate to the amount of green gases released --> the planet warms rapidly far outside of normal geological warming and cooling periods which should take 1000s of years to occur --> the sudden increase in global average temperature alters the biosphere in ways that is negatively determinal to humans --> famine, drought, extreme hea t and weather, ocean acidification, increased disease burden from climate change, etc. \n\nI know it seems like stupid liberal propaganda, but the majority of money against climate change comes from the fossil fuel industry which has billions invested in mainting short term profits at the expense of our grandkids and their kids future.

If you need to you can do the same with a 3rd dose. \n\nDay 2:  \n     * Take 0.5mg of bupe. Wait 30 minutes and use your dope. Use a normal amount of dope. \n\n     *Take 0.5 mg of bupe. Wait 30 minutes and take 20% less than your normal dose of dope. \n\n     *May repeat for a 3rd dose of needed. \n\n      * The first dose of this day you might feel slightly diminished results from your dope. By the last dose of this day...you may not feel too much from your dope. This is a good sign that your receptors are becoming saturated with buprenorphone. This is the goal for induction and is a sign that you are safe to continue and stop your dope very soon. \n\nDay 3:\n     *. Take 0.5mg of bupe. 30 minutes later take 20% less than your decreased amount of dope from the day before . \n\n     * 2nd dose take 0.5mg of bupe and 30 minutes later take the same amount of dope as your first dose of the day. \n\n     * 3rd dose...if you have not been experiencing withdrawal symptoms...take 0.75mg of bupe and same dose of dope as before. \n\nDay 4:\n     * Take 0.75mg of bupe and 30 minutes later take 1/4-1/2 of your original, pre-induction amount of dope. \n\n     *Take 1mg of bupe and the same amount of dope from dose 1 of this day. \n\nDay 5:\n     *Take 1mg of bupe. See if you have any worsening symptoms in this time.  If you do NOT don\u2019t take any more dope.  If you do rinse and repeat from the day before and attempt this step on day 6. \n\n     *have dope on hand if needed...but I have never needed it. If no w/d symptoms (nothing worse than what you felt when you woke up....which I never felt any other than some fatigue) flush the rest of your dope or donate it to the needy...I am sure you could get ample addressed on here to mail it to if needed!!  JK of course. \n\n     *I have done this whole process successfully in as few as 2 days...but would err on the side of caution the first time you do it just because we all metabolize and respond differently to medications and such. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have to take any dope you are ready to find your comfortable dose of bupe:\n     * If you need to you can repeat the 1mg at 12 hours after the first dose on the last day (the day you don\u2019t take any dope). I have found that 2mg is usually plenty and makes it easier to do a quick taper if that is your plan...and either way easier to get off of even if you plan to do maintenance. \n\n     * With some of the insane fentanyl analogies you may need a higher dose of buprenorphone, and in that case you can dose every hour (after repeating in 12 hours from the first bupe only dose) until you get to a tolerable level or lack of symptoms.   This titration is to be done at the end of the process once you are off your dope and only taking subs. \n\nBest of luck to you fam!!  \nBlessings!!\n\nEdit:  formatting.", "2860": "if you're doing fetty, this method wont work.", "2861": "If I am understanding what you are saying, you are not describing the Bernese Method.

My natural tolerance has always been through the roof, and of course it just got higher and higher.  I would take an insanely huge dose and hope that it would either get me as high as the first few times, or just kill me, and even then still get neither.\n\nIt makes me think of how Kurt Cobain died, I imagine he felt the same way.  Took an insanely high dose of heroin and then didn\u2019t get really high and didn\u2019t die either, and it happened so much that one day after being so disappointed again he finally shot himself after the dose.\n\n\nWay before I got to this stage in my addiction I had a \u201cI\u2019ll just get super high one last time and be done and quit, get at least as high as the first time.\u201d  It was similar to the first feeling I described, but towards the end there was no delusion I would quit.

Keep in mind that September 12th of this year, a little more than a week ago was exactly 10 months that I\u2019ve been into my recovery from Heroin, and I am on Zubsolv for maintenance. \n\nWhile we were at her house and we were smoking bud and she was doing shots and I would shoot her for her, I had picked up a bag of her dope just to see how decent it was, and it actually was brown, which is rare around here, NW suburbs of a very large, midwestern city. \n\nAnyways/ long story short, every time that I hit her, about 13 or so times total in the 2 or 3 days that I had shot her up, I hit each time and didn\u2019t miss a drop. \n\nAnyways, on a certain day of last week, a day or two after she had shot up herself and then I came over and did it for her, she developed an abscess due to her not knowing what the fuck she was doing, and her going in the same spot thinking that was okay. She has *very little* knowledge of harm reduction other than \u201cwash your hands, only reuse a needle 3, 5 times at the most, don\u2019t do too large of shots and always do a tester shot\u201d, etc., but still, she\u2019s an idiot and continued shooting herself up *knowing that she was missing just because she did not want to snort it*. \n\nSo in conclusion, no, I do not want to relapse. But I DO KNOW that if I had not and have not been on Zubsolv every day since November 12th of 2018 I would be dead right now. I made the decision then to stop, but my Zubsolv has been a MAJOR crutch for me in my recovery; and although I fucking hate it sometimes, I can say that there is a good possibility that I would have relapsed and been right back to where I was 10 months ago had I not been on it since I\u2019ve been in my recovery from H.  \nNot to mention when I picked up the bag at my friends house I smelled it, and I smelled that vinegary smell and for some reason it smelled good to me rather than bad like I thought it would, and I say it like that because I\u2019ve never been face to face with heroin in these past 10 1/2 months. Point being, no, I don\u2019t want to go back to stealing/ pawning EVERYTHING valuable of my mother\u2019s, even though she\u2019s my best friend in the entire world? \n\nWhy would I go back to making my mother cry and having her tell me she fucking hates me after I stole money from her again. \n\nWhy would I go back to being depressed for 3 years straight, my entire Heroin career? \n\nNah\u2014 I thank God and myself that I\u2019m at the point where when I think about using again, I *ONLY* think of the negatives \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffb", "2630": "I just snorted 8mg suboxone.

In my experience subs do better for people whose addictions are a few months, a year or two long but methadone does best for those who\u2019ve been hooked for years in end. Our brains physically change after being exposed to opiates for a prolonged period of time and they will never go back to normal. The kind of thoughts you\u2019re currently having were crippling for me.  Unfortunately we will never just magically stop having these urges and cravings.

The price of things really was surprising  to me and I was there.  A new car was $10,000 same car now 25,000.  It is definitely harder to get by monetarily and everything is so stressful. They should offer massage at work before you leave to drive home and hand you a cup of coffee or wine and cheese.   I am taking my one ambien and saying my best advice is find another support outside the family that you can sit with or skype with  then make a plan and take your time because there will setbacks.

Just so happen to be \"treatment resistant\" to the point they're recommending ketamine therapy & all kinds of crazy shit so I'd rather stick with what I know works:  low doses of opiates & stims.\n\nI also realize I'm the exception rather than the rule.  The opioid crisis is very real & no one is immune.  Some of our best & brightest have died (Prince, Tom Petty & countless others with less fame/notoriety).  Everyone thinks they can manage it without ruining their lives.  I'm constantly vigilant & weigh the risks vs. benefits DAILY.  \n\nUnless you have a severe, disabling physical or mental condition that can't be better managed with other treatments, opioid use is not the best option.  And with mental illness mgmt it should be a last stop before suicide IMO.  The risks are simply too high for most people.  Exhaust every other option first.  Don't write off talk therapy with a professional.  It can be life-changing.  I go to a state-funded sliding scale clinic & use telemedicine where I don't even have to go anywhere for my appointments.

Once you start banging you very VERY rarely go back. \n\nBut yes you can shoot up and not make consistent track marks. But it takes disciple and skill to be honest. Some people are just better at shooting up than others. The key for me has been understanding how fast scar tissue develops and giving the needle marks time to go away/heal. \"A needle mark is a needle mark\"\n\nFor me it took time and the process sucked and was humiliating. Just like most people I started shooting in the crooks of my arms and when you go on a bender you shoot up multiple times in the same spot, re use needles, and if your starting off you just generally fuck your shit up with misses and improper technique. I definitely had track marks at first and I've had ones lasting months that have eventually gone away. \n\nBut eventually through trial and error most dope heads with any bit of finesse figure out how to reduce/avoid the tracks. But, you can't shoot up every day multiple times a day and not expect track marks. I don't know the \"least amount\" you can shoot up. But, for a couple years off and on I've been doing heroin and when I do heroin I bang it cause why the fuck would I do it any other way? I've done it before and it's arguably the best way to do it. And I usually can keep it to every weekend or every other weekend, friday-sunday/monday. I shoot up 2/3 times in a day max. I use 31 gauge needles and use a new clean every shot. I basically just use my left forearm cause I got a big juicy vein running all the way up/down it. The thing is, a needle mark, is a needle mark.. 31 gauge makes the smallest mark and usually goes away within like a few days I wanna say.. But the marks I make are small as fuck and no one really notices, I know this because I'm around people who are clean but used to use needles, they know their shit.\n\nBut yeah, don't do drugs kids!

When I'm using I shoot up between 4-8 times a day. There are dotted lines going up and down my arms and biceps. Within 8 days of stopping I'm back to wearing a T-shirt around my family. \n\n\nIf you start shooting you'll end up with a favorite spot. Its inevitable that you'll find a place that's easy for you to hit and that you can register consistently. Save this spot for emergencies after you find it. Otherwise, even when the tracks fade, you'll end up with a lot of scar tissue around that area and it'll start to suck to use and the tracks will stand out more and more in that area.\n\n\nBe safe", "1951": "It is possible, but the problem is the easiest veins are the noticeable one.

Opiates can also cause health issues depending on your drug and ROA, vein damage, abscesses, etc. You're also more likely to die from accidental overdose from opiates, especially if buying pills or dope on the street.\n\nSo both have terrible downsides. I think the biggest difference to me is what many opiate addicts (not all) do to get their drugs. Of course there's homeless alcoholics spending their only change on booze, or an alcoholic loses their job due to drinking and goes to the liquor store everyday, but it typically doesn't financially destroy you and it's legal. With dope/street pills being illegal and relatively expensive, you get more opiate addicts inevitably getting arrested, having expensive court costs, not working due to felonies (or needing to spend all day getting money/drugs), completely ruining themselves financially, stealing, prostituting, etc. I think more crimes are committed in the pursuit of opiates.\n\nSo I think opiate addiction is sometimes worse because I've seen it fuck more people's lives up in a HUGE way.

Many end up not even paying their bills, getting payday loans, shoplifting, stealing, scamming, pawning shit, prostituting etc.\n\nObviously both are horrible and can ruin your life, I just disagree that opiates have more \"inward\" consequences than outward.

She probably isn't getting around the clock pain control even with the building effect.\n\nThe tramadol isn't all that great for pain and it has super strong hyperanalgesia effects, after 3 years she may feel like she's in crisis level pain all the time because her brain is so dependent. I know I did and I was taking the highest recommended dose at the time 400 mg per day. \n\nWould she be willing to discuss a taper plan with her doctor to get her off the tramadol and onto a break through med she could actually benefit from?

Obviously no one wants to be narcaned or narcan a friend, but given the nature of opioid overdose there is a chance of brain damage, so better safe than sorry I say. If you genuinely can't rouse them or get any kind of response and their breathing is very slow or irregular, stopping and starting, then they're in danger and need medical attention.\n\nAlso, I was told it is safe to administer naloxone to anyone experiencing these symptoms, so if you see someone on the street unresponsive and with shallow or irregular breathing and pinned pupils then it's safe to administer naloxone (for them, not necessarily you, be safe!).

One example they used was some isolated nordic country where real heroin was almost non-existant, so junkies had moved on to IVing buprenorphine pills meant for pain since it was all they could get.

Heroin is cheaper and way easier to source.\n\nAs to why the underworld produces heroin instead of another opioid is because heroin is semi-synthetic, opium is taken from the poppy, morphine is isolated from the opium, and the morphine is converted to diacetyl (heroin) without the need for an advanced lab set up and chemicals, its the most potent easiest thing to make from the poppy besides if they just stopped at morphine (but converting to heroin makes it far more potent and a more desirable high).\n\nAs", "1239": "I personally think its portrayed as the king of opioids because:\n\n* It gives a good rush through all ROA's especially IV.

The only side effect I get is water/urinary retention and mild constipation. I also have to be careful not to overdo physical exercise, since its basically doping, so I feel it the next day if I do too much.\n\nHonestly, without Bupe, I would no doubt be on permanent disability and my quality of life would be significantly worse.

But it is important to look at it objectively and not take it personally... it says far more about them than us.\n\nFirstly they hold disgusting, shameful opinions, dehumanizing people with addiction is dehumanizing an enormous chunk of humanity, because many people will have a struggle with addiction at some point, odds are they even know someone who has or has previously been affected by addiction. Dehumanization is the gateway abhorrent human evil, people dehumanize others before they do things like lynching black people, gassing Jewish people, so... yeah...\n\nSecond I'm going say they are weak, weak willed, weak arguments, weak everything. They have been totally conditioned by anti-drug propaganda (weak critical thinking skills), they are filled with hate, due to ignorance, they can't form a valid argument (their cognitive minds are weak).\n\nThird. They lack moral fortitude, integrity, basic decency etc. So, when you guys are disagreeing on the cutest age range of kittens, they *creep* into your history and try to hurt you with something from your life that they know many people find painful.\n\nFourth, they're dumb. Tending not to be bright people at all - based on my experience that's a noticeable trait and not a just a baseless insult. I genuinely believe they have a below average intelligence, but also very sub-normal emotional intelligence.\n\nI could go on and on, but it is common, it is sad, humanity can cause many a sigh, many a rolled eyeball, but I'd trade a heroin addiction that I can overcome than being stuck as somebody that stupid, disgusting, creepy, that mean spirited and soulless. They cannot be happy people, it grosses me out thinking about them.\n\nI've even had my sister, who falls very much into the weak minded camp, use my drug use against me to 'win' an argument or add weight to her child-like attempts to get her own way on family issues. I opened up about my drug use a couple of years ago and I had a LOT of really nasty discrimination from people close to me, but it strengthened my good relationships too..

That first time, I was aiming for around 250 ug or so, although after a few days, it was closer to maybe twice that.  For addicts, the lethal dose is probably in the 5 to 10 mg range, so there's an even larger cushion.

Good luck\" ? \n\nWould you just shrug your shoulders and go home with no meds and be fine with nothing or maybe spend weeks trying to get into another cpp doctor, only to get in and he says hell give you tramadol or 3- 5mg hydrocodone per day?

What was your experience", "comments": [{"553": "I used to donate plasma at OctaPpasma all the time, and it was usually a pleasant enough experience. The only thing that I didnt like was when they were busy and I had to wait forever till it was my turn, because the actual process took about an hour too. \n\nThey dont drug test you, but you do get a little physical when you first sign up. The first time you donate they send your blood to a lab to test for HIV and a few other things. They also check your vitals everytime and check your plasma levels before hand and if you're too low they tell you to come back the next day. Some people like to go to different places to try to get more money because they only let you donate 2 times a week. They do have you show your arms during the vital check every time and they look for track marks, so if you shoot and have marks they might turn you away. They have a little kiosk with a touch screen computer that you answer the same 20 something questions every time you go. They ask things like if you have been sick since the last visit, been out if the country, gotten a tattoo, paid for sex, live with someone that has HIV, hepatitis, things like that.\n\nThe process isnt too bad. I dont shoot up, but I dont really have a problem with the big ass needle they use. It just takes a while because they take your blood, it runs in a machine that separates the red cells from the plasma, then it sends your red cells back into your arm. It does this probably 5 or six times until the bottle is full of plasma, then there's a bag of saline that it pushes into your vein to kind of rehydrate your blood since they took all that plasma out. Like I said the process takes about an hour. Yoire sitting/laying in a comfy chair thing so you're comfortable. They have TVs and wifi. You're allowed to watch stuff and text on your phone, you just cant talk on your phone. \n\nThe money is decent too. At the place I went to you get $75 for your first donation. After that they have a system where you get $25 on your first visit of the week and $50 on your second. Plus they always have special promotions going on. It's either an extra $20 for your 2nd donation of the week. Or they base it on your total donations for the month and you can only do 8 a month since its max 2x a week. Like an extra $25 on your 6th, $30 on your 7th, and $50 on your 8th. Its Definitely worth it of you have nothing else to do and have spare time. You're also helping to save lives and create new medicines. \n\nUnfortunately they dont give you cash. They give you a prepaid debit card that you have to use and keep track of because they reload the same card everytime you donate. Once the guy in the back scans your plasma bottle the money gets put in your account. It was usually on there by 30 mins after I was done. The card isnt too bad because you can get cash back with it. I would go to publix and buy a soda then get the rest of the $ in cash back since you can pick exact amounts of cash back at publix. \n\nSorry for the book I just wrote. Lol.

I did. I said the same as you -- weed was anxiogenic and I wanted to relax.\n\nWell, as I got older and my addiction went on weed actually started to relieve the stress if my addiction to heroin. It became a great comfort during withdrawal, it allowed me to see my situation from the Birds eye view, and guess what??? From that perspective, a little dope sickness really AINT SHIT. And I can actually enjoy some goddamned music. Now, a lot of dope sickness (ie wd from a really big habit) really is shit, but it STILL isn't THAT bad, and it's still mostly just a bad flu if you keep the proper mentality (and a couple of subs, 10 Valium, and 20 400 mg gabapentin, along with the aforementioned cannabis doesn't hurt either).\n\nAnyways... Bottom line, I do smoke herb again although I tend to smoke less during the worst parts of my addiction. Just smoking a little herb after being abstinent from it for a couple weeks tends to rein my use in, which is always a good thing. N\n\nIt makes me think twice about my use. In a good way.\n\nNow, if I smoke TOO much, this self analysis can go too far and produce some anxiety or depression. But, that's just taking too much. Taking too much dope makes me, ya know, FUXKING DIE, so I just don't do that, and too much weed makes me anxious, so I just dont do that.", "5": "Used to be me, but now being on benzos, weed is super nice.
