0,How do you suggest tapering from .1 of Heroin down to nothing?,Lmao
1,Lmao,"It's actually possible to taper from .1 of H. I've done it before. If it was anything more than that (.2 max), then it would be another story. You got to be very mentally strong, OP"
2,"It's actually possible to taper from .1 of H. I've done it before. If it was anything more than that (.2 max), then it would be another story. You got to be very mentally strong, OP",Let's see if it works. If not i'll get some Kratom. That's my other option
3,Lmao,Why is there always some negative rat with nothing good to say.
4,Anyone have experience with both opana and h?,"Dude what’s the price of the opana for comparison? 

And my guess would be dope would go further always unless you get a really good deal."
5,Fast help with injecting heroin #3?,"I’ve heard lemon juice can have a bacteria in it that can cause an illness similar to cotton fever.  U can use powdered Gatorade or cool aid in a pinch too , it has a lot of citric acid"
6,Fast help with injecting heroin #3?,"Wow, you dont need any acid anything bud. Use warm water to break it down. (It will work, works on tar, and it will work on powder)"
7,"Wow, you dont need any acid anything bud. Use warm water to break it down. (It will work, works on tar, and it will work on powder)",Is it possible to make a nasal spray with water and the powder to lessen the harshness to the nasal passage?
8,"Wow, you dont need any acid anything bud. Use warm water to break it down. (It will work, works on tar, and it will work on powder)",for #3 you do.
9,"Wow, you dont need any acid anything bud. Use warm water to break it down. (It will work, works on tar, and it will work on powder)","Wow, your wrong. For #3 you need an acid."
10,"Wow, your wrong. For #3 you need an acid.",You've done it personally?
11,Fast help with injecting heroin #3?,"Do a quick search. I want to say vitamin c but it sounds fumny.

Yep! Vitamin c do quick search ""#3 vitamin c"""
12,Fast help with injecting heroin #3?,"You need to use citric acid or vit c (ascorbic acid - less harsh on ur veins). You can buy citric from many supermarkets or places that sell herbs and spices. It's popular in Indian dishes. I bought a 100g pack from my local store a few years ago - still got it!

Mix heroin, water and a little acid - heat to around boiling point, stir, filter and have fun!

You can use any acid. I've used vinegar once and lemon juice once too. Not a nice taste in ur mouth when injected, but does the job. Beware these though as they can grow bacteria if left to sit for hours/days. Inject immediately, don't come back to your spoon hours later..."
13,Fast help with injecting heroin #3?,citric acid..you can get it in powder form from your grocery..lemon juice or white vinegar works too

I do like that first “starting to kick in “ from both and are similar to a degree. Have fun!","Yes exactly the starting to kick in part is what I meant! Very similar! And thank you I will!

Just one problem I have with addy is since I discovered it, it’s completely ruined my love for opiates. I can’t enjoy opiates anymore. I went from taking oxy everyday for a couple years to just hating them. 

I’ve tried to enjoy them again but the last 3 times just left me disappointed. I think I need to put the addy down for a while because the euphoria is too great it overpowers everything else and makes it hard to get joy from other substances"

Because before I got into addies all I’d do was downers like norcos oxys and smoke weed, and I’d feel down. Nod off. I LOVED it. It made me feel amazing. I thought no high could top it. 


Then i try adderall and feel the same/ greater euphoria AND get shit done so you think “wow I feel euphoric and I am not lazy I’m getting important stuff done”  and you feel more creative and all that haha... so basically the total opposite of opiates


So now when I do oxys I nod off and feel like a worthless couch potato haha. It’s mental. I gotta put these addys down tho. It’s getting to be to where I depend on them to get shit done."

21,Fake algs?,In my experience those ALG imprints wear off very easily
22,Fake algs?,id be more worried if they arent scratched like that
23,Fake algs?,Yeah usually algs are soft and scratch easy this is actually a good way to tell if you have a real alg
24,Fake algs?,"Don't post a pic, we dont allow fake or real posts. The only way to really tell is by testing it. You can't tell off of just looking at it."
25,Subs?,If you have no tolerance it can make you feel pretty euphoric. It’s actually one of the first opiates I abused. I was only having to take half to 1mg and getting totally wrecked for hours and hours
26,If you have no tolerance it can make you feel pretty euphoric. It’s actually one of the first opiates I abused. I was only having to take half to 1mg and getting totally wrecked for hours and hours,I’ve got a pretty low tolerance. 20 mg of oxy and I’m nodding. Haven’t had anything since sat night.
27,I’ve got a pretty low tolerance. 20 mg of oxy and I’m nodding. Haven’t had anything since sat night.,I’d probably start with 2mg dissolved under the tongue
28,I’d probably start with 2mg dissolved under the tongue,I'd recommend taking even less than 2mg. If OP doesn't have tolerance to opiates 2mg could possibly get him/her completely wrecked and spend the rest of the day puking lol.
29,I'd recommend taking even less than 2mg. If OP doesn't have tolerance to opiates 2mg could possibly get him/her completely wrecked and spend the rest of the day puking lol.,Probably better advice than I gave.  I do remember that taking any small amount too much will leave you puking. I once gave a girl I was on a date with .5mg because she wanted to try some and she spent the rest of the night puking her guts out...   was not a great experience for her.

It just doesn't give that full bodied euphoria like other opiates because it's only a partial agonist.
31,Yea a lot of people don't actually realize that bupe is extremely strong. It just doesn't give that full bodied euphoria like other opiates because it's only a partial agonist.,47 times the affinity rate of morphine.  That really hits the shit out of the receptors.
32,47 times the affinity rate of morphine.  That really hits the shit out of the receptors.,Exactly and that's why there isn't very many opiates or opioids that can break through that other than fentanyl and other extremely powerful synthetic opioids as far as I know. I've broke through using heroin before but god damn I had to use an ungodly amount to get high. And I put myself at risk of an overdose doing so.
33,Subs?,U may get sick and puke everywhere if u have a really low tolerance.
34,U may get sick and puke everywhere if u have a really low tolerance.,Ah shit. I’ll shoot for a low amount
35,Subs?,"You can definitely catch a buzz from subs. I used to, but they also made me anxious. I’m a paranoid person though. START small! If you take a huge piece its very likely you will get sick and puke. Also google precipitated withdrawals if you have recently taken any opiates. OH yeah, another warning. They knocked me the fuck out. If i took a piece at 6pm then went to sleep at 11pm. I was dead asleep. Which is a good thing for me haha"
36,Subs?,I'd shoot for taking between. 5mg-1mg to start. You can always take more if it doesn't get you were you wanna be. I had a friend with no opiate tolerance that took 2mg of my sub one time and he said he ended up spending the next 12 hours puking his stomach out high as hell. Buprenorphine is only a partial agonist but it is actually extremely strong.

Buprenorphine is only a partial agonist but it is actually extremely strong.,Took about 1 mg. Feeling a bit buzzed but wishing I didn’t. It’s not something I can do my usual working out and daily routine on. I actually feel a bit sickly.
38,Subs?,"When I was in jail (was clean at the time) 1mg of Subutex was enough to get me nice and high for the evening. We used to crush it up and snort it.

If you've not got a tolerance to opiates, 1mg or less will be plenty. It was a very popular commodity inside. One 8mg tablet would sell for £50.

Suboxone is the same. The naloxone in it does not make any practical difference in this case, afaik."
39,Subs?,"Subutex on its own is great, imo, not everyone likes it.

I tend to snort when I do have them.
Be careful though, the tiny pills hit hard AF.

A normal 8mg pill I usually crush and do in 3 tiny bumps, you'll feel it unless you're a full on opy-head then do it in 2.

Edit: never done subuxone, not sure what the NAX will make you feel like."
40,Subs?,Bro it is an opioid it’s just also has Naloxone and the buprenorphrine is just a partial agonist so you don’t really get like a euphoria u kinda do but not really but it will make you not sick and give you energy some pain relief ect... all that stuff u get from opiates besides the euphoria pretty much. And their meant to be taking sublingually  ppl say they’ve shot they up and and other things but that makes the Naloxone have 100% bioavailability so I don’t see how that would get you high it would get sick if anything in theory. On the other hand subutex is just buprenorphrine and I will snort those and I get feeling pretty fucking good

I have IVd subs numerous times during my years of using. The naloxone does absolutely nothing.
42,The bupe has a higher binding affinity than the naloxone in suboxone. I have IVd subs numerous times during my years of using. The naloxone does absolutely nothing.,Kool I didn’t know the bupe had higher binding affinity than Naloxone I knew it was higher than other opioids but not Naloxone. So if I rail my subs to get high bioavailability even the the nalaxone has higher it wouldn’t make me withdrawal
43,Kool I didn’t know the bupe had higher binding affinity than Naloxone I knew it was higher than other opioids but not Naloxone. So if I rail my subs to get high bioavailability even the the nalaxone has higher it wouldn’t make me withdrawal,Exactly. As long as you haven't used any other opiates obviously. But even in that case it is actually the bupe that causes the precipitated withdrawals and not the naloxone.
44,Exactly. As long as you haven't used any other opiates obviously. But even in that case it is actually the bupe that causes the precipitated withdrawals and not the naloxone.,Alright kool and yea I’ve been clean and on subs for about a month and a half now only other thing I take is kratom to stretch my subs and stock them up to take like 3-4 at once every once and awhile to kinda catch a buzz or nod if I take like a week off before taking 4 of them and when I do take kratom I give myself 24 hours on both sides of taking it to avoid paws because I known all to well about it lol
45,2mg dilaudid- like a perk 10?,"Hydromorphone has an extremely low bio availability when taken orally, make sure you snort it. Enjoy brother"

47,2mg dilaudid- like a perk 10?,"If you crushed up the 2mg dilaudid and snorted it, I believe the high would be equal to popping 15-20mg of Percocet. For me personally when I crushed up a 4mg and snorted the high was better then a 30mg oxycodone"
48,2mg dilaudid- like a perk 10?,"Dilaudid was always my favorite. For me it was just a much cleaner, blissful high than I got from any other opiate. No negative side effects at all. I don’t remember the dosages though, you’d have to check an equivalency chart."
49,2mg dilaudid- like a perk 10?,Different for everyone. I could take 9 dilaudd Ana prefer a 5 perc
50,Do you know what this is?,"GHB - the b is Butyrolactone, which itself is somewhat interchangeable with GHB 

A person could pretty easily acquire Bute. 

Butyrolactone, according to google:


“The effects of GHB/GBL are felt within 15 to 20 minutes and may last up to 3 or 4 hours depending on the strength of the substance and quantity consumed. The most common effects of G are: Feelings of euphoria. Increased libido.” 

Having some experience with GHB - the dosing has to be very precise, since the difference between a good time and passing out is like a matter of milliliters.

Maybe he was trying to help you guys relax, ha!, but he could equally have been trying to get you knocked out. 

Either way, he was attempting to drug you without your consent, which might be indicative of other things he’d be willing to do without your consent, and in this case, without you even being aware of what he was doing, since you’d be knocked out. 

Avoid this person.

Edit:

That being said, knowingly taking G can be lots of fun. Similar to alcohol but better - no hangover, and maybe some of the best sleep a person can get. Like most illicit drugs, quality and strength vary. Know your dealer. Go slow. Be safe."

Definitely someone to avoid"
52,"Thank you. That’s the name butyrol.... whatever .... 

Definitely someone to avoid","Also, if you weren’t aware, GHB is often what people mean when they talk about ‘the date rape’ drug (or rohypnol, which is a powerfully sedative benzodiazepine, like Xanax).

A bottle cap full of GHB is enough to knock just about anyone out, so it can be easily slipped into a drink. It has a kind of olive-soapy taste/liquid texture. So if your beer ever tastes like a dirty martini, get a new one."

I recently moved several hours away and went to a hospital not connected to my old hospital and they were still able to see all of my meds and most testing I had done.

107,Does tolerance ever completely reset?,"Nope! At least not for me. I took a year and a half off of H (I would smoke a half g a night 3-4 nights a week, crazy tolerance) and was stoked to score and get high for super cheap. The first day it was true, a lot less got me way higher. But within a few weeks, my tolerance shot back up to Where it was. So again, I gave up on my opiate habit until im in able to financially afford it"
108,Does tolerance ever completely reset?,I have been done with h for a few months but I tried some and I still need multiple points to feel it I think my tolerance is through the roof
109,I have been done with h for a few months but I tried some and I still need multiple points to feel it I think my tolerance is through the roof,ahh ok thanks. maybe ill just wait a few more weeks or even months then see.
110,Does tolerance ever completely reset?,"were you doing 90 mg daily?  90 mg to 15 mg is a pretty big drop but 3 months is a long time.. there should probably be enough of a tolerance drop to feel 15 mg.  it's been 4 hours since you posted this, have you noticed a difference within that time period?  it usually takes about 2 hours for it to peak for me.   everybody's different but the common rule of thumb is that tolerance drops about 10% every 3-5 days, so 3 months should be long enough for even heavy users to experience a significant drop in tolerance"
111,Does tolerance ever completely reset?,"then again, opiates can be weird like that sometimes.   there's been times where i would take a year or more off and barely feel the effects and there's times where i expect my tolerance to be raised drastically but get high off an amount lower than my latest dose"
112,Does tolerance ever completely reset?,"generally speaking though, yes tolerance does usually reset completely if given enough time.  that's a huge reason why a lot of relapses result in od's.  they usually try to do their usual amount without taking into account their lowered tolerance"
113,Does tolerance ever completely reset?,"Last time i went to a detox center i was easily doin about 3 - quarter gram shots(0.25 grams) per day and coulda handled a lil more per shot. Went to detox and got out on the 6th day, got a 0.1 bag and could barely handle 1/10th of the 20 bag.

So i went from easily doin .25 then 6 days later coulda oded on .02.

But just as it only took 6 days to get no tolerance, within 2-3 days it went right back up to doin .25 gram shots. This is all the same exact dope too, id been getting the same shit for 6 months"
114,Does tolerance ever completely reset?,"There are two types of receptors. One which makes you instantly high, and one with which the drug builds up over time. You can always get something out of a bag but it might not make you high if your receptors are busy or just used to being abused

Time will clear it almost completely, but not sure how much. Probably a very long time"

117,Smoking H with a bong?,"Will be a waste. Heroin is water soluble. You will lose dope in the bong water. I dunno how much or how wasteful, but I wouldn’t think it would be a good idea."
118,Smoking H with a bong?,You'll lose some by doing like that.. It's too fine of a powder.. Best using the ole foil and straw method
119,Smoking H with a bong?,"Smoking H off foil is actually “vaping”  as your not actually applying a flame directly to the H. To vaporize a substance, heat is applied but not to the point of the autoignition. It doesn’t really answer your question but people don’t really see smoking H with foil as vaping."
120,Smoking H with a bong?,"look at the hot knife and bottle method, basically you hot knife the H into a bottle with no bottom and a small hole for the knife. Once it's all vaporised you can suck at the top of the bottle and get all the H without wasting any.

Or you can build ""The Machine"" that's used to vaporise DMT without loss. Works for heroin as well but you'll need a heat gun"
121,Smoking H with a bong?,Do a dab instead or do a hot knife dab.
122,Smoking H with a bong?,"This sounds complicated. Why not just smoke off foil like normal folk? If you really want your shit to be water filtered, use a dab rig. I’ve heard of teenagers in my hometown that throw a booger on some weed and put that in a bong, but once again, why?"

Dab rig would be miles better but just working with what I own.
124,Smoking H with a bong?,"Actually, no this won’t work. 

When you smoke off foils, the flame is under the dope. Heat naturally travels upwards and only upwards from a flame. The only way to bring that heat downwards like when you use a bong is with air suction through the bowl/downstem. Even if you poked additional holes on the outermost later of foil to make this happen, you would be pulling the flame directly onto your dope which is not only wasteful, but provides for shitty smokes.

Be simple. Smoke off foil."

128,Sublocade From Private ($) Doctor?,"I've read everyone who's on the sublocade shots feels like they're in withdrawls for the first week and they CANNOT receive pills on top of it in my state, not sure about yours.

132,"Yep, I mean one point. At least that's how much I think it is.","There’s a lot of variables when it comes to H. One person might get some fire raw strong ass stuff and another might get some heavy fent cut stuff and another might get some shitty weak stuff and all of them will most likely cause different intensity of WD but I’d say go by the normal average of 3-5 days and the normal symptoms like restless legs, stomach and Bowel issues, fatigue, insomnia. Lethargy and the mental symptoms. Obviously get as many comfort meds as possible like Kratom, loperamide, ibuprofen/ Tylenol and for sleep if you can’t get ahold of benzos then melatonin definitely helps for me. I usually feel the worst on the first day and if I can plan right I try to time my first day with a day off from work. Try to find a good series on Netflix or something to help you zone out, keep your mind off of the WD  and pass the time. I know it may sound crazy but I’ve read studies of music helping because when you hear something you like it makes the brain release “ feel good” chemicals and in my opinion it definitely helps a bit. At least with motivation. I’ll listen to some music In the shower while getting ready for work and on the way to work and it does help a bit with my mood."

That's one of the best pieces of advice I ever give newbies so they can distinguish between real dope and a crushed up pill bc they can look similar and taste similar but there's definitely a distinct difference.

Long drug binges fuck your immune system, so you're likely just ill from an infection you picked up while using, and just never noticed until you were no longer number by the opioids."
190,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?","I have to be honest with you ok? I was on opiates for 9 yrs. 1 year shorter than you. I also had protracted withdrawals. The first 19 days were a nightmare... after day 35 I felt I could do it. But here's the thing, I was having hotflashes, temperature control issues, depression & anxiety for 2 YEARS after I quit. And you know what I learned about opiates? That I very, very likely think is your real problem? OPIATES SHUT DOWN YOUR HORMONES. Suboxone is proven in literature to cause hypogonadism but ANY opiate can do it. Long acting opiates simply do it quicker than shorter acting ones.

It took me about 2 yrs to realize I wasn't having protracted withdrawals but nearly shut down my endocrine system. Once I started addressing that... fast forward another 2 yrs & I feel completely different. Like a new person.

What's worse is when your hormones are low, you can't digest or absorb critical nutrients and problems can get worse if you're hyper focused on opiates rather than hormones.

The first thing I'd try is go out and get a bottle of pregnenolone. It's a hormone. You shouldn't take it everyday unless you see an endocrinologist and it's NOT going to magically fix you. But if it makes you feel a lot better... thats a good sign your hormones are screwed up. And to fix this long term you need higher levels of so many different things to get the endocrine system optimized again. Zinc, iron, iodine (for the thyroid which sends messages to release hormones), boron, magnesium, potassium, high doses of B-5 for the adrenals, B-1 for the heart, you really need a high dose B multi-vitamin every day stacked on top of a normal multi-vitamin... then top that off with amino acids that your stomach likely isn't converting.  The LNAAs are the hardest to convert but also the most important like l-tyrosine, phenylalanine, l-tryptophan, glycine is also great for relaxation, stress & sleep.

I GUARANTEE that after 10 yrs of using opiates you've dramatically reduces your hormone levels and have washed out so many critical minerals, vitamins that can take at least a year to get back to normal levels. You should be taking 10,000IUs of vitamin D every day with 100mcg K2, vitamin D is also a hormone & if you stripped that out of your body by not being in the sun for 10 yrs ... you're just stacking on years and years you're gonna have to wait before you really feel better.

I know this sounds like a lot of info and IT IS but when you get so use to craving opiates... that craving for opiates is likely about 20% a craving for opiates and 80% a craving for higher hormone levels. Iron deficiency all by itself is known to trigger extremely weird cravings for all sorts of things. If you haven't eaten lithium containing foods in 10 yrs... and your lithium is low... that will also make you crave opiates when really you have no lithium in your body which is stressing you out and making you crave things you don't actually need.

PLEASE take this seriously. Your body CAN NOT produce endorphins when your hormones are low. So you will be craving all sorts of shit your body does not need. It doesn't need opiates. It needs all that shit you spent 10 yrs stripping out of your body and could never feel because you had opiates in your system.

GOOD LUCK & please ask questions if you have any!"
191,"I have to be honest with you ok? I was on opiates for 9 yrs. 1 year shorter than you. I also had protracted withdrawals. The first 19 days were a nightmare... after day 35 I felt I could do it. But here's the thing, I was having hotflashes, temperature control issues, depression & anxiety for 2 YEARS after I quit. And you know what I learned about opiates? That I very, very likely think is your real problem? OPIATES SHUT DOWN YOUR HORMONES. Suboxone is proven in literature to cause hypogonadism but ANY opiate can do it. Long acting opiates simply do it quicker than shorter acting ones.

It took me about 2 yrs to realize I wasn't having protracted withdrawals but nearly shut down my endocrine system. Once I started addressing that... fast forward another 2 yrs & I feel completely different. Like a new person.

What's worse is when your hormones are low, you can't digest or absorb critical nutrients and problems can get worse if you're hyper focused on opiates rather than hormones.

The first thing I'd try is go out and get a bottle of pregnenolone. It's a hormone. You shouldn't take it everyday unless you see an endocrinologist and it's NOT going to magically fix you. But if it makes you feel a lot better... thats a good sign your hormones are screwed up. And to fix this long term you need higher levels of so many different things to get the endocrine system optimized again. Zinc, iron, iodine (for the thyroid which sends messages to release hormones), boron, magnesium, potassium, high doses of B-5 for the adrenals, B-1 for the heart, you really need a high dose B multi-vitamin every day stacked on top of a normal multi-vitamin... then top that off with amino acids that your stomach likely isn't converting.  The LNAAs are the hardest to convert but also the most important like l-tyrosine, phenylalanine, l-tryptophan, glycine is also great for relaxation, stress & sleep.

I GUARANTEE that after 10 yrs of using opiates you've dramatically reduces your hormone levels and have washed out so many critical minerals, vitamins that can take at least a year to get back to normal levels. You should be taking 10,000IUs of vitamin D every day with 100mcg K2, vitamin D is also a hormone & if you stripped that out of your body by not being in the sun for 10 yrs ... you're just stacking on years and years you're gonna have to wait before you really feel better.

GOOD LUCK & please ask questions if you have any!","Thank you SO MUCH dude you have no idea how much I appreciate informed advice like this.  I definitely recognize some of the symptoms you describe so this absolutely could be a factor, and I didn't even think of this kind of explanation.  I will go out and get the things you mentioned ASAP.  One immediate question: you mention lithium, do you recommend just switching diet to more lithium-containing foods, or should I try to get lithium by itself as a supplement?  I am absolutely going to follow your recommendations, and I understand it may take a bit to feel the effects of such a regimen, but would you mind - I've never tried to do this on reddit before - would you mind if I PMd you in a few days or weeks if I end up having questions or need more clarification?  If you're not a big reddit guy, I understand, but you're the first person - including 3 doctors - who has mentioned anything about this to me, and i can tell you're one of the many smart people who went through this shit with opiates, so I value advice from people like you 1000x more than some fucking LCPC or whatever who has never had a beer in their life and tells people to ""just tough it out"".  I swear to god I went to 3 different sessions with a psychiatrist, all she would prescribe me with was SSRIs and hydroxyzine.  It was 3 weeks of ""how are your meds working?"" followed by me saying ""not at all, they have absolutely no effect on my symptoms"", followed by them saying ""ok, let's up your dose by 50%, see you next week!""  And in this 1 comment you've given me more information and better advice than that MD did in 3 weeks.


Thanks again, you really have no idea how much I appreciate advice like this."

Another guy mentioned hormones, I never thought about others, but I went to test replacement. It helps with something.
Mind you, I can't imagine I've been using/quitting for 15 years if I wasn't already broken in the head/body.

Best I felt? First time I quit. Wasn't ten years, closer to 5. As another poster said, I went to clean eating, working out, and hard. Holy shit I was a different person.

So all read together:
1. make a health plan and force yourself to follow it. Food, excercise, sleep. Holistic health.
2. If you can get an endocrinologist involved, do it. Wanna do it bro science? Can get saliva testosterone tests online and there's lots of bro-science out there about how to level your hormones.
3. Consider replacement therapy. You've made it almost a month. Can you make it another month? That seems to be the big tipping point for long term users. If not, consider a clinic or a doc. May be able to do a low dose and taper. Or, maybe you stay on for life. Like an antidepressant. I know here, a regular gp can now prescribe sub. Try to shun the judgement you're already putting yourself through, and do what you need to.
4. Kratom works for some people. They sometimes sound like the ""just smoke pot!"" people but it's a trade: subs are come up in studies, kratom has lots of internet scientists behind it.

Those are not in any particular order.
Good luck friend. You've already done some of the hardest shit, in some way it gets easier, in some ways the long fight is the hardest. You're doing it though, that's huge."

Any advice?","I didn't read the comments so idk if you answered this but what were talking? If it had fent in it wds can be very unpredictable. There is so many different analogs and even with the same batch people seem to react very different to it. 

Ive had 2 times where I tried to get on subs from fentadope and it took awhile. The first time I went to a sub doc who knew I was still using and he said wait 24 to 48 hours then take the subs. I waited 6 days because I never went into wds. After that I thought they just were really mild and took 4mg of subs. I got thrown into the worst pwds ive ever had. I couldn't take it so I did a small line to get out and had to wait another 8 days to take them. The second time I made it 8 days with very little symptoms then went back to h.

My buddy was taking the same stuff and said he'd start feeling wds after 24hours. When i recently got back on subs i was getting raw and it only took a few days. 

Unfortunately with so many different mixes no one really knows what you are taking so exact answers are hard to find"
218,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?","Sometimes underlying conditions or infections pops up due to the stress of going through withdrawal, change in metabolism, what else... if it gets worse (fever, dehydration) or you feel deep emotional distress go and consult.
I had a friend die from underlying infections post wd. Take care."
219,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?"," Depending on the level and length of use, recovering heroin addicts are likely to suffer post-acute withdrawal symptoms (PAWS), including poor sleep, poor concentration, increased anxiety, depression, panic attacks, fatigue, hypersensitivity, irritability, mood swings, restlessness, and memory loss. PAWS can last anywhere from 18-24 months. The effects on mood and behavior can last months after other withdrawal symptoms pass. However, as time goes by and the user remains drug free, the symptoms will slowly begin to diminish.  - [Addictioncenter.com](https://Addictioncenter.com)

I was addicted to heroin for 10 years, I'll have 3 years clean on Halloween. My symptoms lasted for what seemed like an eternity, especially restless leg syndrome. I'm proud of you! Don't ever stop moving forward and don't let yourself get you down <3"
220,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?","Were you doing actual heroin? or the fentadope that seems to be everywhere? If it's the fent then I think this is normal. You need to start eating and hydrating, take some melatonin for sleep, if that doesn't work try getting your hands on some trazodone or seroquel. People don't understand how much nutrition and taking care of yourself plays a role in how shitty you feel during WDs. Kratom could definitely help as well."
221,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?","I've withdrawn from suboxone for close to 3 weeks before, everyone is different and PAWS is real. Just keep at it, build good habits and you'll be okay. I know it's hard but if you've made it this far, you basically got it."
222,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?","Why doesn't anyone ever put what they're detoxing from?? 

Heroin? Methadone? Morphine? Hydro?"
223,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?","Also, normal. People think its its mostly the same for everyone (7-14 days) but the truth is every body is different. Depending on how long you were using, how much, how often, weight, gender and so many other factors. 

Quiting after that long is a HUGE, huge shock to the body and mind. It takes a while to feel normal again. Tbh i never even got there before getting on methadone."
224,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?","Yes. I think I reached the start of week 3 and yeah the symptoms werent as brutal but fuck they were NOT letting up. I was ready to kill myself so I started taking bupe then got off of that.


EDIT: Seroquel if you can get some for sleep."
225,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?","What are you quitting man?

I used to be 80% on day 5, but now it takes me until day 8 to feel 80%  I was using for 15 years  and was basically better by day 10  but I was using DHC/oxy and not fentadope.

This fentadope can have long lasting analogues in it -  it apparently has 2 or 3 different analogues in it now.  1 short acting,  1 mid,  and the other very long lasting.  so the WD's last for ages - this is why people still get precipated WD's from sub after 3 days.  

For me I could take a sub 10 hours later after oxy  and be good.  (real Euro oxy)"
226,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?","I have been through this as well.  I was taking prescription oxy and MS Contin for over 20 yrs.  I had these prolonged symptoms.  This is PAWS... post acute withdrawal syndrome.  According to what I read, it CAN last up to 2 yrs.  For me, what has been most difficult has been extreme anxiety, absolute lack of energy, pain and insomnia.  There are some supplements that are recommended.  I didn’t use any due to lack of cash.  Look up opiate recovery on YouTube.  I found some useful stuff last year.  It has been 17 months for me, and I’m finally feeling more like myself.  Best of luck... one hour at a time."
227,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?",I say grab some kratom.
228,"23 days clean, and the WDs aren't getting better, they're getting worse. Anyone experienced this? Is this normal? Any advice?","Dude it’s all in your mind,...well maybe 80% in your mind,u just gotta make yourself get over that shit.You can do it brother.You don’t have a choice."

261,Jesus how many mg did you take?,Jesus I dont know. I can just go by what I was told. I know I had a ten pack. I was at a friends house and we we're all chilling watching a game (Heat I think) and i remember taking 2 (2mg). After that it was a blur. I was told we all went to the spot we got them at and i was FUCKED UP. My peoples were telling them not to sell me any more. But they were crack heads and you know how that went. Apparently I was bugging them to do so and swore i would not take any. I just wanted them ( ha ha) and they sold me another 10. I proceeded to pop 2 more in front of them. So 20 bars total. I assume i gave some out but when I came too I had none. But i did have money and what not with me (including a 30 which i started the night with) so I didn't get robbed or nobody tried to get me cause i was fucked up. So up to 40mg total (prob did not take that many) but realistically 20-30mg.

I ended up sleeping from Thursday night when I took it until really early Saturday morning, it was like just barely 27hours, but when I woke up I felt awful for the next 16 hours easily, like I got in a fucking car wreck or some shit, oversleeping isn’t awesome at all"

319,Does heroin cause loud incessant moaning?,My mom is on oxygen and when her cannula comes out and her oxygen goes down she starts moaning constantly.  So it might be respiratory depression which is common with opiates.  Try waking him up so he can start to breath normally.

I kept getting woken up, when high as a kite, singing, humming, and sometimes gargling for no fucking reason.  Not sure what causes it, but seems to be some weird fucked up fentalogue.  It’s easy to explain falling asleep places...sorta...harder when the cops wake you up on a park bench and your belting out a song at the top of your lungs.  Homeboys high."
323,Does heroin cause loud incessant moaning?,"Actually yeah, funny you ask. The other night I caught myself doing it when high, pretty loud. Weird, since it's new to me & I've been doing heroin a long time. Maybe it's caused by stress or something."

325,Does heroin cause loud incessant moaning?,Yeah it's really weird but sometimes I'll like fall out or black out if I get really high and as I'm coming to I'll catch myself doing this. I think it's fent causing it rather than h though cause I've been doing a lot of really strong fent lately.

329,Does heroin cause loud incessant moaning?,"Do you have narcan in the house?

When he does that, he is very close to overdose. 

If you should ever find him unconscious with low pulse/shallow breathing, and unable to wake him. Make a fist and rub your knuckles on his sternum/ribs. It is supposed to hurt. This should wake up a person who is not overdosing. 

In the event a sternum rub fails, and you are concerned he may be dying, narcan could be the difference between him having a scary story to tell or the coroner arriving."

332,Does heroin cause loud incessant moaning?,I had a friend who did this. The moans and grunts only happened when he was really high so I'm assuming he's close to ODing. This friend has ODed multiple times. He also doesn't remember any of the sound making either. Tell your friend to use less

337,Interaction between Seroquel and opiates?,I’m prescribed both...it definitely can be sedating but that’s a super low dose so you’ll probably be fine.  They wouldn’t prescribe them together if there was a major issue.

349,Codeine for pain?,"You won't get physical withdrawal right away. You'd have to do it every day for a month. But if you start up w this and you like it, you may someday find that a month has passed by and somehow you've been popping pills errday. Be careful"
350,Codeine for pain?,"Here is UK OTC codeine/DHC says not to take for more than 3 days as can cause addiction. It's such a manageable addiction though, I wouldn't worry. My GP wrote me 100 x 30/500 codeine after a dislocated shoulder, then another 100 after they ran out. That's 6g of codeine phosphate.

I wouldn't say the physical addiction came in until I moved up to 120mg dihydrocodeine and used at least twice a day for approx 3 and a half weeks. 
So I wouldn't worry. I'd advise listening to your body over the label on the box. Don't take every 4-6 hrs if you don't feel you need it. The as and when needed would be my advice."
351,Codeine for pain?,You’ll be fine taking it for a few weeks if your taking it only a few times a week. Just don’t start using it everyday and increasing your tolerance. You’ll know if it’s gunna be a problem.

You need to go into this with the mindset and keep the mindset that you aren’t going to take these once the pain has subsided over time.

357,Codeine for pain?,"More so something to worry about at high dosages for a consistently longer amount of time..everyone is different thought. You'd be surprised to see how many people can get addicted to opiates within a matter of days where others it can take months and some peoples tolerance is so weak it really messes them up at low dosages whereas others who have never even taken any opiates their whole life but require very high dosages for the marketed relief and effects. Benzos and opiates are strange that way..especially with all the generics nowadays. I personally have a tolerance or should I say it requires a large amount of pain relief meds to actually feel any relief whereas my lady can take a 10mg oxycodone hcl or apap and be messed up and have great pain relief where I would need like 100% more than that to feel any relief even tho I dont or havent taken any opies in a long ass time that's just how its always been. But these techniques are crazy awesome results..u should be fine at high dosages even consistently even if you go high dose and consistent on long term days it's an opiate so ofcourse can be addictive but as long as u have good bud indica weed, xanax, and bup u can use and get klean in a matter of 2 to 4 days physically and ofcourse thej mental recovery can come in which is the harder part honestly psychedelics help with this but ya when I need pain relief cuz my spine hurts beyond relief my main meds can privde il use strong opies and after 12 hours mostly 24 hours of smoking weed and xans in my mouth during which after last dose I dont even withdrawal and am able to sleep well still to but u do need to just relax and chill but is a home remedy for killing and not even having to deal with  withdrawal:
1. Indica nugs (high grades)
2. Xanax 2mg at least( other benzos can do the trick as well but make sure if they are ling acting like valium klonopin temazepam etc that u also have a fast acting benzo as well
3. Buprenorphine 8mg hcl (after 24 hours of last opiate dose)

Ie: soma
 gabapentin 
Clonidine 

After day 7 mental recovery and battles begins (boredom, anxiety, low self worth, mild depression, feeling isolated and worthless even no not true just part of recovery etc) this is when psychedelics really help as they cleanse the soul ie : lucy, spirit( best mental recovery for any addiction I took some spirit after iving h for years and years after a 5 min spirit trip my w.ds where completely gone before learned remedy), mdma, mushy etc)

And the

Soma 
Gabas
Clonidine

 are luxurys to this remedy are great to add to the remedy but not required the soma need at least 2 350mg tablets for the w.d help and to feel and more a luxury part for the remedy w.d to help relax and sleep and feel even more normal and same with the gaba and also helps pain when in w.d but these two are more so luxury parts to this recipe of having no opiate withdrawal. Trust me it works any questions feel free to ask"
358,Weed potentiates opiates for me. Anybody else feel something “missing” if they haven’t smoked once the opiates kick in? Weed and opiates are like PB&J,Weed when the opi high is wearing off is the best. Bumps it back into play I feel.
359,Weed when the opi high is wearing off is the best. Bumps it back into play I feel.,LOL WOW. I was literally just about to make a post on this. Because I just smoked 10 minutes ago and I swear it kicked it back in. I’m back to nodding again. How weird that I was just wondering “does anyone else feel like weed kicks opiates back in on the comedown?” Wow

366,Weed potentiates opiates for me. Anybody else feel something “missing” if they haven’t smoked once the opiates kick in? Weed and opiates are like PB&J,"Depends on if your a daily smoker already or if you just use every now and again... if you combine these on the daily the combo is amazing. I for one love taking dabs after and before I smoke... I also live in a legal state for trees so I can do this and I smoke throughout a day, everyday. So for me I love it, but maybe if the person only smokes on an occasion it could overwhelm the opiate high I don’t know... but yea I love smoking trees when I am being loyal to the foil."

Weed and opiates are like PB&J,"I used to consider it a waste of my opioids if I didn't have a few buds to smoke. The synergy between cannabis and dihydrocodeine was almost too perfect.
Then i got in to stronger opioids and the weed became less important. Don't get me wrong, I'd still take 100mg of morphine and a gram of bud over 120mg or morphine, but it was more important with the codeine family. Benzos are another great match for opioids. More dangerous though."

379,"I don't do pills I IV heroin but oh my god I love getting either that text or call saying to either walk out or head to ""the creek"" (which is a neighborhood that's a 2min drive away from my house, it's not actually called the creek that's just what we call it bc it has creek in the name) or Martin (which is a street that's like 7-10min away, I much prefer the closer venues but usually when he says this I don't have to do so much waiting beforehand for him to get to where we're gonna meet, also again that's not the real name bc I'm not trying to disclose my location since I believe that isn't allowed here).

Like I instantly become so much less sick when I know that I'm right about to pick up, and as soon as he either hands me my shit or throws it in my car my WDs subside completely and I'm on a mission to get the fuck home, as safely as I can making sure to follow all laws traffic and otherwise, but also as quickly as I can so I can hurry up and do the shit before I start to feel sick again and can't hit anymore.

But once I do hit the relief, rush, and high are all instant and that shit feels better than having 100 orgasms all at once. God I love shooting up so much, if you haven't already started don't ever do it bc you'll become addicted to it separately from your DoC","It's weird because I'm kind of the opposite. I'll be dope sick and feel some relief when I first get the call to come through but as soon as I get there, if I have to wait on him to make me up or something delays me, I start feeling sicker. It's like my brain starts screaming, ""ima make you feel sicker so you'll get this shit moving."" It gets worse if I cant hit too which suucks. It's hard enough for me to find a vein when I'm not sick. But yeah, I agree, I think at least 60% of my dope sickness is psychological."

Right before I get it or even when I have it in my hand but can’t do it yet is the worst sickness for me.
381,yes or when you’re running low or you’re on E and you’re about to pick up and you just know you won’t have to deal with being sick today? yeah i love that relief lol,Exactly that too! Getting the call from my guy saying “I re-upped” is amazing haha
382,Anybody else get this instantaneous feeling of “relief” as soon as the pills hit their stomach?,"The anticipation of knowing you’ll feel better soon. My anxiety and symptoms wouldn’t let up until I pushed that plunger down unfortunately. Usually I could feel it getting worse as I would get closer to picking up.

Honestly, from the time I would get the come through text to the second before I did my shot, I would always think “this is it. this is the time I won’t make it, and I’m gonna shit myself.” 

Thankfully, never happened. I have read many stories of the opposite ending for others though and I feel for them. lol"

385,Anybody else get this instantaneous feeling of “relief” as soon as the pills hit their stomach?,"Yup. Whenever I’m dopesick I immediately feel relief as soon as I pick up, before I even use at all. I’ve never been to jail but from what I’ve heard, detoxing in jail is somewhat easier than in the free world because you know you can’t do anything about it, so you’re not desperate to get high if that makes sense. Half the battle of detoxing is mental for sure."

387,Anybody else get this instantaneous feeling of “relief” as soon as the pills hit their stomach?,Yes! As soon as I've swallowed them I instantly feel calmer and a wave of relief rushes over me because I know everything is going to be better soon.
388,Anybody else get this instantaneous feeling of “relief” as soon as the pills hit their stomach?,"It's the placebo effect. The mind is a POWERFUL thing! Even if what you took was fake, you'd have that relief bc your mind believes that it's real. If you had 10 pills, half real half fake (but u didnt know about that part), mixed them up and took 1 a day, even the fake ones would give you relief. You can train your mind to process things that way and it helps in thousands of situations."

393,Anybody else get this instantaneous feeling of “relief” as soon as the pills hit their stomach?,I get this feeling just by driving to my pharmacy on refill day.  The actual drive relieves those symptoms right away.
394,Anybody else get this instantaneous feeling of “relief” as soon as the pills hit their stomach?,"Hell yes I do. The mind is a powerful thing, I don't even use enough to get sick for real, (not that ive never been there mind you) but I still feel kinda crappy after I've used a decent bit over a couple days or whatever.

 I used a decent amount of oxy the past two days and woke up today with only 1 left and didn't take it and felt pretty out of it up until I got to my dudes and got some more MBox 15s. I ate one as soon as he gave me them and instantly felt way better. Like when I ate the pill all that feeling of tiredness and just general apathy vanished before the thing even kicked in. 

Really crazy how that works. The mind makes a powerful connection between your DOC and that dopamine release, so much so that you get a hit of feel good chemicals when you know you are ingesting some. Shit that even can happen just when you see some! Its crazy how that works."
395,Anybody else get this instantaneous feeling of “relief” as soon as the pills hit their stomach?,"I've popped 4 x 20mg oxycodone at my front door as soon as I got my hands on them whilst in the depths of withfrawal, walked upstairs and threw them up out the window en route to my bedroom. 

I know what you mean though. I get an anxiety relief when my guy picks up the phone, ""you about?"" I ask... ""yeah man"". Hallelujah.
Ive also experienced some kinda relief/dopamine trickle on the way back from scoring with the gear in my hand. Powerful thing, the mind."
396,Anybody else get this instantaneous feeling of “relief” as soon as the pills hit their stomach?,"When i even get the pills if im ill, i instantly have that anxious/pooping feeling go away. I stop obsessing over imagining being well and i just feel more myself as soon as i have them in my hand."

402,Medication for PAWs?,Start working out
403,Medication for PAWs?,"Honestly I would said something for anxiety and depression from a doctor... those are the symptoms I always have... I would say smoking weed, but I know if I was sober and smoked some trees I would want some opiates after that. Go see a good psych who won’t judge you off your past, and get some help. I have always been able to deal with the physical shit, but the mental shit is what kills me and that’s PAWS for sure... worst part is depending on the person that shit can stay with your for a long, long ass time. Good luck."

415,Does bupenorphone block fentynal?,The H I got seems to bust through it pretty easy. Not taking but like 1-2mg of bupe at a time though.
416,Does bupenorphone block fentynal?,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equianalgesic
Check out this chart.. Shows relative strength of every opiate in relation to morphine. Bupe and fentanyl both on their. But to answer your question, it depends on the amount of bupe in system. At 16 mgs I think it's 96% of receptors are blocked. So at that dose, even fentanyl isn't getting you high."

424,How to dose heroin?,Gona be hard especially if it has been cut any. Never gonna get an exact amount of actual H.

427,Suboxone and weird temple headpressure / headache?,"Yep this happened to me a lot my first year on suboxone. I'd get this horrible, horrible pressure in my head... felt like a balloon blowing up in my head with throbbing pain. I tried many things. First thought it was from constipation / water retention... remember drinking loads of water, didn't help. Ibuprofen did nothing. The only thing that stopped the headaches I noticed when I tapered under 1mg a day they went away and never came back. The frequency of the headaches also slowed down the lower I got. However I have to mention this as I believe it's overlooked and never got to try it (you should). I was having horrible headaches this past month. I no longer take anything. I rarely get headaches except when I was taking sub. I noticed the 1 thing I WAS doing a lot of was drinking water. So I got a hunch, poured 2 tsp of Celtic Sea Salt into warm water.. within 10 mins I went from having the worse migraine of my life to COMPLETE RELIEF. Then I went on Google, started researching and saw a lot of other people getting rid of horrible headaches with regular sea salt water.  Now I put a tsp of Celtic Salt in my morning shake and haven't had a headache since. I don't know if it will work for you. But I do suspect many people just wash electrolytes out of their brain.. they get terrible dehydrated, confused and may overlook some of the most simple reasons why they have a headache which could be depletion of electrolytes. ERs hook you up to that saline before anything for a reason."
428,Suboxone and weird temple headpressure / headache?,I get a headache all the time on buprenorphine. Never in my roxi or opana. They make me sweat like a mfer also.

430,Suboxone and weird temple headpressure / headache?,"Happened to me almost everytime i tried it. was taking as low of a dose as I could too. Would always feel nauseous too. The headaches/pressure were DEF just a response to subs, nothing that ever happened when i was sober (b4 addiction) or while i was using any other opi. Still makes me want to avoid them over trying to taper this time around :("
431,Suboxone and weird temple headpressure / headache?,"I had to stop taking subs because of how bad the headaches were. Id get nauseous and not eat right. Sometimes throw up. The only thing that helped *sometimes, not even all the time* was smoking weed, and a cool cloth on my forehead. And id have to take a nap. Which isn't ideal with having to live, work, and function like a normal human during the day. So I switched to methadone and they never happen anymore."
432,Anyone one here have kaiser as insurance and how good is it with someone e Tory to get off opiates?,"Kaiser is better than nothing, but I would not trust them with anything really important.

Instead I don’t feel nearly as high as I did when I did the first 20.

477,Just how well does kratom work for opioid withdrawal?,"I know someone who dosed 10g every 5 hours coming off H cold turkey. A LOT of Kratom to be sure. On day 12 of exactly the same dosage he passed out and became jaundiced. Fast forward to ER and he was in 'limbo' with AST and ALT in the 500 600's and billirubin hovering around 16 (very high). Toxicologist on call was not familiar with Kratom intoxication and as is sometimes the case with DILI (drug induced liver injury) wouldn't opine as to whether recovery or total failure and death was the more likely outcome. Thankfully on day 5 his lfts (liver function values) began to trend the right way and he fully recovered. Just a cautionary, true story that Reddit seems to not ever want to hear. Oh well."
478,Just how well does kratom work for opioid withdrawal?,"I only used kratom a couple times when dude was dry for a few days. Although I’m usually a pretty positive person, being dope sick and thinking I wasn’t picking up that day kinda shit on any positivity I normally had. 

Thankfully someone had sent my boyfriend and I several different kinds of kratom cause we mentioned we wanted to try it. I think it was like 10g each of 6 or 7 different strains. Don’t remember which one I tried first and I only did like 3-4g, but it definitely helped my mood to get me going for the day. I was working at a hospital at the time as an X-ray tech and I really couldn’t call out without consequences. It helped alleviate wd symptoms, but only for like 2-3 hours. I didn’t think to bring it with me in case I wanted to redose. So the rest of my day just got shittier and sweatier, until that night we ended up finding something else.

Whenever I used the others, they seemed to help somewhat whether it was my mood, energy, or helping me relax, but it never lasted very long. I probably just needed to up the amount I was taking, but I haven’t tried it since.

That kratom you have must be premium cause I can’t imagine anything except subs or done to help with fent. How many gs do you use in a dose?"

517,Is there a way to lower tolerance without stop taking opiodis? (it's for chronic pain so please I really need advices since my quality of life is going really down),"I was able to lower my dose. I'm a cancer patient and I take a pretty high dose of oxy every day but I didn't want my tolerance to get out of control. So I started cutting my dose in half. I did that for a month and when I went back to my regular dose it worked so much better. That month was not fun though, I used kratom on top of the decreased dose of oxy and I took a lot of ibuprofen. But I made it through that month and it really made a huge difference.  Being that you only take 10 mg and its extended release, this might be really hard for you. That's a super low dosage but it would at least keep you from going into with drawls. If you're waking up at a 10 out of 10 I don't know that you're gonna be able to do this . your best bet is to talk to your doctor and be completely honest about how it's just not working anymore. Also nalaxone has like no oral bioavailability. It should not throw you into withdrawals if you take that medication as directed"

Have you considered switching to a different opioid for a bit? My PM said she sometimes finds that people have to swap every few years because the dose no longer works like it did. So she said if that happens and they can’t tolerate a higher dose she will swap them to a different med. two that are frequently swapped are apparently oxycodone and hydrocodone. (7.5mg hydrocodone is about 5mg oxycodone so you can do the math). Or maybe you need to try zohydro (ER version) with your oxy for break through. It might be worth asking about at your next visit.

If you are using a consistent dose to lower (exp. 5mg for 10 days and then 2mg for ten days, etc.) However if you take 5mg and then 2mg and then 10mg over 3 days, your tolerance/effects of the drug would be inconsistent. You have to take the meds  with consistency like a schedule. (Exp. If you drink 1 beer Monday, then 2 beers Tuesday you'll get a buzz but if you only drink one on Wednesday your buzz would be lower, think of it that way.) There will be a link added to this later. Please check it out."
532,Is there a way to lower tolerance without stop taking opiodis? (it's for chronic pain so please I really need advices since my quality of life is going really down),"Yes, opiates want to push your hormones down. Hormone levels dropping over time, leads to decreased production of the feel good amines. So there is no 1 catalyst in this reaction. There are many. Take a good mutli-vitamin stacked on top of a good mutli-B vitamin that's isolated. Only B vitamins at higher 100mg doses. Add on top of that zinc, magnesium, potassium, sodium, iodine for the thyroid which communicates with the pitutary and also makes hormones that help secret enkephalin & peptides. Keep it low to moderate the iodine. Consider only taking it 2-3 times a week & always with sea salt or you can get crude bromine headaches. Then do only 1mg of lithium ornate twice a week. Lithium is also an important trace mineral that noones takes & helps balance hormone production though too much is stressful on the thyroid & kidneys (which is why I recommend a low dose). And always with sea salt, top off all the LNAA amino acids as isolated as possible in the diet, l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, d-phenylalanine potentiates opiates, l-citrulline also potentiates opiates through increased NO production. Vitamin D & fish oils for circulation. Many things will build up in your system over time & catalyze / potentiate a much stronger reaction chain in your brain. But the key is to implement all these things strategically over a year or 2. I do this prime & trigger thing in my own health. The metals are minerals. The metals are catylsts like lithium makes meth or iodine makes meth too.. these are critical catalysts your brain needs along with many other metals, dopamine, seretonin, enkephalin precursor aminos... when all the precursors, salts, aminos build up in your system & you activate it with any drug the reaction will be at it's strongest."

577,How long does it take for your body to get used to a lower dosage?,Usually about a week or so your tolorance goes down a bit
578,Usually about a week or so your tolorance goes down a bit,A week or two and you'll be ok.
579,How long does it take for your body to get used to a lower dosage?,"Myself, 3 or 4 days is how long it takes me when I halve my dosages."
580,How long does it take for your body to get used to a lower dosage?,"Well for me i was getting the same exact good ecp dope for like 6 months. I went to a 5 day detox ( 5 nights and left on the 6th day) and was easily handling 0.25 gram shots 3 times per day. Went there and got out the 6th day and copped a 20 bag (0.1) the day i got out and could barely handle a tenth of that 20 bag.  So i went from easily doing .25 to almost falling out from .01 in just under a week. But just like how my tolerance was gone in 6 days, on the 3rd day i was back to wanting more than .25 per shot.

That was heroin and fent dope and the fentalogue lasted similar time as heroin. It wasnt carfent that lasts 24 hours.  So with you being on methadone youll probably need longer to adjust. Maybe 10-14 days. Either way you won't be dope sick from 60 to 30mg.  Maybe going from 60 to 10. I can do 100$ a day every day then only have 20-30 and be fine . you won't be high but you'll just feel normal for awhile"
581,How long does it take for your body to get used to a lower dosage?,I've gone from 3x80 oxy and 6x15 oxycodone SLOWLY down to 3x30 and 5x15.  Cutting in half is harsh but a few steps isnt bad

591,"Chewed 90mg Oxycodone IR, just a meh high :/. Did chewing weaken the pills somehow?", No you wouldn’t have lost potency.   Maybe your pills are pressed and they are varying in strength?    Well snorting you don’t need to take 90mg.   You’d do maybe one pill every 40 min to an hour

I remember taking 40mg of hydrocodone and being pretty blown and nice. Then a week later I take a little more and I was super fucking disappointed.

601,"Chewed 90mg Oxycodone IR, just a meh high :/. Did chewing weaken the pills somehow?","Depending how much you chewed them and how long they were in your mouth, some might have absorbed through your oral mucosa (similar to sublingual). Any oxy absorbed like that would bypass the first pass metabolism in the liver, where some oxycodone converts to oxymorphone. That's part of why snorting is shorter lasting and less euphoric than eating oxycodone, in addition to bioavailability. Depending on your exact metabolism, you might convert a relatively high proportion of swallowed oxycodone to oxymorphone, compared to the average person in your first pass metabolism. So by chewing, you would miss out on some oxymorphone, and so have a weaker high because you had the crushed up pills in your mouth. That's the only reason I can see for the high to be less because of chewing"

604,Have any of you ever gotten tattoos to cover track marks?,Treat the track marks with vitamin E oil for a couple weeks before you go get the tattoo.

If you go to a shop the artist will be able to work with you and will likely have some suggestions as to the type of tattoo you should get. Congrats on your clean time btw.

I always snorted the heroin and swallowed the pills. Anyway, I highly recommend covering any and all track marks with tattoos. ESP if you’re planning on putting this chapter of your life behind you. They don’t have to mean anything either. Don’t let others shame you about “sentiment”. I just picked one that looked cool. A naked chick with wings inside the bend of my arm.

668,How do you guys make your H last longer?,Dose in the morning before work whatever you need to get out of bed to do for the day. And DONT dose until your nose is running and you're truly feeling the starting signs of withdrawal. The thing is we as addicts justify in our mind reasons to dose early. That's why it almost never works out. I know it sucks but having someone to control your stash and give you doses when you really need them helps granted that person doesnt use too and wouldn't touch your shit and truly wants to help you

697,Opium tea - dissapointment?,"Actually... as an avid lover of this special tea... This stuff has the full alkaloid profile, which, work together to indice an entirely different effect than what you might have been expecting.  I personally LOVE it.  You won't get a rush..but your body should get replaxed, warm and heavy.. your stomach should feel nice and tingly... and your overall mood light and happy.  It can take up to 45 mins for full effect especially of you did not drink on an empty stomach.

Edit- as far as alkaloid content.. only a lab can tell you that. The range is so broad from pod to pod that there is no way to accurately judge how much morphine, codeine,  thebaine, papaverine, etc is in it.  I was a user for so long that I quite literally aquired the ability to taste and smell the alkaloid content... which, shouldn't come as a shock..lol.  basically,  if it smells somewhat dank, earthy.. almost like dirt with a very bitter, flavor, you are good.  If its got a sort of peppery smell or flavor...or of its got a very sickly sweet ish kind of taste and more of a milky white color, do not drink that shit."

There are too many factors involved. The only safe way to do this is to slowly go up in dose giving time in between for your body to clear the previous dose. It would be irresponsible of anyone to give you a specific number.

This would be easy enough for you to test though: take the same dose of Oxy-only IR tablets with an equivalent amount of acetaminophen and see what happens. I suspect it won't change anything as for what you feel. 

Sometimes generic medications are just weaker than they are supposed to be. Generics are supposed contain the same active ingredient plus or minus up to 20%, but from my experience and if you do some research online you will find that generic medicines can in reality vary more than this. 

Another possibility: are these pills coming directly from a pharmacy? If not I suppose it's possible they are fake pressed pills."

I'd say a month clean. Otherwise you will just feel a nasty promethazine antihistamine garbage feeling.

If those subs were your first time doing opiates, maybe 5 days.  For me codeine is so weak any amount of residual subs will block it.

Check out the drug half life calculator. After 120 hours you will still have 0.5mg in your system down from 30mg. That amount will block codeine IMO."

These are things that the junkie population I unwilling interact with are not versed in. TBH, Carfent is the only analogue that I have even heard someone say out loud other than norfent being mentioned in jurassic world when they discussed using it as a method to  take down the badass genetically engineered dinosaur. I’m going to do some research before I start spewing bullshit claims. I’m in an outpatient treatment program that drug tests me 1-2 times a week, and they only test for Fent a small percentage of the time due to funding. They have a separate little stick test they have to use to test for F. The main test is very extensive though; it tests for morph, oxy&hydromor&cod, beup, and a few others that I’m not going to claim to know for sure. I ordered tests of my own in bulk so that I can make sure I pass, as I am still actively using. I always have fake urine that I added beup to Incase they are going to test for F, but I always pee in the cup if I can to avoid trouble. I have a good 5 min warning if they’re going to test for F because the tech orders the test over the phone in front of me, but the fake is always ready to go. I occasionally pop positive for other opioids when I test myself, but it’s become a pretty rare occurrence. The H in my area is predominately brown H from south/Central America, with the ocassional appearance of Asian; tar is a unicorn. The cut of choice in my area is mannitol for F and H, but i am unaware of the other potential filler material."

I honestly don't even think it matters if someone is kratom dependent since everyone's dependent on something and kratom is like $150/kilo which is fucking nothing.

I didn't buy another bag after the kilo though and neither did anyone I tried it with just because taking the raw powder is disgusting. Putting it in a capsule makes it a lot better, but even still it's a huge hassle. I personally see it as completely harmless since the method of ingestion is so shitty and the price is so low, and it is used to treat wd's from heroin, and in comparison to alcohol again, you basically get no buzz from kratom compared to how insanely drunk you can get, so it's not like it's a hazard in that way either, at least any more than alcohol.

Everyone I’m with does not have close to the affects that they have on me, but I do have severe vitamin deficiency’s so my health is not perfect so maybe they affect me more intensely?","I commented below but just want to clarify what I said.   

True drug allergies are quite uncommon and most people who claim a drug allergy actually only had an adverse reaction to the medication. These are two very different phenomena. 

The reason I said it is likely not an allergic reaction is because allergic reactions have a very specific set of symptoms depending on the substance causing the allergy. Regarding drug allergies, our bodies have an exaggerated immune response to a certain chemical in the medication.  So at some point, our bodies saw it (the drug/chemical within the drug) as a threatening invader. It then produced antibodies against that chemical. These antibodies are the protectors of our life. They are like soldiers fighting off attempted invasion by enemy forces.  Once a soldier has visualized his target once (color of uniform, movement characteristics color of skin or sounds of the language spoken) the recognition is much quicker the next time he sees one. 

When the immune response is against something that is actually a threat..,it can save our lives. Immunity against certain viral infections is a good example of an appropriate response.When exposed for a second time the body already knows what the threat is and has Ab already formed whose sole purpose is removing the threat from the body.   The same holds true for vaccines. 

When our bodies launches an immune response to something that isn’t a threat is when it can become problematic. Pollen is not a threat to our lives. However if our bodies were tricked Into believing it was a threat, we formed Ab to pollen so that next time it shows up we have a very quick exaggerated response. Symptoms of pollen allergy include sneezing, runny nose, watery itchy eyes, etc. All of these actions encourage flushing of pollen out of the body. 

Common reactions to drug allergies are similar. Symptoms include rash/urticaria, swelling, wheezing or coughing, feeling dizzy and can include vomiting but it is almost always accompanied by other symptoms if it is an allergy.

I'll never be squeaky clean cuz of chronic pain, but not committing felonies and shooting fent every day is good enough for me.

1030,How long after cocaine can I safely use opiates?,"Sooo I dont know what is considered safely here.

I recently went on a coke binge for much longer than I should have and there were several times I would finish my last line of coke and 20 mins later crush up an 8mg dilaudid and about 45 mins after my last line of coke I'd have snorted 8mg of dilaudid.

The feeling was nice and honestly was the only way I could fall asleep at a decent time. About 2 hours after finishing coke I'd take 3 benadryl am(which also helped extend the dilaudid a bit)

People do speedballs often which is coke mixed with heroin sooo I dont think they interact crazily but I could be wrong.

On a side note as I have now destroyed my septum and have a 2mm hole (basically a non existent septum) I seriously recommend using saline rinses after a night of snorting anything especially coke. I cant even describe how uncomfortable this is and how much pain it causes my face and headaches.

I honestly go through phases, like a few months of really being into certain drugs that require snorting, then move onto something. Inevitably I end up doing a circle. Now I'm back in my pill stage, mainly stimulants like adderall, and suboxone or oxy. I ended up doing some adderall impulsively, so I'm still up. The only opioid I have is suboxone, which gives me stimulant like effects, and I can't sleep so now I'm drinking. 

I'm just super buggy about coke, just cuz I never know what it's cut w/ and it kinda kills my high, just who I am. I honestly dk how you guys can do coke and H w/out the anxiety, I wish I could. If I KNEW it was 100%, I'd be totally fine and would enjoy it np. But duly noted, saline, thx bruvva"
1032,How long after cocaine can I safely use opiates?,Well my best advice is to take it 5 hours ago.

1035,How long after cocaine can I safely use opiates?,You should be fine. Your body metabolizes 14 gs of alcohol per hour. Theres 14gs of alcohol in a beer. Your body destroys half the cocaine you consumed every hour after 5 hours the cocaine left is neglible(6-3%). Cocaethylene has a slightly longer half life but not by much.

1037,How long after cocaine can I safely use opiates?,I’m not advising to do this but I’ve taken both at once and had no problems. So I think just wait a few hours and you’ll be just fine.
1038,How long after cocaine can I safely use opiates?,"Dude I honestly think that you're good. Im not a big coke guy, but if someone has it I'm down. So after a night of maybe a gram or two of blow and some liquor, there's nothing better than opiates. I usually give it like an hour, smoke a joint, take a shower, maybe do some chores to make the time go by faster, then I take my opiates. Unless you're still completely blasted from blow or dehydrated from the alcohol, you should be fine. Give it enough time for your body to ""reset"" and then go for it. I've combined opiates and coke, so I figure they're fine one after the other. Not ""safe"" because nothing is ever safe when mixing drugs, but I wouldn't expect anything bad to happen to you if you use opiates 1 hour or so after blow"

1043,How long after cocaine can I safely use opiates?,I've always preferred using my cocaine with my opiates. Did speedballs all yesterday and it was great.

1051,What’s your opinion on a significant other hiding your medication and dictating when you should take it?,I'm pretty sure that's incredibly illegal almost anywhere as well as being a massive dick move.
1052,What’s your opinion on a significant other hiding your medication and dictating when you should take it?,"Nope.  Not a chance.

First of all, you can have seizures from benzo withdrawal, so if you have taken Klonopin steadily for any length of time, you can't just not take it.  

Effexor isn't deadly if you stop it abruptly, but you sure might wish you would.  It's an SNRI, and side effects of stopping include confusion, headaches, sleep changes my all-time favorite, brain zaps.  Even when people are weaned down slowly, they usually get these brain zaps and they're miserable.  I personally get them when I miss one dose of Effexor."
1053,What’s your opinion on a significant other hiding your medication and dictating when you should take it?,"That's horrendous dude. I was in a relationship with a controlling woman, who would physically steal my vape because she said I was doing it too much, after I bought the vape because she didn't like the smell of smoke. I felt really really shitty about myself, when I was with her, because I felt like I wasn't good enough for her. I felt as though, ""well, if she has to control what I'm doing then obviously I'm not a good person."
1054,What’s your opinion on a significant other hiding your medication and dictating when you should take it?,"She is a control freak and what shes doing is not ok. She is not in your body and should have no say in what you take. These are obviously prescription,  so you and your doctor have already come to the conclusion that you need them. Her opinion is irrelevant. I was in control of some of my boyfriend's medications when he got back from rehab, but those were only the controlled ones and only because he asked me to. Your effexor? I cannot think of one reason for her to hold an anti-depressant (again...she needs to be in control. This is NOT NORMAL behavior). If you were an ex benzo addict and she was doling out your klonopin, I can kind of understand that. The rest of this is unacceptable. Those are your prescriptions, you have control over when you take them. What she's doing is illegal actually if you didn't give her permission. Tell her to give you your meds back"
1055,What’s your opinion on a significant other hiding your medication and dictating when you should take it?,Unacceptable. You should be taking Effexor every day at the same time to avoid withdrawal symptoms. That’s cruel of her
1056,What’s your opinion on a significant other hiding your medication and dictating when you should take it?,Leave that bitch wtf. Power trippin hoe.
1057,What’s your opinion on a significant other hiding your medication and dictating when you should take it?,"Hell no. Not those meds. You need those on a steady basis. It’s not like rationing opiates, mental health meds are nothing to screw around with. She’s doing you way more harm than good."
1058,What’s your opinion on a significant other hiding your medication and dictating when you should take it?,That's fucked up. You need to find them and hide them yourself. Next time you get your script at the pharmacy hide them.

NO, but seriously man - that is fucked. Have a talk with her. If she doesn't understand or accept that you need medial assistance, shes not for you and you're not for her. Easy as that.

Mutual Respect is a fundamental law in love.
What shes doin is not respectful."
1069,What’s your opinion on a significant other hiding your medication and dictating when you should take it?,"More info on the situation

This girl is my fiancée, I’m not going to dump her. 

I have a benzo addiction, opiate Addiction, and basically a pill addiction for three years. It really fucked up my mental health. I went to a doctor and these meds are what he decided to prescribe me. I take my medicine responsibly but she thinks I’m going to go back to my old ways so she took control of my medication schedule. I get anxiety attacks even asking for my meds. I love this girl to death así again I’m not dumping her. She has a good reason to hide my meds but at the same time I’m not the person I used to be and I don’t think it’s healthy the way she dictates when I should take them when she has no idea what the medication is for. I’ve asked her many times to research them so she understands but she shuts the conversation down every time. She hates pills in general because as a kid she was put on meds (Zoloft, lexapro etc). So I’m stuck in a rock and a hard place. I’m an anxious mess.

I’m diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, GAD, agoraphobia. And major panic disorder."
1070,What’s your opinion on a significant other hiding your medication and dictating when you should take it?,"This is unacceptable. Did you at any point agree to this arrangement? Actually it doesn't even matter - what you need to do is tell her to give you your prescriptions back, and make sure she can't get to them if you think she might take your meds again against your will. 

Walmart sells this little pouch with a combination lock that I like to use as a deterrent to people stealing my meds, but obviously someone could just take the entire pouch. Definitely don't give her your medication to hold onto again. Put your foot down. She is causing you severe distress by depriving you of medication that helps you. If your girlfriend pushes back, I would suggest either breaking up with her, or if you don't want to do that, bring her to your next doctor appointment and explain to your doctor what's been happening, so that he can explain to her how important it is for your to take your medication on a regular basis. 

It's unfortunate how some people who know nothing about medications think they know better and try to impose their will on others. Good luck to you, and if you have an update I'd like to hear what happens."

I still keep a stash at all times.  Just because if I want to smoke... I’ll have it.  But I regret it every single time I fire it up. 

It’s hard to say if age was my main factor or my opiate addiction because my addiction began around the age of 30.

Used to love smoking in my younger days and miss it so every year or so I try it again in hopes maybe it will help me cut back on other drugs but it just gives me anxiety and usually a bad headache and makes me throw up,"Damn, you guys should google that, it's a legit thing. Weed after awhile isn't good for your gut. I saw something about it on a r/petioles thing I think"

I can potentiate the nod from oxy alot by smoking weed but then again on buprenorphine i find that weed makes me more anxious.

A few of them are wishy-washy and say bullshit like ""decriminalization"" instead of legalization. But on a national scale, with how much $$$ the illegal drug market is worth, no one is going to want decriminalization when we could have another $100 billion in the US economy. Not to mention all the legal and taxable jobs it would bring.

Honestly ending Drug Prohibition would have so many benefits it's ridiculous. Literally the only downside is a slight initial increase of drug users that will almost definitely level out in less than a decade. That's the only downside. Drug Prohibition is way worse for society than anything drugs could ever do."

Just a couple weeks ago I was in a horrendous flare, and methadone and oxy weren't even touching the pain.  Every 1.5-2 hours I got up to have a gravity (gravity bong hit, it's all I smoke out of) of some nice top shelf indica and wax, and it actually mellowed the insane storm of pain that was raging in my joints.

The 20 to 25 % thc weed thats around now just fucks me up.. I can't speak I get paranoid! It's like taking acid some times.

There was an interesting study done by King's University here in London where they did blind tests with different strengths or more precisely different balances of THC and CBD, it seemed to find CBD  counter acts the phyco active effects of THC

1247,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"No if you keep your smokes spaced out its amazing top 5 drugs out there. 24/7 use feels like absolute shit. you dont feel euphoria on it but you feel bored as shit without it.
The real question should be who tf said benzos are recreational. Like theres absolutely no euphoria unless you need it for anxiety. Why do benzos when you can buy any other drug even dxm is better."
1248,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,Anything with a psycadelic aspect will make you realize things you've been repressing. If you took a break from weed while you liked it and when you came back it was shitty you have a negative point of view towards yourself or your surroundings. If surroundings are the same you changed.

I do enjoy it when I don't get paranoid though, but I'm afraid to try it because I get paranoid 90% of the time. If I take 1 small puff I might be ok. Maybe try different strains like Indica or what not? It sucks because I love getting buzzed and weed is so readily available, I feel like I'm missing out."
1250,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"i find weed combos well with anything except stimulants, /w em it makes me paranoid and sometimes psychotic. good for comedowns though"
1251,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"You’re definitely describing a sativa-dominant strain. You need an indica to eat half your fridge door and sink into your couch like pocket change. 

High THC concentration often results in deep introspection that too easily devolves into straight up paranoia. Confusion, anxiety, etc. Most people don’t know how to channel these effects productively (because they can in fact be ideal for music making & consumption, or TV/Movies, for instance), especially if they’ve had a lot. I revert to how much I love my family and how much I’ve pained them.. so I’m fighting back tears while I’m getting my ass handed to me in FIFA. Def not for everyone, but I still love it, for some strange reason 

The stonier strains that can put you in bed or enhance a nod (indicas, great for WD!!) have high CBD content that also has the effect of counteracting all that THC Jedi Mind Trick shit sativas play on your head meat. A nice rip of this can put junkie ass to bed mid-kick (for a couple hours, at least.) Most junkies would really stand to benefit from strains high in CBD during kicks. (Sobriety & indica may whet the appetite for something a little more.. noddy... so don’t let the guard down, too!)"
1252,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Weed is such a boring drug. I mean I guess nothing compares to opiates, but man, all the different times I’ve smoked weed have been let downs. Definitely not my cup of tea."
1253,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Weed used to be the shit for me. I got a medical card for it to help with my stomach and intestinal issues (pain, nausea, acid reflux, gas, etc. every day, still have these issues) and it worked pretty well for me for a while. I didn’t really get much anxiety, and it didn’t make a drastic difference with my stomach issues, but it did help. I was definitely smoking excessively, though. My tolerance was so fucked that not even a gravity bong would get me stoned for more than a few minutes. 

For months I kept on smoking, and despite my crazy tolerance it was going alright for me. That is until one day I was smoking out of a bong, and I took a couple hits and then my stomach issues just starting acting up like crazy. I had serious stomach pain and unrelenting nausea, and of course my gut problems make me anxious so I started to panic a bit on top of that. I tried it a couple times after that, and each time the stomach problems just got worse, even with a single tiny hit. 

I took a long break from weed, but one day I decided I wanted to try it again, to see if anything had changed. I took literally the smallest hit off of a bong, to the point where I could barely see the smoke when I blew it out. Same shit happened, and it lasted for over 2 hours. That was a long time ago, and it definitely cemented it for me that I’ll never be able to smoke weed again. Same thing with alcohol. I tolerated it just fine until one day I just didn’t, and my body basically rejected it. I can no longer drink without getting sick, and I have a phobia of getting sick so I pretty much can never drink or smoke weed for the rest of my life. :/"
1254,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"On weed I feel weird af. If I smoke enough the world starts looking not real. Like a video game almost, and my motor skills are gone. When sun hits my face I feel like I'm on fire. Also I have this weird buzzing feeling in my head

I prefer some speeeeeed and molly"
1255,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I mean, I loved smoking. Then I would get real introspective and fully realize I was sticking needles into myself/totally reliant on heroin. So maybe that has to do with why"
1256,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Yeah I used to think this way until I stopped trying to get as high as possible when I smoked. Next time, just try a little bowl pack and see if you like it."
1257,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,You probably do way too much
1258,You probably do way too much,Nah
1259,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"i think its 100% to do with tolerance. When I use to smoke a lot I liked it, never got anxious. Now that I hardly ever smoke its way too strong. I kinda stopped when I started having chronic pain because i found it made the pain worse."
1260,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Same. But I find indica strains, low dose, works good.  Less head, more body.  High in CBD too takes away the anxiety.  Edibles and tinctures are the way to go"
1261,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,Weed tolerance:  use it or lose it.
1262,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I kinda feel like once you take something that fries up your dopamine receptors a little, that smoking weed then doesnt become very pleasurable as you get all the 'psychedelic' effects , paranoia and anxiety but no pleasant rush or feeling for the fact the dope receptors have already took a good kicking. Used to be a 100% pothead from 13 onwards, then around 16 I began to abuse mephedrone and amphet for close on to 2 years, now unless I take benzos getting high for the first time in a day is guaranteed panic and highly exacerbated by opiates too/vice versa the weed exacerbates the background panic brought on by the morphine/oxy (prescribed, following a broken neck and upper spine) and hydromorphone gave me the mother of all panic attacks to the point i went back down to morphine after 3 days. Wouldn't have really gone into all this but seems there are an awful lot of is in the same boat out there ? :/"
1263,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Get a strand high in CBD. CBD has antipsychotic properties, which can offset the psychotic properties of THC."
1264,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I personally love weed but I know a lot of people who also get very anxious after smoking, sometimes it happens to me as well when a lot of shit is going on in my life. As others have suggested maybe try taking some benzos before you smoke."
1265,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Yeah well its 50/50 for me. I mostly feel stupid,slow and not focused when i smoke it. 
I still smoke it almost everyday tho when im out of opiates. 😂😂"
1266,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,I used to be stoned pretty much all the time. Then I started getting weird feelings and paranoia. Now I can only enjoy it when I'm drunk. I kinda hate weed it makes people so boring. And they advocate it like some miracle drug with no drawbacks.
1267,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,it's weird it feels like it's lost it's magic I'll have a few cones throughout the day while working and that and it doesn't seem to really effect me that much even when I'm just kicking back and smoking it's lost it's touch and it's not tolerance either I had a 6 month break the second half of last year and when I went back to it it still didn't feel right
1268,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I didn't like weed much when I was on opiates and benzos and medication, I felt so uncomfortable and anxious when smoking, but I found it really helped when I wanted to quit everything, and now I only smoke and it keeps me sane and happy and away from opiates. If I mix with pills/chemicals I still tend to be a little anxious. 
I liked the mirror-metaphor someone in the comments wrote. Weed makes you see yourself without the fog of chemicals and it can be brutal."
1269,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I think it’s a combination of tolerances, more potent weed than regularly seen before, at least for most. Also higher ratios of thc to cbd, making for a less calm and relaxing high, hell I’d seen indicas tested that have less than a tenth of a percent of any cbd. 

I’d been smoking for years and while it’s changed, it’s not a total change. I still find and come across strains that don’t give me any anxiety or paranoia what so ever, they’re just way fewer and far between than they were previously. And when it’s not, it’s generally the first smoke of the day, for a good twenty or thirty minutes my mind will race and I feel my heart thumping, just adding to it. It’s not terrible though, I still love bud.

 I mean what can you expect really when an entire industry has pretty much turned to focusing on one specific cannabinoid in the highest concentrations possible. 

Either just roll with punches and try to learn your body and more of what it wants or it’s probably not good to at all if you don’t enjoy it or can’t get over whatever problem your having with it. I use to smoke crack for months straight, so a few minutes of questioning myself if I’m okay and having a noticeable heart beat aren’t really shit to me as I KNOW everything’s good, as well as when the later smoke sessions don’t come with that. 

Maybe try treating it like you would if you were drinking when you don’t like drinking. I hate the taste. If I got from nothing to smashing shots, I’m probably puking on the second or third. That alcohol taste just doesn’t agree on a sober mind tongue. But ease into the intoxicated state, and I can keep up. Still may make me sick, but my mind and body handle it far better."
1270,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I’ve met quite a few people who liked it until they got into opioids. Then it started causing them problems. 

I had to quit smoking for a few years because weed would exacerbate withdrawal symptoms for me. 

I have read that CBD is an allosteric modulator of the opioid receptors. Maybe the two drug types interfere with one another in some way. 

Now that I’m presently clean from opioids, weed feels enjoyable again."
1271,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I'm in the same boat. Honestly happy to see I'm not the only one. As a Florida resident of 50 years I obtained my Med Marijuana License but I'm having a difficult time with consumption. Yes, I need pain relief but I dont want paranoia in order to receive it. Lmao!"
1272,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"smoking weed used to make me feel anxiety free and at peace but now when i smoke i can’t help but get paranoid and start getting too deep into my head, i think i might take a break from it for awhile."
1273,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"yeah I feel like it’s kinda boring/a bit of a let down, it tends to make me feel a bit weird/dissociated tbh"
1274,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I agree that not all the effects of weed makes me feel great, but I find the nausea from other things like shrooms/lsd, opes, and alcohol all make me feel way worse than weed ever could. I also find cigarettes make me feel way more like I'm dying when I smoke them, like they are actively destroying my lungs, whereas weed just feels like it burns/stings but not like my lungs are actually covered in shit. I've had mild panic attacks but I can always handle them since I know they come and go, and I had a mind shattering one on LSD that makes weed anxiety feel like nothing, and even for that one I cooled down to just being high as fuck pretty quick.

At this point though I smoke weed because everything else seems objectively worse for you, or is way more addictive, or doesn't let you be nearly as functional, or is way more expensive, or is just really shitty to ingest."
1275,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Does anyone know of something that gives you the physical effects without the ""self analytic"" headspace?

I'm on valium already for anxiety, so adding extra doesn't help much with the thought loops.

I just want that physical release, to get loose like that and stretch out. I've tried almost everything and soma was the only thing that came close .. well oxy too but that was long ago before tolerance. Thx"
1276,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,Sounds like weed turned on yall. Try few hits of indica and you good....... sativa is a no no
1277,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,Yup I can’t smoke it I get too paranoid and anxious
1278,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,I wonder how many people end up getting turned off weed because they have a couple hits of a pure sativa and that negative experience is enough to turn them off ALL weed? Though there a a few exceptions to the sativa rule for me. Give me a nice 70/30 indica any day

1320,You a toothpick my man?!,Stick bug actually
1321,"How many hydros (or mg) could I take before I potentially OD? I’m 5 foot 8 and 110 pounds, male.","hydrocodone is almost always paired with tylenol (acetaminophen/paracetamol/APAP) and you'd overdose and die from the APAP before the opioid portion killed you. hydrocodone has a very high LD50 in rats (~375mg/kg), so assuming a perfect carryover to humans would mean 18,750mg hydrocodone, or 1,875 norcos, would be needed for an opioid overdose - however, that'd also be 609,375 mg APAP which is enough to destroy over 40 people's livers and kill them.

you shouldn't take more than 2,000 mg APAP at once or 4,000 mg APAP per day. safe dose is up to 6 x 5,7.5,10 mg hydrocodone/325 APAP pills and absolutely no alcohol. that's 30-60mg of hydrocodone depending on your pill strength ... realistically you can go over a little bit if it's once in a while, but definitely keep is under ~5-6g APAP and minimize alcohol. APAP overdoses are no fun, they're extremely painful and can result in death, so be careful. if you think you're even close to overdosing, drink a scoop of whey protein to help boost your glutathione metabolic pathway and reduce APAP overdose severity."
1322,"How many hydros (or mg) could I take before I potentially OD? I’m 5 foot 8 and 110 pounds, male.",How many do you have?
1323,How many do you have?,About 2 bottles with 30 hydros in both

1325,"How many hydros (or mg) could I take before I potentially OD? I’m 5 foot 8 and 110 pounds, male.",No more than 40mg to start if you have no tolerance.
1326,"How many hydros (or mg) could I take before I potentially OD? I’m 5 foot 8 and 110 pounds, male.",If no tolerance you should start with 10-20mg. 30-40 probably would give uncomfortable side effects. More than 50mg+ would start to be dangerous
1327,"How many hydros (or mg) could I take before I potentially OD? I’m 5 foot 8 and 110 pounds, male.",Honestly you should only need to worry about overdosing on the acetaminophen which is 6000mg for a average sized male (6ft 180lb) youd most likely overdose on that before you actually overdosed on the hydros

1329,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,a lot of drugs do this. I can’t exactly pinpoint why but i’ve been through this as well.
1330,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,"They do the same to me. I think it's for a few different reasons.

1. I don't really like people all that much, but if I am not using and home alone I get really antsy and anxious easily. Human contact helps take my mind off that. If I am using then I am perfectly content at home with myself and prefer it that way.
2. I think the stigma of being an opiate addict gets to me. I'm a reasonably attractive woman and you probably would never guess I was an addict unless you saw my eyes. However when I am using and out in public I feel a huge sense of shame. Like every single person knows I am using and as such I feel less than. Like I don't deserve to be out in the sunshine with other people. Even though I contribute positively to society, I hold a full-time job, I am a good friend and family member, I volunteer, I keep myself very well-groomed, etc. So I stay home.
3. I haven't found that I've lost interest in my passions. However I have lost interest in other activities that I did just to fill up time."
1331,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,"I believe it has to do with a lifestyle change. Instead of doing different things, you get stuck in the motions of  copping, using, and worrying about scoring all over again. I’ve experienced this as I’ve noticed when I’m using I might try and make plans but they often fall through because of other things involved with using taking longer than expecting. Then while using you are less likely to do something without being high. Also tend to go around my family less and less."

1346,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,"I think it has to do with totally re-wiring our brains, mainly the reward system that is usually run on auto pilot.  
     We crave good food bc our brains know we need nutrients and when we eat, various neurotransmitters are released that make us feel good, and program us to repeat whatever triggered it.   Whether sex, food , exercise, learning something and applying it to life, such as completing a big job at work and getting a raise... the list goes on.   I’m not sure but I believe endorphins are what fits into the opiate receptors, or pleasure receptors.    Sex is the strongest example, IME, ( I used to revolve my life around girls and getting laid ) but after a while, a big shot of dope is way more appealing than a role in the sheets.    The amount of pleasure felt from external chemicals is many many times higher than can be produced  any internal , natural, organic activity we could imagine.  Including sex, food, etc.   
      Plus the more we replace natural endorphins that are released when we fuck or exercise, with synthetic external ones like morphine- the less natural ones our bodies even produce.

      Next time, I didn’t even think about making plans.  ( except the planning of scoring some opiates, procuring syringes, and a place where I’d have privacy and maybe a tv-  and not long after that; even the TV wasn’t important.  ) 
          So that’s how I became a total recluse.     I also wasn’t a big people person to begin with.  If I didn’t have severe social anxiety, I doubt I’d ever got so into opiates to begin with.

  I'm a firm believer in if you do these hard drugs long enough that it can suppress your natural pleasure center for life"

Share your shit, and also seeing people
Involves doing shit & I hate doing shit unless I have to & even then it’s hard to Get me to do it. lol

 I do that just fine on my own"

      They did bring in therapy dogs though.   It was my favorite activity...   I’m sure if I had a pup to curl up with it’d be a comfort when dealing w cravings.   It’d probably be difficult for me to walk him, feed him while in intense WD tho."
1361,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,Addiction kills the motivation signal in the brain
1362,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,"I truly think that it is because we lose contact with our friends that drink after opiates replace alcohol, and our “normal” friends catch wind of our problem; so they’re better than us now. After they’re gone, we realize that our junkie compadres are all pieces of shit and we don’t want to share with anyone; especially because they sure as hell aren’t going to share with us.

Of course empty stomach = stronger effects/rush but would result in less duration of a high"

Was great when the high started to kick in.

My best ever high was when I first started, got my codeine and tramadol script. Booted up Team Fortress Classic and I was so high I was playing worse rather than better.

Otherwise, the shot itself is fucking weird. It’s a gelatinous ball of shit in your ass cheek. It’s sore for a few days, it also completely fucks with your ability to get drunk for some reason. I could drink all night and get a little uncoordinated but no other sensation aside from that, total mental clarity.

I told that to my dr and he said that suicidal thoughts weren’t a side effect, even though i’ve read from multiple sources that they are. It felt like they were really pushing it and ignoring the concerns i had, gave me a bad feeling. I’m probably gonna stick with the subs until i get a bit further in my recovery"
1400,Subs to vivitrol?,update ? no one probably cares but i got an appointment for tomorrow with a different sub doc so i will not be in agony for weeks :) i wish i didn’t need the subs but life has been tuff lately. stay safe out there family i love u all
1401,Subs to vivitrol?,Vivitrol will keep you from feeling any opiates.. including your own endogenous ones. I wouldn't recommend getting that shot until you've been clear of all suboxone for at least a month..
1402,Subs to vivitrol?,Ive been taken the vivitrol shot for ten months nd never had a side affect accept alil soreness..nothin serious at all..i started wit real oc80s nd 10 millie percocets no generics shit haha but did that for few years nd then went to blue guys for like 7-8 years nd eventually bc of money i turned them stamps/ecp...i can finally say im off all that shit for 10 months...i started wit subs but only took them for a month bc eventually ul become dependent on that nd that withdrawl suckss!! but i been blazn everyday for 20 years nd still do plus dabbn nd edibles now..so il never say im clean but im herron nd blue free haaa..plus ucan get gabapentin nd trazadone for help too while ur takn the shot
1403,Subs to vivitrol?,"I have nightmares of doing this.  One of my old doctors pitched the idea of switching to the vivitrol shot and I got the cold hot sweats sitting in his office just thinking about it.

1409,I would still disagree with that. Depending on dosage they can be just as bad.,"I'm just going off what I've heard, taking large amounts would most likely make the withdrawals worse, that's believable."
1410,"They're milder than say Oxycodone, Morphine, Heroin, Dilaudid, and Opana. That's the point I was trying to make.",Over an ounce a day of kratom has bad withdrawal.
1411,This is dangerous. Kratom withdrawals are brutal. Head over to r/quittingkratom if you are interested.,"I'm IV H user and agree kratom is addictive and has withdrawals. I guess H is worse, but they still suck."
1412,This is dangerous. Kratom withdrawals are brutal. Head over to r/quittingkratom if you are interested.,"I beg to differ. I took it for a year and a half about 20g every day and when I quit my withdrawals lasted for about 3 days, anxiety subsided after about a week. It felt like a mild flu. Which is to say I was blowing my nose a lot and felt really weak and was having cold sweats, but I wouldn't be scared to go through it again. I quit on a weekend so I just chilled out and rode it out.

It really depends on the person but from what I've seen and heard from other people this is the general consensus. 'Brutal' is a bit overkill.

Edit: Dosage is very important too. I think most people that use Kratom are moderate to light users. Everyone I know with the exception of one person all use about 2-4g doses at a time. There's obviously a very big difference between the W/D of someone who uses multiple 8g doses a day and someone who uses it the way me and the aforementioned people do. Just like there's a big difference in withdrawals between someone who's addicted to caffeine who drinks 2-3 cups of coffee everyday and someone who drinks 5 cans of Monster or Redbull everyday. To go out and say the withdrawals are brutal would be to scare the vast majority of new users into believing their withdrawal symptoms are much worse than they really are, nocebos and placebos are two very real phenomenons."
1413,I don't know who to ask... Is kratom addictive to ppl naive to opiates?,"I used kratom daily at really high doses for 3.5 years. The WD's were a shit show. That being said, they are pretty damn mild if you haven't been using it that long. But the problem is kratom does something to serotonin levels as well as opiate like effects so coming off long term use can feel like coming off hydro and an SSRI at the same time. I ended up needing low dose subs to kick kratom."
1414,I don't know who to ask... Is kratom addictive to ppl naive to opiates?,"I read that it is and can be. But for me red Bali never did anything? I tried taking 7gs then 8 up to 10 and still had all WD symptoms, so with that being said I think it’s different for everyone?"
1415,I don't know who to ask... Is kratom addictive to ppl naive to opiates?,"If they are using it to escape reality and cope with life, it can definitely escalate to something else. If they’re using it for health benefits and responsibly, they’re probably good."
1416,I don't know who to ask... Is kratom addictive to ppl naive to opiates?,It can become addictive like anything else. I started taking kratom to substitute my oxy habit. I’m no longer taking oxy but take the kratom twice a day. Does it curb the want for opiates? Sure a little. My situation is I cant get a hold of anything other than kratom so it isn’t really an issue but I would if I could. I can’t speak for taking kratom and never doing opiates but to want something other than kratom is a possibility. Really depends if the person you know has access to other opiates.
1417,Best recreational suboxone dose?,"Its not very recreational.  Its a partial agonist. As such, unless you have a codeine tolerance or perhaps even low level hydros to no tolerance at all, bupe will do nothing but make you sick.


You MUST start with microdoses, if you do choose to continue. I am talking like, less than 1mg at a time. You could end up barfing your brains out with a headache so bad that you wish you'd cut your head off, if you do too much."
1418,Best recreational suboxone dose?,Recreational use would probably be 1-2mg for someone without a tolerance. The felling effect is for 16-24mg but that should only be used in the first couple days of intense WDs.

When I’m taking subs I don’t generally feel much of a “high” myself but I’ve used other opiates far more than I should. So the effects for myself are probably different from yours. But you could try taking 12mg or 16mg if you are actually experiencing a high from them. The FDA approves up 24mg a day just not all at once. But I have dropped 3 8mg strips at once before because I thought I was going to be arrested, had an accident while license was suspended and quickly took what I had on my person. I definitely noticed a difference that day for sure too so I know the higher doses do make a difference."

I do like them, I just never had much access until recently, but I actually started on subs, except the occasional oxy here and there, rarely. So when I started them, It definitely got me high. By high, I mean altered feeling, physically and mentally. So pretty much it makes me just feel happier, have a better outlook on pretty much everything, and almost gives me a stimulant type feeling? Lots of energy, and waves of euphoria here and there. By the end of the day, depending on how much I did, Ill have a nod and it's easy to sleep.

Actually, in the past month, I decided to give heroin a try as well, so I stopped the subs for a day then railed and smoked some. It was fucking intense, the nod was verryyy intense and so was the euphoria. I felt very content with either being awake, or asleep, maybe you know the feeling. It was like sub x10, except without the stimulant feeling. I decided H is too dangerous/expensive/illegal to create a habit, so I stopped for a bit and switched back to subs. They're super cheap, make me feel so good (don't get nausea either), and I can function 100%. Definitely my DOC"

After you describing how things feel I share the same thoughts with you. The subs make me feel as normal as could be and definitely a little more up beat that if I was completely sober. The only difference is when experiencing WDs from something else the subs don’t have as much of an uplifting effect as it’s more of a sobering feeling put a relief from the other symptoms I have going on. Just be careful because you are gonna need to taper down to hop off of the subs whenever you decide you’re ready to go back sober because you will experience some WDs from them.
1423,Best recreational suboxone dose?,"If you have no tolerance then you probably won't want to do more than 1mg. Really .25 or .5mg would be better starting doses, and if it's your first time ever then definitely take .25mg just in case.

Everyone is different, you might be sensitive to it or it might barely effect you. Like the other poster said it's not the most recreational of opiates due to the way it works, but it is a strong opiate in the sense that very little will have a strong effect, comparatively. Also bupe tend to have more nausea than other opiates, which are already notorious for nausea to begin with, so going too high will likely make you feel quite sick which isn't very fun.

You can always take more but you can never take less."

Pretty much washes straight through to your throat.

1454,"Can anyone here please explain the difference in high between Oxy, Hydromorphone and Morphine?","Morphine is what I would call a deep high. It has a lot of euphoria, and the rush, but also is less potent than oxy and Hydromorphone. Oxy is less of a deep, heavy high, it's lighter in my opinion, and better overall for pain.

But yes he is still alive and never had any signs of OD... if it was too much then he’d throw up and slowly start feeling better... then take another 1 or more. When I first started seeing him he took 5 at one time and I was terrified... called his mom and she was like “nah he’s okay, that’s normal so you better get used to it”. And like I said early on I jumped on the bandwagon because it was very hard to avoid it.

It took him a few months to adjust to such a lower dose ... a lot of chasing pills with liquor. It got really bad but honestly it was way worse before.

1557,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"Well one, she's not an addict. An addict is someone who takes something everyday (psychological addiction), and with opiates it's not only everyday but they also go in WDs if they don't have it (physiological addiction). She has neither so is not an addict.

This is identical to the difference between an alcoholic vs someone who drinks on the weekends. Or the difference between a pot head vs someone who smokes at parties. Or the difference between a crack head vs someone who does lines every weekend with their friends.

Once a week use of most every comminly used drug is completely compatible with a functional life. She is not addicted. Once a week use has no major impact like daily use does.

The only danger I'd see her in is eventually ramping up to daily use. But if she's sufficiently scared of addiction and has self control then she could probably do this forever with no real consequences."
1558,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,I shove about 15mg of oxy in my nose once or twice a month. Having no tolerance and getting the same insane high seems like where it’s at. I’ve got too much other shit I enjoy doing.

Because everyone that says they have their addiction under control, is just subsiding from the actual problem. Well not necessarily but in my case anyways. For me I had a weird past when I was young. Starting off smoking oxy80’s when I was 18 10 years ago... you know when you could get 10 for 280-350$?? I was living with a friend and his mom straight up caught me chasing the dragon, didn’t knock on the door for the first time. She basically said you’re don’t or you’re out. I had no where to go at that point and was terrified of being homeless without a job at so young. I only stayed clean for a few months got right back into but was living with my mom at the time. I forgot how she caught me I honestly think my friends mom called me mom and told her? Idk but anyways I already couldn’t go back to my friends and my mom said treatment or the streets. So I said treatment it is. 1 year inpatient at a faith based treatment company. But I didn’t want it and once I got out I relapsed again, next time was drug court. This one actually worked for some reason. Stayed clean for 6.5 years after 1 year of random UA’s and 3 meetings a week. I stopped all meetings afterwards and did well on my own, saved money got married paid $xx,000 for the honey moon out of our own wallets!

Straight into the blues k/9s strictly, and when that person left state the only other option which just so happened to be cheaper was H... ok so that’s the backstory. Here’s how I functioned:

I always had my rent paid first no matter what, I could find something to sell or someone to borrow money from. Also me and my buddy had alternating pay checks so he would help me out and I would help him out we constantly had money and got lucky with the pay of our jobs. But don’t get me wrong, within the first year I called out probably 20 times and luckily didn’t get fired, that’s what you do when you’re sick and work a manual labor job... everything’s good always have money always have bills paid, I can do this forever!! Then all of a sudden you realize you’re getting cheap H and want the better stuff! But I only know this one girl... and fuck was she stingy. To the point she would tell all her 10-15 different people to not deal with my buddy and I because we are “shady”... pfft cool thanks lady... so anyways I would pay 10$ And get randomly sometimes good mostly bunk and told her I need the good stuff every time, I knew she always had the good stuff I knew she could so now it’s 20$ a point... but It was constantly fire! But guess what now I don’t have so much money anymore and I can’t go back to bunk.. so now why not get rid of TV we still have internet can do basically everything with it. Boom now we don’t need internet because we can use the free xfinity WiFi !! Woohoo good to go again couple extra hundred bucks a month. But now my tolerance has gone up and I need to spend 50-70$ a day... so now I just start not paying bills until the last minute to have as much extra cash as I can. Hey! I have checks I wonder if I can pay rent woth a check, pull my money out and let it negative my account, it’s like a 35$ loan for 4-5 days he’ll yes!! Back in it... nope 👎🏼. It’s just keeps getting worse and worse until you have no other option but to start selling your shit, stealing from others and finding any means to get that cash so you can function. You can’t lose your job, you’ll lose your roof... and I can’t lose my roof I just can’t. I just moved an hour away from everything, no transportation, blocked and deleted all numbers that I could see being an issue. I’m on day 6 now. Thanks for reading!"
1565,"This is a good thread. Because everyone that says they have their addiction under control, is just subsiding from the actual problem. Well not necessarily but in my case anyways. For me I had a weird past when I was young. Starting off smoking oxy80’s when I was 18 10 years ago... you know when you could get 10 for 280-350$?? I was living with a friend and his mom straight up caught me chasing the dragon, didn’t knock on the door for the first time. She basically said you’re don’t or you’re out. I had no where to go at that point and was terrified of being homeless without a job at so young. I only stayed clean for a few months got right back into but was living with my mom at the time. I forgot how she caught me I honestly think my friends mom called me mom and told her? Idk but anyways I already couldn’t go back to my friends and my mom said treatment or the streets. So I said treatment it is. 1 year inpatient at a faith based treatment company. But I didn’t want it and once I got out I relapsed again, next time was drug court. This one actually worked for some reason. Stayed clean for 6.5 years after 1 year of random UA’s and 3 meetings a week. I stopped all meetings afterwards and did well on my own, saved money got married paid $xx,000 for the honey moon out of our own wallets!

1567,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"Being a functioning addict merely means that the *addiction* doesn't interfere too much with a productive life. 

Some people might disagree but IMHO ""having it under control"" in context with opiates is almost always a delusional claim. Give it long enough time and at some point, sometimes after weeks, maybe after years that person will likely lose eventually control. 

There seem to be exceptions to that but those lucky few also have yet to hit the sack without failing."
1568,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"Yeah it’s possible, that was me for about 18 months. But all it takes is one crisis to push you into taking it more. Then it gets its hooks in you and you’re an addict."

Then it became every saturday and I started to look forward to it.

Then if I had a stressful day at work I'd have some after work.  This quickly became every day  and all of a sudden I wasn't getting high any more merely a mild buzz,  So I switched to a harder opiate and the cycle went on."

Then that leads to taking one every single time you have a bad day. With the excuse “eh, a few days in a row won’t hurt” then BOOM! You find an any excuse to take one. “I spilled mustard on my shirt. I need a damn pill” LOL"

Now back at home with mum n dad"
1573,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,I only use opiates one or two days a month and have for 6years and counting. I have tried most opiates from codeine/lean to oxy/heroin and IVing. Longest period of use is around 4 days once and my preferred ROI is either pill or snort. Some months I just don't use it. I really like the effects of opiates but if I dose too soon again it is no where near the same as the first dose. When I use I usually will take 120mg oxy or buy a quarter G of heroin. I have never been physically dependant.
1574,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"There are always going to be people that are ""chipping"". They don't always become full blown addicts.

I still think it'd be better if your friend found a better way to unwind. I mean using opiates is always a slippery slope. It can get scary out of nowhere. So keep an eye on her.

1579,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"I'm the closest thing you'll find to a functioning addict. 

I have a six-figure job at the top of my field. I live in a nice apartment and am relatively in-shape. I've dated some wonderful ladies in the last year. None of them worked out long-term, but for no reasons related to the drugs.

My coworkers know I take a lot of pills, but I'm good-natured at work and my performance is stellar, so they are more likely to joke about it than be legitimately concerned for my health.

I took opiates for the first time 8 years ago as a result of a jaw surgery. I was sucker-punched in an attempted robbery. Since then, I haven't gone more the 3 months clean, and that was only a couple times. I only take prescription pills that I buy on the black market. At this point, I'm very confident in my ability to sniff out fake pills and I never take something if I'm not convinced it's the real thing. I recently saved my current dealer from a bad deal by informing him that the lot of M30s we was going to buy were almost certainly fake (he later found out I was correct).

The most valuable thing I've lost is time. I've spent tens of thousands of dollars on pills and I've wasted literal years of my life in a foggy stupor. I used to be a vibrant wide-eyed, hungry young man with a lust for traveling, reading, competition, meeting people, and experiencing everything the world had to offer. I had opportunities very few people are lucky enough to receive.

Now I'm a perpetually tired and depressed working class man who just can't wait to get home, ice my swollen feet and pop some percs. No matter how sweetly the song-birds twitter or how brightly the sun shines, nothing seems beautiful to me anymore.

That's the best you can hope for if you take opiates every day. For whatever genetic reason, I don't have to genes to predispose me to severe addiction. I'm not sucking dicks under the bridge for my next fix. But I've condemned myself to a slow, withering death instead."

1581,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,uh no. not with 20mg oxys. She would nod tf out because of constantly keeping a low tolerance and probably fall in love with it. who knows though . could be too distracted with work to indulge in that habit.

1584,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"I am a functioning addict. I get up and go to work and come home and help cook and clean and raise the kids and pay the mortgage and vote and clean gutters... and I’m secretly tapering down a years-long Subutex addiction. I snort tiny amounts a few times a day to get a little euphoria and to keep the monkey happily purring. 

I have no illusions that I have it “under control” though. One misstep and It’s the abyss for me. Just a few more weeks of taper... then just maybe..."
1585,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"It is possible. I used this way for years with my own scripts and then after those were out only on weekends or one weekday. 

But then years passed and it went from that to 4 times a week. Then 5. Then any day I had money and if I didn't sometimes I could front. Then it wasn't enough and had to spend damn near $100 per person for me and my husband to feel anything. Then stupidly switched. So while it is possible, it's a very slippery slope. Imo once you go 3 days straight you're fucked. 

If she doesn't think she has a problem though then anything you say will fall on deaf ears. She won't know until it's too late, and won't stop until she's finally done herself. Just try and be there for her when she decides enough is enough."
1586,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"Now? Yes. It took me several years to get to this point though 

 I'm on 4-6mg subutex per day (IV) which I've been 100% compliant/accountable for over the past year and a half (legitimately piss clean, got 200+ saved up, dont sell  any, do maintenance work for my Dr under the table, etc.) 

I dont smoke weed or drink, but I still  do meth every couple weeks. About .2 over the course of a weekend, 1 shot per day. I can be productive in this kind of amount, but I specifically dont do it for any reason other than fun. 
 Dont really have a bad comedown,  it just kinda wears off and then I fall asleep. (Due to the fact I dont constantly redose like ppl who smoke it) 

Theres very little actual consequence, especially when I'm not paying $20 for a whole weekend of  enjoyment. In that sense,  i feel like I have a hard time finding a reason not to, since I have been on the other side of it too

1587,Everyone always references “ba” for oral morphine etc. What does that stand for / mean?,"Bioavailability is the amount of drug that is actually usable to your body.  When you eat morphine, your stomach can absorb way less of the morphine than if you were to inject it.  Therefore you’d get way higher from 15mg injected vs 15mg eaten"

1589,Everyone always references “ba” for oral morphine etc. What does that stand for / mean?,Yea oral morphine BA is terrible.  Only thing it’s remotely good for imo is bridging to lower your tolerance from higher strength opis.

1612,How fucked am I?,Better to stop now that at day 7-8. You’ll hVe minimal withdrawal symptoms and they should be manageable.
1613,How fucked am I?,"It'll definitely be manageable. I had a really similar situation. I had 9 months sober, went on a 5 day bender, and now I have 40 days again. I felt kinda shitty on day 2, but like I said, it was definitely manageable. 

Keep at it bro."
1614,How fucked am I?,"Depends on a few things. How long ago you first started using, your metabolism, how much you used during your mini bender, how strong was the shit, ect.

Overall, it probably won't be the worst. But try to get some subs, kratom, weed, xanax, clonidine, even lope (worst case scenario) if you have too. Any of those would help a bunch. I know it sucks. But try to tough it out and just know you never have to go through that again, if you don't want too."
1615,How fucked am I?,I’m in same boat except mine was like 9-10 days and I just got some Kratom and I’m fine
1616,How fucked am I?,For me if i use for 3 days in a row im back to square 1.  Doesn't matter if im a month or a year clean. 1 day using and i just sleep most of the next day then im fine. 2 days and i get mild wds for a day or two. 3 days and im doin fat shots and wake up dope sick.
1617,What's your best or worst story about cold copping?,"My best experience with cold copping was when someone I don't really know told me where a good dope spot is, and I went there, and I just told the corner boys what I needed, and they took my money and gave it to a guy in a house across the street, and then got me a bundle of their shit, and it was absolutely fire, and the bags are nicks but they're fatter than most dime bags from what I hear, and feel like they have minimal to no fent in em. It's a low-key spot so cops don't usually patrol the block a lot like other more popular blocks."
1618,What's your best or worst story about cold copping?,"My brother in law once was driving back from picking up. A car pulled up and legit tossed a half a g into his window wrapped in notebook paper with a phone number on it. He called the dude later and the guy was all sketched out as if he didn't randomly throw dope into a stranger's car hours earlier lmao. He mistook my BiL for someone else I guess? 

My husband tried to cold cop 14 months ago, a year ago today he entered rehab. Dude gave him like legit tar. Like from the street lmao. Then called my husband like 3x to see if he wanted coke. Like no wtf? I was super pregnant at the time and pissed off he was using again anyway, let alone the fact he wasted $20 on street dirt. I don't think he ever tried after that since he's super shy."

1636,Levels of fentanyl?,Have u done H before? How hard is it to find oxys out there or other pharma

I done h yes. But currently i cant seem to find it round"
1638,"No oxys we only sell codeine and tram in liban

1639,Codeine is wayyyy better than tramadol.  Tramadol is literal trash.  If you switch from tramdol to fent you gonna die,True  idk baby doses bro. If u know anyone on empire that slangs h ww lmk
1640,True  idk baby doses bro. If u know anyone on empire that slangs h ww lmk,Did you check the European vendors? They’re much more likely to than US vendors.
1641,Did you check the European vendors? They’re much more likely to than US vendors.,Nevermind i just ordered level 2 fent. Gonna keep narcan on stanby once i finally shoot it up.

1643,Can you tell when you take a pressed pill vs regular?,"They make a die for every abusable pharm there is, literally. Anything can be pressed. Cameras don't depict color, depth, or enough detail to even be mostly sure sometimes, it is highly irresponsible to trust your life with strangers on the internet. You should assume that these are pressed, regardless of what people say here, and dose accordingly.

We don't allow fake pill ID posts anymore. [Here is the rule from the sidebar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/wiki/rules#wiki_13.29_posts_requesting_pill_id_or_press_inquiries_are_not_permitted.)

1644,Can you tell when you take a pressed pill vs regular?,I can tell because my hands go numb and my legs feel like they don't exist anymore. It sends me straight into a panic attack every single time
1645,Can you tell when you take a pressed pill vs regular?,"A very well made one you wouldn’t really notice the difference. There’s not really a market for oxy where I live though but the Xanax is often just etizolam mixed with fentanyl. Those things look and break like the pharmacy ones I had the first time.

 So texture and shape are out of the question unless it’s really bad (like crumbles and is spotted). Unless you know the difference between oxy and fentanyl (like duration and maybe effect too. Oxy lasts 6 hours but it seems fentanyl is only 2 “when placed in mouth”). I don’t see how a human could determine this without testing on themselves without a fentanyl test (very cheap). 

Ps do you know if the fake 30’s are always just fentanyl because if they are a mix of both duration wouldn’t matter."

Got fentanyl/heroin (I think I even paid more for that sample) then smoked the whole bag in 2 nights of heavy smoking when normally the same amount of (I think relatively high purity) heroin had lasted a week or two. Smoking it I got some of my best highs in my life but would throw up and black out like every hour. 

That could just be because there was a little bit of heroin and I was just smoking more than I normally would’ve in addition to fentanyl. Didn’t know it had fentanyl until I had finished it and the friend who bought it told me it tested. And people with the patch have said that it’s just hours of bliss."

1654,My buddy with a lower tolerance ODd off half last night and is bringing it over to me to test with fent strips.,"OD'd on half a 30? Wonder what the results will be 🤔🤔🤔




Edit: Oh and Id make a volumetric solution with the assumption it's 50% pure fent and work your way up with boofed doses. 



I.e. if the pill piece weighs 100mg, then dissolve it in water with the assumption its 50mg of fentanyl. 


100mL water=.5mg/mL, a starting dose of fent for you would be maybe .1, so boof a fifth of a mililiter and then adjust accordingly. 



Be sure to A- make sure fent is water soluble (90% sure it is, but not actually positive) and B- put the sealed bottle of fent-water in a tub of warm water for a little while and shake it really well before each use



If you really wanna be safe, assume the pill is 100% fent. Or even 100% carfent


Oh and it most likely contains less than a couple miligrams so youll have to end up taking way more than a fifth of a mL. But better safe than sorry."

But I would buy test strips to be safe. Tar is pretty easy to tell if real or not. It should smell like vinegar and taste bitter. (I know its sounds weird but if you lick it you can usually tell because its bitter as fuck.) West coast tar is usually WAY safer than fent 30s. I've been using tar for over a year now and only got fetty in my tar 4 or 5 times.  The problem with fent 30s is you dont know how much is in them. Sometimes they're bunk other times they're way too strong. With your tolerance I would stay far away from fent 30s.

1709,Any tips on how to smoke fent 30’s off foil? I been snorting them for a while. Any advice would be nice.,"I get a way better high off of snorting these, I find smoking them just doesn’t get me as high and the length of the high is shorter. But yeah just practice lol, if you’re finding that you’re losing a lot of smoke I used to pinch the ends of the tin together and create a sort of cup in which you put the straw in, the smoke is more contained."
1710,Just curious I have experimented with little coke mixing with roxy usually about 80 to 100 mg? I would do a couple lines and feel fucking amazing like a Yeager bomb times 10?

1714,How quickly do Heroin overdoses after using?,When i went it was about 3min after my shot. I remember pushing it in and thats it tho.
1715,When i went it was about 3min after my shot. I remember pushing it in and thats it tho.,This was fent.
1716,How quickly do Heroin overdoses after using?,I snorted 30mg of fent on accident and passed out unconscious unable to breathe within 10-30 seconds. thank god my dad knew cpr and an ambulance came with 2 shots of narcan for my ass. Lmao

1719,How quickly do Heroin overdoses after using?,"Instantly to a few minutes at tops, in my experience."
1720,How quickly do Heroin overdoses after using?,"Depends on just how hard they OD'd and ROA.

Smoking hits you really quick, but is hard to OD on because you have to take it one hit at a time. Snorting starts hitting you in about 5 minutes and is fully kicked in by 30 minutes, so it could be anywhere from 5 to 30 depending on just how much you took, more drug=less time

Shooting, less than 5 minutes regardless of dosage. Instantly if it was way too much.

I hope this helps."
1721,How quickly do Heroin overdoses after using?,"I have OD'd right away from IV use and after about 30 minutes with nasal use. It depends on the strength of the dope, the ROA, and if you have anything else in your system. It is different for everyone I'd think."
1722,For months clean? Should I still feel like this?,Maybe the reason you only feel better after taking your Gaba It’s because you feel nasty due to gaba  withdrawls if you’re not on a high enough dose
1723,For months clean? Should I still feel like this?,"5-htp, l-theanine, l-tyrosine.  That combo is supposed to be a good combo of supplements to take for opiate withdrawal after the initial effects subside.  I am not sure any of these will really help you with the physical symptoms though, more to help the brain heal from it."
1724,For months clean? Should I still feel like this?,there is no way you should still be having withdrawal symptoms after that length of time. The fact that gaba helps leads me to believe you may have an underlying condition.
1725,For months clean? Should I still feel like this?,"You do know that you can get pretty nasty withdrawals from gabapentin, right?"
1726,For months clean? Should I still feel like this?,GABA wds my guy they are pretty bad as well.

1736,"I feel mild withdraw symptoms while on suboxone, is this normal?","It may just take a couple of days for the sub to build up in your system before you feel completely normal. 

When I first got on subs I still felt like I was in minor withdrawal for the entire first day and a good portion of the 2nd if I remember correctly. This was switching over from 1-1.5 g’s of BTH per day. However, the further from my last use I got the better I felt. 

These days I jump back and forth so much that the subs will hardly touch my withdrawals. Last time I tried to switch over I took 24 mg’s throughout the day and was still sick AF. Ended up buying more fucking heroin because I couldn’t ride it out lmao"

IV is the only real way to get the max out of dills but I would strongly advise against that unless you are already shooting. The love from the needle is a addiction by its self."
1755,Why does dilaudid suck for me?,Its because your tolerance is very low and honestly it's quite a unique substance and can affect histamine levels intensely
1756,Why so hard to Stay Off opiates?,I think its all individual. Some people come back 100 percent while some don't. I think our environment and lives have a lot to do with it. For instance if youre homeless or have always been depressed then it may be harder to enjoy sober life with nithing to look forward too. But if youre a successful person with a good job and family.. When you get clean you may truly enjoy it and have motivation because there is morr to enjoy. It's also important to try and progress when you're clean. My problem was id be clean for a couple months but still just sat at home all day doing nothing on my phone ans was depressed. We have to push our comfort zone and get out! Thats how oppotunities come and things can change in your life. Best of luck bro

I’m not sure about toroxycon as I’ve heard conflicted reports about them gelling up (maybe there’s two different formulas?) but most people say they’re the same as the sandoz brand.

Bulk (a box of 28 or more) it was only £10 per 80, so maybe ask about bulk prices too? But for that price I’d totally pick up one or two just to test out.

Also, ever tried kava? It's pricey but may be helpful for you to use every so often. Supposedly it increases GABA receptor density (GABA helps the nerves to relax) and supposedly isn't physically addictive like benzodiazepines are.

I think I'll get some naltrexone and start with 0.5-1mg. Its use in treatment of opiate addiction and alcoholism is enough for me to try it out.

SSRIs are garbage drugs that only help a minority of people; and people are constantly forgetting or are simply unaware that there are other antidepressants available out there as well. The fact that you prefer the more stimulating opioids like tramadol, tapentadol and oxycodone with tramadol and tapentadol being very strong noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors could mean that you have a problem with low noradrenaline and dopamine. Just a gut feeling but your uneasiness and preference for the stimulating opioids could be symptoms of having ADHD.

You should look into more stimulating ADs like Wellbutrin, Nortriptyline and MAOIs - and also have a psychiatrist screen you for ADHD which could give you scripts of stimulants to try as well. All these medicines will boost your natural endogenous opioid production as the monoamine system is heavily interlinked with the opioid one. If you still have cravings for opioids you could combine your AD with maybe suboxone or kratom. Oh and by the way, kratom is a great replacement for those dirty acting shit drugs tramadol and tapentadol. Unlike tramadol and tapentadol kratom can also be combined with any antidepressant including MAOIs. Probably want to avoid taking SSRIs/SNRIs/strong SRI drugs for your problems and if you already found no relief from SSRIs.

But yes I do believe that in some people there definitely is an endogenous opioid deficiency - these people probably need to be on opioid replacement therapy (ie sub/methadone) for life. If you suffer from anxiety and depression other antidepressants will be helping you as well in combatting these problems and your possible natural opioid deficient state - but some unfortunate few people may still need an opioid of course.

I would want to say though that depressed people in general probably are in a constant low endogenous opioid/endorphinic state, but for some or a lot of these people other antidepressants will raise endogenous opioids through downstream action enough to restore them to normal levels."

Appreciate the in-depth response.

I have often wondered recently if I do in fact have ADHD. I took amphetamine once, and I could definitely focus and do things better and felt more content, but the physical tension/unease issue I have wasn't really helped, if not worsened. I am generally sensitive to stimulants and avoid them. But don't really fully remember the amphetamine experience since it was so long ago. Also don't know exactly the dose I took, so you may have a point there.

I think I'm more likely to be aspergers. It's hard to get an actual real diagnosis where I live. I just know that SOMETHING is off and I've started self-medicating to get relief. I have no reason to be how I am, other than some mental deficiency. I didn't have that bad a childhood, get abused or bullied, or anything like that. Just have anxiety and some related depression. The anxiety is worse and really wears me down to a point of almost constant fatigue and irritability.

Do you think I should ask my doc about tianeptine? That's a tri-cyclic antidepressant and opioid agonist. I actually tried Amitriptyline (a TCA) a few times, but the constipation was horrible, so doubt I would do well on tianeptine unless I did some anti-constipation protocol, too."

Well yes, not everyone with ADHD responds well to amphetamines or other stimulants but usually they can find something that helps. Also if you have no idea what dose you took or even the quality of the shit you were taking then that doesn't really say much either. If it was some powder it could have been anything really, like some dirty rc, and racemic street amphetamines can be quite different from pure dextroamphetamine in terms of potential side-effects.

>I think I'm more likely to be aspergers. It's hard to get an actual real diagnosis where I live. I just know that SOMETHING is off and I've started self-medicating to get relief.

Well you could be all three, or four of those: Asperger with comorbid depression, anxiety and ADHD. The combo of Asperger or autism with ADHD is extremely common. Depression too.

>Do you think I should ask my doc about tianeptine? That's a tri-cyclic antidepressant and opioid agonist. I actually tried Amitriptyline (a TCA) a few times, but the constipation was horrible, so doubt I would do well on tianeptine unless I did some anti-constipation protocol, too.

Maybe, if you won't abuse it. Tianeptine is technically a TCA but their effects are nothing alike!! Tianeptine lacks anticholinergic and adrenergic properties - so it most likely will not cause constipation. As for a comparison, when I tried tianeptine at 50 mg daily, I actually had increased bowel movements!

This may seem a little extreme but you may maybe want to look into MAOIs also. Moclobemide could be a good alternative and you usually don't have to follow any dietary restrictions on it, though probably don't want to eat tyramine rich foods in excess. You can combine Moclobemide or any other MAOI for that matter with both tianeptine and for example bupropion."

1843, So what happened to the dealer? Is he sitting out junkie but still selling or in prison?,"No, he’s buying subs with me, still selling a few pills here and there. We’re both just kind of over the rat race of pills and H."
1844,"No, he’s buying subs with me, still selling a few pills here and there. We’re both just kind of over the rat race of pills and H.","   Ugh yeah, a life of pills and H isn't much of a life..constant grind ..."
1845,"   Ugh yeah, a life of pills and H isn't much of a life..constant grind ...",It is indeed and I’m just gettin too old for it.
1846,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,I just stay cool calm and collective like with any business transaction. Never had any problems.
1847,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,"So, currently i have several plugs in the large city about an hour away. Most of them are sketch, either inconsistent in their quality, or they make me feel unsafe as to how we meet.
One guy tho, he is always super efficent in how we meet, is timely to the min and meets me right at the edge of the hood and the ""white"" area. makes me feel safe.
For a while, his number was suddenly answered by his cousin, who would make me meet him in the worst part of the hood. but then a couple weeks ago the og guy was back! told me he was tryin to let his cousin make some $$, but he was scarin custies off lol.

Now recently, i havent been able to go down, cause my buddy faded out and wrecked my car on the way back from coppin. He hit me up askin why he hadnt heard from me in a bit, and when i told him, he told me he would deliver! to a tiny town, an hour away! unheard of in my circles. I also used to grab some rocks when i was in the city from a dif guy, and when i asked him, he told me he could being me that too, and raw or caps. good guy. :)

This is since i moved back to the midwest. when i lived in the rocky mountain state, i got that wonderful cartel tar from a good friend, who would let me walk into his house unannounced, weigh out my own shit, and leave money on the table. true homie, would float me, deliver to work... he took care of me. I miss him since i moved, but im happy to say he is clean now after 18 years deep in the game.
/endramble"
1848,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,"My plug is seriously amazing. So much so when I tell people how great he is they don't believe me lol! We started as friends before he became my plug. As such he knows a lot about me personally. He checks up on me when he knows I've been sick or going through something. 

He always answers me immediately. The only time he's ever taken time to respond is when he is in an appointment. Not only does he answer quickly, he responds in full sentences that actually make sense. He keeps regular ""business hours"" so I can easily plan around his availability. 

He is extremely honest with what he is selling to me (pressed pills). When he gets different batches he always explains everything to me (price difference, if there are deals available, why certain batches cost more than others, etc.). 

He is super easy to meet and I can tell he is hyper-vigilant about his surroundings, just like I am. He's just an awesome person all around."
1849,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,Great with all them. Its a mutual relationship i got stuff they need and they got stuff i need so we are always kickin it and shooting the shit
1850,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,"I don’t use anymore but mine was and still is a good friend.  I had another plug and he was cool too, but had a family and didn’t hang out much.  Both of my old plugs would take the money from my car and leave the pills why I was at work.  Super easy!!"
1851,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,"He's dead, so not so great."
1852,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,One of them is hella cool and the other makes you wait for an hour minimum pretty much its wack
1853,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,The postman’s ite I guess😂
1854,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,"My plug and I were really good friends, he was about ten years older than me and sort of fatherly in a way.  He gave me some harm reduction talks in the past, I knew he wouldn’t be selling pills to me if he didn’t need to for income.  He was constantly worried about my health and made sure I didn’t take too much at one time or built my tolerance up too far.  He moved a while ago and is now living with his girlfriend in the midwest, quit benzos and opiates and is living his best life.  This was a big deal, considering he was prescribed the second to highest fentanyl patch strength and got upwards of like 100 roxys a month (he sold most of them tho). I miss the constant supply but I am happy for him.  Hoping Junkie Jesus blesses me soon."
1855,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,"I moved out of state, but my plugs actually still hit me up to check on me and talk.  Had one hit me up for “that white boys number” yesterday, I asked what that made me (I’m white) and he said “my nigga”, so I guess good...pretty solid, lol."
1856,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,Me and my last plug became close friends. Before that I was coping from corner boys or hood cp plugs. Those were just like any other business relationships. We acted like friends during deals because we both had what each other wanted but that was it.
1857,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,"My plug is my best friend.

Not  that my best friend happenes to be my plug, he just became my best friends over time. He fully trust me and I fully trust him. At some point he even started looking into his hiding spot for money while I was there. He know he can trust me.

He doesn't deal h though, but high quality coke and can also get his hand on pretty much anything if I ask him. He's a really good guy. We're planning on tripping on acid this week with my girlfriend."
1858,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,My plugs great. My fiancée and I get free drugs for trading sexual favors. Sounds bad but it’s very good.
1859,Nyquil for sleep during detox?,"It could possibly cause RLS, everybody is different. For me personally when I'm in withdrawal the only thing that puts me to sleep is more opiates sadly. I've tried benadryl, nyquil, seroquel, remeron, ambien, and multiple different benzos but for me personally none of it does the trick. Most of them actually make my RLS worse even after taking something like requip on top of them to combat it. But I know a lot of people that say some of that stuff helps them get at least a couple hours of sleep, especially benzos."
1860,"It could possibly cause RLS, everybody is different. For me personally when I'm in withdrawal the only thing that puts me to sleep is more opiates sadly.

High benzo dose also lets me sleep but I’m on a tight leash with that prescription because of past abuse so I can’t really do it eveytime. Everything else (Bendryl, Nyquill, Nytol etc) gives me RLS in high enough doses for me to sleep. Robaxacet with carbomethamol (spelling?) might work but I wish it didn’t come with Ibuprofen/Acetominophen/Aspirin...! Micro-dose of opiates works but I try to avoid it."
1861,Gout and dope?,that sucks.. i've seen people dealing with gout and its not pleasant looking.  dont jump to gout right away though because there are specific criteria for gout that only a doctor could diagnose.. hopefully its just a one-off situation ya know.  and hope that powder didnt kill your kidneys lol

Ugh
1863,Gout and dope?,"ahhh  , the kings disease."
1864,"ahhh  , the kings disease.","Lol yeah it can1 be a result of too much seafood, red meat, decadent restaurant food and drinking. But I live off chicken and rice and only drink beer. I tell you, I think it was brought on by opiate induced dehydration. Or whatever that fent is cut with"

""too much seafood or red meat""...lol"
1866,Gout and dope?,What does the gout in your foot feel like?
1867,What does the gout in your foot feel like?,"Omg it was horrid. So first my foot felt really stiff like I had a cramp I couldn't shake. Then it turned bright red, got all swollen and hot at the base of the toes! The swelling went down a bit, now it looks like a black and blue mark. Still hurts, too."

1869,"I dont think thats gout... i mean it could be idk what that actually means in all fairness, but I got what yore describing when i was shooting in my feet... do you shoot anywhere under your hips?","Nope, just my arm. It's definitely gout, I've seen it in my patients at work many times. I just never heard of it happening as a result of opiate use."
1870,Opiates and etizolam?,"Yup, I've tried it. I woke up in the middle of a busy street surrounded by paramedics. Definitely not safe especially because Etizolam gives you the delusion of sobriety (you think you're sober even though you're absolutely fucked up)"
1871,Opiates and etizolam?,"Yeah pretty dangerous. I mean benzos are pretty safe on their own, but add them on top of any other CNS/ specifically respiratory system depressant and it can easily turn your lights out for good. That being said I used to be heavy on the opiates and could easily take 2mg of etizolam on top of my dose without any noticeable ill effects. But I wouldn’t recommend it. Opiates were just as fun without etizolam, and all the etizolam did was make me careless enough to do a little too much dope and pass out too early. Just really wouldn’t recommend it man"
1872,Opiates and etizolam?,No fucking way.
1873,Opiates and etizolam?,It can be dangerous when you mix too much.
1874,Opiates and etizolam?,"If you take very small amounts, it's fine. The problem comes with re-dosing and not knowing how prone you are to it. We all lose some self-control when under the influence.

So, not recommended. Just stick to one or the other."
1875,Opiates and etizolam?,NO
1876,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,Shit forever lol how long u been using
1877,Shit forever lol how long u been using,"Fuck man that’s what it seems to be for me. I quit 3 months ago. Tried to get high on prescription roxi for my birthday (not a relapse, just a planned celebratory single dose) and I snorted all 3 of the pills I bought within an hour and still did not feel high. I suppose this is because I used to use fentanyl pressed pills and my tolerance was sky high, coupled with the fact that I’ve been using kratom for maintenance. But still, after 3 months I expected to easily be able to get high with 30-45mg of oxy. But nope, not even 90mg was enough. Crazy how tolerance works. I think it depends a lot of whether you’ve been totally clean or using something for maintenance though."

1880,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,"This is prolly the last thing you wanna hear but I stopped taking oxy for 2 years and tried it again after and needed around 100mg to feel anything which was similar to the dose I was taking before I quit. Idk why but my tolerance I sincerely believe will never return to normal, hope you don’t have the same problem lmfaooo"
1881,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?," Honestly, when I read these tolerance questions regarding opiates, I recommend just getting off and staying off..find another drug class to experiment with as its just not worth the possible trouble..

  Once someone gets addicted or develop tolersnce, it takes several weeks of clean time before opiates regain any sort of magic ..they can still get you high but tolerance will develop at a very fast rate if you start using them with any regularity.."
1882,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,Month
1883,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,"I was doing 150 mg of oxy at once everyday for a couple years. Took 3 months off and 60 mg got me floored.

I’d say a good couple months"
1884,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Depends on tollerenca im sure some would die off of 120 mg
1885,Depends on tollerenca im sure some would die off of 120 mg,I have used alot of tramadol so i think my tollerance would be a bit higher
1886,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,"With no tolerance a 30mg amount will be perfect! Honestly you will get rocked, don’t listen to the people going above this until you gauge for yourself."
1887,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Go slow with it try 40 mg if 25 was weak
1888,Go slow with it try 40 mg if 25 was weak,Never tried oxy so i wondered if 25mg was enough. Also will mixing oxy with other opiates like cosylan and tramadol potentiate it

1890,[deleted],Benadryl is impossible to get here. I have some antihistamines. Is oxy liver toxic? I am on alot of methyl tren now and have to be careful.
1891,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,35 mg of oxy should have u feeling good chew it up and youll be vibing within the hour
1892,35 mg of oxy should have u feeling good chew it up and youll be vibing within the hour,Will i nod out on such a dose?
1893,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Well do youbtake tramodol everyday n how much of it do ubtake
1894,Well do youbtake tramodol everyday n how much of it do ubtake,Not everyday but i have had binges and i take it whenever it is avaible. I have to take about 500mg staggered to get completly fucked up
1895,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,First off do u know you can have seizures from doses that high of tram.. Second oxy is alot stonger start with no more then 25 mg
1896,First off do u know you can have seizures from doses that high of tram.. Second oxy is alot stonger start with no more then 25 mg,Yeah i will try 25mg and see what happens. I really hope i nod

1919,Its hard to quit when you totally dont want too.,A big part of me does want to quit. Really more than anything. But I feel like that addict part of my brain won’t give up. Like my brain is being controlled and it’s a constant battle between what I want and what my brain thinks I want.

I wanted to quit just like you. But would mess up Every time and try and justify it. Eventually we have to be honest with ourselves and admit you aren't totally ready. Just that realization made me want to quit Even more. And when I eventually did quit it was a lil different and i knew i HAD to stop. It doesn't have to happen that way. But it did for me. I always knew I wanted to quit but wouldn't act on it. The letdown you give yourself fucking hurts lol. Telling yourself. You'll quit but never do. Its no way to live life having a chemical control you like a parasite. You got this man. Have a lil faith or confidence. You know you can do this.

1924,"I want to quit suboxone. I have been given all the advise on how to physically quit, but how can I mentally quit?",Try liquid drops of CBD its concentrated it's not gonna get u high but it works really well on taking away pain and anxiety then ur not relying on any pharmaceutical.  I'm going through the same things myself so I understand I'm just going through withdrawals of over 12+ years opiates  now on suboxone but I'm in terrible pain so I use cbd . If u get quality stuff it runs about 150.0 so that's the only issue it can be expensive also depending where u live if it's legal I'm in California.  U can always order it online. Just a though.

1946,Wellbutrin as a potenator?,"A little searching yields this..

""If you take hydrocodone or oxycodone and either bupropion, dacomitinib, fluoxetine, hydroquinidine, paroxetine, or quinidine together, your pain medicine may not work as well.""

So i would guess no. Ive never heard of using it to potentiate either. Did someone tell you they do?"
1947,Wellbutrin as a potenator?,Wellbutrin has a stimulant like effect so no
1948,Wellbutrin as a potenator?,I used to snort those things when in wd's looking for energy or some buzz.   I honestly cant see how they would potentiate any opiate.
1949,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,"Yea bud. doesnt even really matter your weight. Even with zero tolerance youd just get a pretty solid nod going with that.

Edit:
Your weight definitely matters. i just mean that even at a low weight (120lb) you wouldnt really overdose.
Im no doctor though. I just know from experience.

Stay safe!"
1950,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,"We are not doctors so we cannot tell you what is safe and what is not safe. What I can say, is you can always take more, but you can never take less. So take some and evaluate how you feel in 30 minutes if you're okay, take a bit more, and so forth until you've reached your desired sweet spot. 

Also, just because it seems like you're early on in your addiction, consider quitting now. It's a lot easier to walk away while it's still a choice. That's all I'm gonna say on that because I don't want to patronize you."
1951,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,Yes because morphine has a low oral bioavailability but I wouldn't take it if you're on Oxy as that's a waste imo. If you want to add to the Oxycodone you already took take 25 to 50 milligrams of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).
1952,Yes because morphine has a low oral bioavailability but I wouldn't take it if you're on Oxy as that's a waste imo. If you want to add to the Oxycodone you already took take 25 to 50 milligrams of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).,What would be the best way to take the morphine?

1956,"I looked on psychonaut and it didn’t say anything about the two being dangerous I’ve took 500mg of tramadol anyway, feeling nice lol","Everyone’s different.  The danger with tramadol is more related to seizures, whereas codeine would just be respiratory depression really (or allergic reaction in a VERY rare instance).  If I were you, I’d just pick up an antihistamine like Doxylamine and take a dose of that with my codeine.  Definitely helps stop itching."
1957,What exactly is “nodding out” and why does it feel so good?,Hypnagogia. Similar to that half awake half asleep feeling you may get as your falling asleep or if you only partly wake up. Google it.
1958,Hypnagogia. Similar to that half awake half asleep feeling you may get as your falling asleep or if you only partly wake up. Google it.,lol such a weird word
1959,What exactly is “nodding out” and why does it feel so good?,"Neat question, but I feel like the answer might be so in-depth that it wouldn't mean that much to a layperson. Hopefully not though and someone answers. Even complicated things can sometimes be simplified to an extent that it can be understood to a lesser degree, but some things just require you to do the time to learn all the knowledge underpinning the understanding.

I know (and I mean know in the loosest possible sense) that benzos work by doing something to a certain chemical ""gate"" that moves things (ions?) from one place to another in the brain, which I think inhibits the effect of something called GABA at certain receptors. I've read that this is why mixing barbiturates and benzos is so lethal, because while one type of medication reduces or increases the number of these chemicals or ions, the other reduces or increases the frequency, meaning 2+2=8. I wonder if opiates work a similar way?

I had a look on wikipedia, on the [endorphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins) page:

>In the [PNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system), endorphins, primarily β-endorphin, are released from the pituitary gland and bind to μ-receptors. The binding of these two components inhibits the pain signal of the periphery nerves by blocking the neurotransmitter [substance P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_P). The mechanism in the CNS is similar but works by blocking a different neurotransmitter. When the endorphin binds to the μ-receptor, it inhibits the release of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which, in turn, increases the production and release of dopamine, the neurotransmitter associated with pleasure.\[15\]\[16\]

So it seems that opiates inhibit the release of GABA, but whether this is true of all opiates or just endorphins I don't know. But as far as I can tell there are a bunch of different opiate receptors with varying effects, and each opiate will have a distinct binding profile.

Whether this is significant or not, it seems that opiate receptors are considered ""G protein-coupled receptor"" ( ...constitute a large [protein family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_family) of [receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor) that detect [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) outside the [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) and activate internal [signal transduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction) pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses.). From wiki page on GABA:

>Two general classes of GABA receptor are known:\[3\]  
>  
>GABAA in which the receptor is part of a ligand-gated ion channel complex  
>  
>GABAB metabotropic receptors, which are **G protein-coupled receptors** that open or close ion channels via intermediaries (G proteins)  
>  
>Neurons that produce GABA as their output are called GABAergic neurons, and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the adult vertebrate.

So as far as I can tell opiates inhibit GABA and in turn causes dopamine to be produced. So they cause drowsiness in a similar way many ""drowsy"" medications do, such as benzos, but how similarly I don't know. I simply don't have the knowledge to know whether most of what I've written is right, because I don't have the more fundamental understanding of how the brain works, so don't take any of this as gospel. A little bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Whether we could understand to any meaningful extent an explanation beyond ""it does things to the chemicals in your brain"", who knows. Hopefully someone with the expertise can reply and try their best to dumb it down for us. May be worth posting this on ELI5 or another ask questions sub if you're really interested.

edit: Also worth keeping in mind that we don't fully understand how many medications work, opiates probably included. From [here](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/opioids-mechanisms-of-action):

>Inhibition of neurotransmitter release is considered to be the major mechanism of action responsible for the clinical effects of opioids. Nevertheless, despite extensive investigation, understanding of the cellular actions of morphine and other opioids is incomplete."

You won't make it home at all if you wreck and die, or even worse, kill someone else (worse bc you already knew the risks you were taking while driving high, those other people didn't sign up for that even if everyone knows that there is technically a chance of dying from getting hit by a driver under the influence every time they get in their car, you still don't expect it and shouldn't have to).

I always leave my rigs at home to make it easier to wait so that I couldn't do my shit even if I wanted to. Plus when you wait until you get home that makes the shot that much better bc you can just sit and enjoy it without having to worry about someone seeing you do it in your car or call the cops bc you're taking too long in the circle k bathroom so they assume you're shooting up, or have to worry about getting pulled over bc you're driving extra shitty since you're high.

2007,Anyone had a piss test sent to the lab while using fake pee (quickfix in my case)? What was your experience?,"You’re fine. Most employers have a contract with a certain lab, so they collect it wherever is convenient for you then ship it to thier lab. 

Just went through this a few weeks ago and i read a few stories online about people getting busted for substituting. The few of these stories that come up are suspicious. They usually are from new account users and don’t have many details. This leads me to believe that the reviews are fake perhaps from a shill for a different synthetic urine company. 

I also think that if you give the person administering the test any reason to suspect you may have just substituted they may have some BS protocol they go through to make you perform an observed test. Things such as taking way too long in the bathroom, or making noise with the bottle, leaving the bottle or cap in the bathroom. 

If its on temp and looks like pee the person administering the test cant really do anything even if they do suspect something.  If you made it past the initial validity testing done there at the collection site and they poured it into tubes and shipped it you are fine."

Thank goodness... It's based on education, experience, and skill.  They will check references but not a problem.  I'm actually a model employee as far as work and productions is concerned.  Have been in leadership departments of past employment locations for past 15 years.  Developed this problem really in 2015 but started when I broke my leg in 2002.  Funny...I enjoyed opioids then, and was in surgeries for 3 years straight... prescribed Opioids the ENTIRE 3 years.  Soon as I healed, didn't even ween off... just stopped.  And I know it's crazy, and maybe ignorance is bliss, but I swear I did not experience any withdrawals then.  

I didn't touch a single opiate until maybe 2005-8 at a party or two.... then nothing for 7 years.  A co worker had a steady supply and that's when I really began to enjoy the oxy ride.  It's so strange to me I could do 3 straight years of Oxy and stop without thinking about it before, but now that I know withdrawals are associated with stopping, I swear it makes it 1000 times worse.  Plus, I was in my early 20's back then so maybe my body processed the chemicals easier...kinda like when you're young and never used to get hangovers....now they last 3 days lol."

It was a god send as far as the energy it gave me and the ability to concentrate on my prep...not to mention the confidence I did not have leading up to this interview.

2070,I have absolutely no desire to eat anything after a 4 year addiction to hydrocodone. Any ideas?,"I've done 10 weeks off methadone and my appetite was the same but is improving slightly. You need to start small. Get some protein shakes or smoothies. Your stomach will have shrunk.

Also, try chocolate or anything you fancy so you can get some calories in.

I can also usually manage to force down some toast.

I also agree with the comments about smoking some weed.

Good luck."

2074,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,"This was brought up before and heavily debated on bluelight or opiophile in relation to another opiate, but the general consensus seemed to be that you'd have to drink GALLONS of tonic water to even get close to enough quinine. Tonic water is just too dilute.

There used to be higher dose quinine pills sold OTC in the USA for leg cramps, not sure if these are still available or not. 

Your best bet if you want to try this is finding a source for quinine pills online like a foreign pharmacy, or pure quinine powder(no idea on sources for either). Good luck, keep us updated!"

2077,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,I can't even find real Quinine water anymore.  Do you order it online?  The stuff they sell at the grocery stores contains barely any Quinine to be useful.
2078,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,"Modern tonic water contains considerably less quinine than it did in the past (when it was actually a malarial tonic). I’d imagine if it was as loaded with quinine as it used to be it would be unbearably bitter (unless you add plenty of Gin and limes!) so I’d assume that’s why. 

I think there’s something like 8mg of quinine per litre now, but that’s just off the top of my head and I’m almost certainly wrong so check it for yourself to find out exact numbers."
2079,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,The only opioid I've heard of people using Quinine to potentiate it's effects is Loperamide (Imodium).

Then tried another .5 grams to combine for a total of 2 grams, and I am chillin!!

Congrats on your taper so far!! Btw how as your taper? I tried going from 30 mg to 10 mg, and that was fine. Probably because I only dosed my 30 mg every 12 or 16 hours, well spread out, with sometimes only dosing 10 mg between each day until my next 30 mg dosage. I did that for a while, and it worked great. But then I had only 1 week of dosing 3-4x a day on 30mg, and my tolerance increased. 

So I decided I should try to taper just for a week or so to lower my tolerance. Going to 10 was fine, I did that for 5 days no problem at all. But when I tried going down to 0 mg, I still had bad stomach pains, restless legs, antsy behavior, anxiety. Not too bad though, but enough where I realized I was withdrawing.

So that's what led me to Kratom, and it's great so far. I would try doing 2-3 grams of Kratom"

But I would definitely start with that just to avoid getting sick. I need to also let you know when I say teaspoons, I literally referring to a level measuring teaspoon. Try not to use a kitchen spoon or anything as a guide because you won't get your dose right with that. The taste is bad, it's awful, but it sure beats the hell out of feeling sick and in withdrawals.

2095,Used China white heroin (never used an opioid before) for the first time a couple weeks ago. It was super underwhelming. What went wrong?,"Heroin is a little strong for a first opiate. When I see non opiate users try it, all of the other side effects often overpower the good feeling. If you're looking for typical opiate euphoria I would try something weaker like hydrocodone or oxycodone (if you can be sure that you're taking real pills).  


But all that aside, I would suggest not getting to the point where you have a taste for opiates. If you tried them once and didn't see what the hype was about, GREAT. Go back to your life. You won't have much of one if you keep doing H."

Now is the best time to stop and be glad it didn't work well for you. If you think you're in a rut now, just wait until you're in a worse rut and also withdrawing. I don't mean to sound blunt, but you're realllllllyyyy going to wish you went back in time and stopped yourself right here."

2104,Really? Everyone here talks about how euphoric opiates feel. If they didn’t feel pleasurable then why would people do them? And I have sever depression so I figured I would have felt something strong.,"I was surprised too. I'd describe them more as being extremely numbing as opposed to euphoric. You can imagine why a numbing drug would be popular among people who have been dealt a bad hand in life. Also fentanyl is also known for being more sedating as opposed to feel-good. Stimulants, now that's real euphoria.

Speaking logically, the best advice you will ever get is to never take recreational opioids again. If you're absolutely determined to try a new drug, which I would advise against, ketamine is probably the best option in your case and has less life-ruining potential.

I hope things get better soon♡"

I could see if you just didn't do as much activities as you used to, but doing nothing but staying home 100% of a year only shooting dope and sleeping is a long fuckin time to do nothing.

2151,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,"Addiction is only a small part of your equation. You clearly suffer from some kind of mental illness related to depression. The long term methods to turning your life around are the obvious ones, including exercise, proper sleep schedule, and social interaction. Obviously therapy, various blood tests, and likely medication are needed for you to recover. Now this is a huge double edged sword, but adderall might be beneficial for you in the SHORT term, IF you add it to the rest of what I mentioned.

2160,"Hi again guys, subutex, suboxone or methadone?","Suboxone if you were on weaker opiates (oxy, codeine, hydro, etc) and methadone for H or Fent, maybe even oxy depending on dose."
2161,"Hi again guys, subutex, suboxone or methadone?","It all depends on what else you have going on along with addiction. Like myself I have chronic pain so my choice is gonna be straight towards methadone. I've had both, methadone is an effective pain med and for myself it didnt give the the craving effect like other opiates have. The only thing I'd say to warn people of is be prepared to either get on it then get off as quickly as possible if you dont want to be dependent on a drug, if your gonna do the long haul make sure you are gonna be able to get this script for as long as you want/need it. Most say that you'll never lose a prescription as long as you abide by the guidelines, dont abuse it sell it whatever it would be to cause you to loose it. I know otherwise. Drug policies changing every day getting stricter made it impossible to continue methadone after 13 years of an unblemished script history when my doctor retired. I simply could not afford what the few doctors that prescribed methadone were wanting. Second thing is be prepared to loose your teeth. Theses meds dry your mouth out so bad it is unavoidable, so be prepared to be very proactive on dental care."

2164,so when would you administer the ginger capsules relative to dosing? before? once the nausea kicks in?,"Depends on the specific drug. Like with something like Kratom that's almost guaranteed to cause nausea I take it directly in combination. With things like oxy/hydro/tram/etc. I tend to wait until I feel the nausea setting in to take it. Though you can also definitely take a preventative approach with it rather than wait and take it the same time as your opiate if you'd like. That's probably what I'd recommend. Like 300-500mg directly with your dose, then another 300-500mg if needed."

2175,Why does heroin make life less boring?,"This is a somewhat philosophical question that deserves some philosophical pondering. I believe it falls directly in line with Lao Tzu and his “Tao Te Ching” explaining Taoism (Daoism)

“We mould clay into a pot,
but it is the emptiness inside
that makes the vessel useful.”

— Lao Tsu, Tao Te Ching quotes 11

Essentially - it’s not what a life “contains” that matters...it’s the creation and process of setting up the kind of life that is what is meaningful to the individual. Further, it’s how you create your experience and why you do it that makes it worth it (or not worth it).

So in your experience, you are creating a life that allows you to feel good about doing nothing. But if you did nothing without scoring, it would not be the life you want, and thus the boredom is palpable. When you score you know that you are giving yourself the confines of what you want, so whatever happens inside those confines, boredom, is much more acceptable to you and your mind.

A look into this can be seen as following:

However important it is, non-being cannot exist without the being.  A pot cannot be a pot without the clay.  A house cannot be a house without the pillars and walls. Money cannot play the role or exchange if cannot be recognised as a tool of trust.


Just a thought.

2215,Gabapentin and subutex?,Sorry mate I thought Subs had part Naloxone. Sounds like quite the operation lol. Do you recommend Clonidine for anxiety? Never tried it?
2216,Sorry mate I thought Subs had part Naloxone. Sounds like quite the operation lol. Do you recommend Clonidine for anxiety? Never tried it?,I mean I've been on it for a few years. I'd rather have klonopin lol. Works a lot better for me but docs wont give it to me

I used a lot of speed when I was younger. Honestly I never found it that recreational, I only used it for energy, concentration, motivation. Plus it was cheap enough to use everyday when I was still in school. It's euphoric, but different to oxy. It's worth a try I guess, but just note that if you rely on speed for energy/concentration regularly, it'll fuck up your sober energy and concentration levels."

2257,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,I wouldn't worry too much. Here in the US I can tell you that all of the treatment places ive been usually use one main medication to taper you off opiates whether it be oxys or dope you were using. This is usually some sort of suboxen or methadone. They usually add additional meds to help with anxiety and stuff. I have gone through the same exact treatment when I initially had a pill problem and when I became full blown IV dope user. What changed was the starting dosage of whichever tapering drug (methadone or subs) the facility would be using. Typically when you start the treatment process you will be dosed accordingly until your discomfort fades away. All you need to do is be vocal about how your withdraw symptoms are.. It really dosent matter pills or heroin. Best of luck.
2258,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,"Oxycodone does not show up under opiates, and heroin would test positive for opiates, they won't do just a standard 5 panel.. urine analysis kits have been around for so long, it's easy for any institution to choose a urine test that tells them what they need to know, or possibly test your blood, but they don't cater it to you that specifically, as stated above, u will get either Methadone, max they can give you is 30mg to start out, probably be more realistically 20/25mg, or Suboxone (Buprenorphine, and Nalaxone) 8mg\2mg, 
      If you are worried about them telling anyone else about your drug use, don't HIPPA protects your right to Privacy, unless you are considered a threat to yourself, or another person, in that case they are obligated t to say something. 
   The main reason they will drug test you is to make sure you in fact test positive for one opioid substance or another, since Methadone, and Buprenorphine are both powerful medications, they don't want to take the liability of giving a non opioid tolerant person a dose of either as it could be potentially very dangerous and even life threatening! 
   I've been in both programs several x and am very familiar with the process that take place in either the methadone clinic, and at a Suboxone Dr... Sounds like in your case you are more than likely going to b given Suboxone... Ns if you have any experience with it, but it's a lil strip, or a tablet you place under your tongue and let fully dissolve, I personally hate Suboxone, but there are others who swear by it, that said, they both do work to alleviate all w\d symptoms by 2nd day several hrs after 2nd dose.
    They will also in either case make sure you are in active withdraw b4 they give you either med as well, it's easy enough to fake this part if you had to, just look up all the symptoms of opioid use disorder ""post acute withdraw symptoms"" or PAWS, and memorize... A Dr will ask u a series of questions, the goal is to basically say you are currently experiencing as many symptoms on that list as possible 👍 how that helps you understand what is likely going to happen going forward in either case, good luck!"
2259,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,Tell them about the dope because if you don’t get any comfort meds it’s gonna be extremely hard to stop.
2260,Tell them about the dope because if you don’t get any comfort meds it’s gonna be extremely hard to stop.,"What ""comfort meds"" are you thinking they will give besides methadone or buprenorphine, definitely no Benzo as these programs are getting extremely strict as far as putting anyone on Either Bupe and benzos, or m\done and benzos, they might give you an otc non-stimulant stool softener, Buspirone for anxiety, Seroquel for help sleeping and really I don't see much of any other comfort meds being used that isn't otc garbage, or shit meds rx'd to you basically no one in the program will want to take.

I'm taking 30mg codeine tabs... 8 of those in separate doses throughout the day.  So 240mg daily I guess?  

I once had a Rx for Restasis but they opted to skip that & go straight for the tear duct plugs, lol.  So I guess that's an option I haven't tried."
2286,Where could it have gone?,"The strips can be removed by cutting a slit in the foil package. If done right the slit is unnoticeable.

Back in my early days i had done that with some of my strips then when i was desperate and sick as fuck i sold a few to this guy i knew.  I did make it right on the next script but you gotta actually feel if theres a strip ib there to be safe"

2289,How would he get into the safe?,Shit! Ask my wife! She will do a whole fucking YouTube series on how to get into any safe and steal all your shit....
2290,How would he get into the safe?,He could have known my code. It’s the weight I wrestled my Sr. year of high school and he knows I’ve incorporated that into my PIN number for my debit card. How tf else would it disappear? Unless the person who sold it to me ripped me off.. but she’s a close family friend I’ve known for years! She would never do that! Him stealing it tho? I know that’s something he’s more than capable of doing.

Literally every day it’s a new lie about what he’s doing. He’s literally let me withdraw for two days before saying that he was sick too and didn’t have any more. I later found out he had PLENTY but didn’t want to chance running out before re-up. He’s been lying to me about the price of them too. So I’ve basically been paying for both his stash and mine, and his is twice the size! Haha. But he will deny deny deny even if I were to show him a damn video of it. He would try and come up with some bogus answer haha."
2293,Where could it have gone?,"Your boy definitely took it. If you cut it open then it wouldn't matter if it was already opened previously, it would still only open where you cut it at if it was either glued or melted back together, as long as he did a decent job of gluing or melting it"

2311,Who uses “make-up” to hide scabs and track marks?,"Hey! A good option if you’re really committed to hiding the track marks is to first apply a green color corrector. That will neutralize the dark marks. You can apply it with your fingers and kind of buff, or blend, it in. Then go over that with concealer that matches your skin tone. Again you can use your fingers for that. If you really want it to last you can buy powder to set it with."
2312,Who uses “make-up” to hide scabs and track marks?,"I never IV’d, but learning how to do my own makeup years ago has been awesome in general (as a dude.) Everything from under-eye circles to scars are gone if I want. Great for looking fresh on little to no sleep."

I'm a girl and I have a hard time finding the right color foundation because I have freckles, but I went into an Ulta store (sephora or the like would work) and they have samples of the concealers out so you can try them and find the right shade.

2316,Is it safe to chug a beer or two on suboxone?,"A couple things to consider—

Buprenorphine is metabolized by the liver, so your liver health and overall drinking history and habits are worth considering.

The main concern with buprenorphine and alcohol is respiratory depression, where tolerance and dosing and bupe’s long half-life come into play, along with other factors (especially any other meds or supplements that could contribute.)

The biggest issue I see is....Natty Ice? You may want to see a professional on that one ;)

Edit — in another thread you said you’re almost nodding? If your tolerance is that low to bupe at the moment, I would not push it with alcohol. Being on subs long-term versus recreationally makes a big difference with respiratory depression."

Did a trial force spinal stimulator and then doing 150ug fent patches every 30 hours wasn't financially viable so I decided to try a sufentanil pump as the morphine pump failed.

I'd recommend some kind of behavior therapy or group therapy..learn coping skills..

Then again idk if it was that or just dealing with anxiety so long that I finally figured out a way to handle it when I dont have meds. Been rough lately..lot of drinking.  But I been through 2 surgeries and a wreck over the past year and am in constant pain and since florida is blamed for the whole opiate epidemic it's almost impossible to find doctors here now that will actually help.. even the crooked ones require a referral to cover their tracks these days.
One such doctor someone told me about I gave them 3 MRI and a stack of papers all from doctors anout all I'd been through ..hip surgery knee surgery and a wreck..and they still refused to see me because one of the doctors didnt return their call..its ridiculous..

They can be +/- 10% of the peak plasma level achieved by the name brand. So in theory, two generics could differ by as much as 20% in terms of peak plasma level, but can only differ by a maximum of \~4-5% in terms of active ingredient.

2354,"I've purchased zubsolv before, which is dosed in lower quantities for a similar reason as bunavail. I don't seem to absorb sublingual/buccal drugs very well (too much saliva due to dental work), so I just snort my suboxone/subutex in a tiny 0.4ml solution that has baking soda added to make it pH 6.5-7.5. Since I filter out the pill binders, the bioavailability is pretty much \~50% +/- 5% no matter what form I use. That's why I asked, because 8% more for the same price with insurance seems like a no brainer.

That doesn't appear to be why generic subutex contains 8% more though.",Zubsolv has bigger sizes out now.  They have a 12mg equivalent and i think even a 1mg and possibly a 16mg equivalent. Obviously they are in their weird dose sizes like the original ones are so maybe its the 12mg equivalent zubsolv that would be like ~9mg
2355,Panic attacks?,"Hey dude, this could possibly a reaction to anything that your dope is cut with. Maybe some Strange new/old fent analogue or smth else. it could be literally everything.

 If you dont send your dope to any testing company then you never will know. It is also highly possible that with a new batch the panic attacks will be gone. Or in the worst case scenario cause no one says a thing your dboy uses more of the cut that is causing this and it gets worse. 

If I were you, I would talk about it with your dboy. Just be nice and friendly and tell him whats happening with you and your body. Give him a feedback. Otherwise he wont will know about that issue. I know that many customers are afraid to tell their dboy that their dope is shit but if you dont do it he wont will know it and wont do shit about it. 

Maybe he already gets his dope cut Like this. Then he has to make the same conversation with his dealer like you need to do with him. 

So the best advice is to a) send it in and get it checked (IDK about the USA but in my country its a free service or b) talk to your dealer which may be uncomfortablw but at least you will know two things ftom talking with him. 1) If he cares about his quality and 2) if he cares about his customers. I wish you the best of luck and if you want to know my opinion the best choice would be to talk to him."

2379,Will three days get me past the worst of it?,"I’d conserve and save that sub for when ever you truly fucking need it and can’t take it anymore.  And no point should you feel 100% normal or comfortable because if so then you’ve taken too much. Wait as long as you can and take half a mg. Should keep you ok for 12ish or more hours but I’d wait like 24 before taking another half. But who’s really say what you’ll experience. They’re a so many variables in these situations. Your tolerance, how long you’ve used, how much suboxone you’ve ever used, how you respond to suboxone. Take me for example, if I was seriously going through it and had been using dope continuously for some time that 3/4 isn’t gonna do much except maybe keep me from shitting my pants, I’d still be a miserable useless sweaty anxious mess.

But if you absolutely have to bang it, snort a match tip size bump first just to gage how good it is, then go from there. If it's awful or decent or in between do 1/4 a point (a point is 0.1g), if it's amazing do 1/8 a point.

2404,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,Gotta hit the right dosage for your tolerance and it is bliss plus energy. At least for me. Oxycodone is the shit. If you’re looking for true bliss/euphoria in a pill then you need opana my friend! Oxymorphone is the best drug I have tried. Well opiates at least. My heart and mind still love mdma and lsd. Especially together. Morphine is boring. Dilaudid is alright. That’s hydromorphone. Look for those pandas duder.
2405,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,"Dilaudid fucking sucks ass, but opana is amazing so if you can get some you need to jump on that as quickly as humanly possible"
2406,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,Apparently everyone is different. Oxymorphone for me is even more energizing than oxycodone and it doesn't put me to sleep like hydromorphone and hydrocodone do. It's euphoric for sure but I can never nod from it and it doesn't feel like noddy heaven right before bed like the hydros do. A puff of weed helps give it a noddy edge but sometimes it takes away from the euphoria.
2407,Tomorrow bright and early I’m finally tapering. I will be going down from 48 mg a day to 30mg. Then in two weeks down to 24mg. And stabilize at 24mg for a while. What can I expect? Also doctor put me on suboxone so it’ll be my first time taking suboxone instead of subutex,"How long have you been on 48mg per day?  There should be no difference from subutex and suboxone for you, unless you’re shooting it.  Even then many people say there is no difference whatsoever.  At over 32mg, I’m not sure of the side effects of the naloxone to be honest.  Most docs script under 32.  
 
The buprenorphine itself actually presents a higher binding affinity than naloxone does under normal conditions.  When people get PWD (precip withdrawal, after taking subs too soon following use of full agonists) it’s not the naloxone causing it, it’s the high affinity of the bupe.  It kicks other opioids off receptors, and doesn’t allow you to get “high” (at least not easily)

I imagine you’ll be just fine with the taper.  You can always ask for minor adjustments as needed; maybe even ask your prescribing physician for a direct(ish) number to call if your symptoms are too bad - if you feel lucky.  Maybe even ask to stay on subutex and do the taper if it makes you more comfortable.  You can always warm yourself up to it beforehand by taking bits and pieces less each day until your taper appt. 

Then you’ll even have some emergency milligrams to spare :p"

Nothing good ever came from it .if you absolutely must just take a nibble of Xanax. Seriously with heroin you don’t need a lot. I used to to use Xanax to potentiate shitty heroin. At one one point. My wreck less ass was putting Xanax and heroin in the same spoon. So fucking sloppy I’d have to be carried and left In the car everywhere we went,The heroin I have now is shitty anyways lmao. Like these people are telling me I’m gonna die and I’m gonna be pretty pissed if I wake up in the morning lol now that I got the thought in my head 😂😂

2444,[deleted],I have a pretty high tolerance to both bc I was doing like 5mg xanax a day for a week then ran out and got back w my dope plug and been doing less than a point a day for the past 3 or 4 and I did like less than a point today too. Everyone just kept saying I was gonna die so I freaked kinda but I also have nothing to live for so I was just gonna listen to music and go to sleep and go peacefully.  I think it’s been a couple hours since the xans. It was light outside when I did. Not tryna offend anyone I just don’t value my life but I’m more scared of dying painfully than anything.

2451,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,Xans and opiates is fun if you can handle both. But if you don't have a benzo/opiate tolerance. You're an idiot. I almost died mixing bars and OC 80 back in the day. Fell out immediately upon feeling the effects of the OC. I wish I could say it was scary. But I just remember feeling good and what not. Drugs suck but are fun sometimes. I guess. Oh well I'm on ketamine and weed rn. Have a nice night. Be safe.

2457,"As everyone beat me to it, its best not to. I learned the hard way and would always have micro-overdoses whenever i mixed xans and fent, luckily i never had a full blown overdose, and i never had the balls to mix xans and smack.",Well granted it was like 4:30pmish when I took the Xanax maybe like 6:30pm or earlier when I took the dope. I’m alive rn (10:47pm) and not even too high anymore so I guess I’ll be good. I wanna finish this last bit of dope up but at this point Id be playing Russian roulette lol
2458,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,Everyone's a soon just don't go hard on both
2459,Everyone's a soon just don't go hard on both,Yeah had me thinking I was bout to die. Well look who woke up today....
2460,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,All the times I went out like waking up in an ambulance out was when I mixed fent and xans. But I had a really heavy IV tolerance to opis and would pop like 10 plus mg of xans in a short period of time. Just be super careful if you do it is really dangerous I’ve lost a lot of friends. I wouldn’t advise it to anyone. But snorting the xans is a waste too anyways if you do that.
2461,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,I’ve seen a friend do it many a times.
2462,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,"In order, I snorted half of 1mg xr Xanax I had crushed from a few nights ago, popped a whole 1mg xr Xanax pill, then snorted a few small lines of dope."

2477,Why does suboxone give me an amphetamine like high?,Same it's fucked do you IV it by ant chance
2478,Same it's fucked do you IV it by ant chance,"Nah I dont IV it, I'm always scerred I'll fuck it up and damage a vein or something. Plus my parents are super nosey and they'd find out eventually cuz I'm an everyday user. I just mix it in a tad of water and put it in a nasal spray bottle, I'll mix like 20 subs in a bottle and keep it handy"
2479,Why does suboxone give me an amphetamine like high?,Do you take any other opiates as a rule or only just the sub? Many opiates give you that energetic feeling with focus. If you don't have a tolerance and take a small dose (generally) you get that feeling bigtime and it lasts a long time. I usually do 4mg at a time twice a day and get that feeling within an hour of taking it. It's not as pronounced a feeling compared to when I'm totally sober and do a sub though.

2483,Why does suboxone give me an amphetamine like high?,"I used to get that energized euphoric high from any opiates. It eventually went away with amounts and time using increased. I have never even understood why everyone wants to ""nod""? To me that's just a waste of good drugs! Anyway to each is there own! Enjoy it any way you can, and no do not mix subs with any opiate..."
2484,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,I dont think so
2485,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,"The rule with subs is generally less is more. I'd take 1/4 of it or a half just to save money and get more doses out of it. If I'm taking my first dose of the day, I can't tell a difference between 4mg and 8mg. I haven't been on subs long but long enough to have made that out."
2486,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,It won't if you stick at that dose. Anything above 12-16 (at once) mg IMO is a waste. Your milage may vary
2487,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,Don't snort it just put it under your tongue. You get the exact same effect that way without the possibility of losing some that you get with snorting it
2488,Is it safe to do coke and subs at the same time?,It's as safe as combining 2 highly potent addictive substances can be. Which is not much. But as long as you keep it in reason I would not expect much harm.
2489,Is it safe to do coke and subs at the same time?,"Nothing like a speedball. 

You're better off waiting until the coke is gone to take any sub"

2511,Gotcha. What do you mean careful btw? Like be careful not to use too much water?,"Exactly, nasal sprayers are effective in how they distribute/deliver the water nasally, but they only deliver tiny amounts of at once, so you’d have to spray it more and more depending on how much water you use to dissolve the strip. And that’s all just to get one strip up your nose. 

A brand new, full bottle of Afrin nasal spray, for example, is 15mL so you’d want to use far less than that for it to make practical sense."

Put them under your tongue.  They're made to be used that way. Their bioavailibility is high sublingually then putting it in your nose.

Insufflation has I believe in the 60 to 75 % range when done correctly and a lot of people do it wrong. 

The strips are purposely made for sublingual, and I haven't check the percentage,  but usually when they're made a specific way, they have an extremely high BA that way.

Let me check and come back with an edit, specifically for subs.

Edit: well fuck me running.  It's got a very very poor absorption rate sublingually. 30 to 55% is what all the clincal data reports.  

I was wrong. Apologies. I'd figure the formula would be much better sublingually."

Youre going to need about 30-50mgs though, 20 didnt even touch me when i first started using. Also, alcohol takes away from the effect of the Vicodin, so I'd recommend not drinking until about 3 hours after youve hit your peak"
2520,Can you get high off vicodin?,What whiskey do you drink? I love opiates and whiskey
2521,Can you get high off vicodin?,30mg hydro is around 20mg oxy. 20mg hydro is around  ~13.3mg oxy which wouldn't get me high even without tolerance. So yes you can. But you shouldn't be liek that and start using google.

I'm tired of being always cold, low energy etc.  I had much more energy, drive, and motivation when I was clean.   Even with an infinite stash of opiates I'd probably just waste my life getting high and doing nothing, but at least with a stash like that you wouldn't have to worry about chasing dope."
2536,Who wants to be clean?,"I'm OFF all opiates. I'm off all methamphetamine.  I'm off all benzos. I'm literally off everything.  I'm 30. I never expected to live pass 27. I always expect to be a static because that's all that I've ever felt I was worth.

I've realized, I'm worth more. I don't want to go back. I don't want to be involved anymore. I've picked up so many felonies this year. I think I had a total of 14 felony charges, 4 of 5 Misdemeanors, and I was still getting stopped by cops.

I've settled some of the stuff,  but I don't want to give up my life to jail. I don't want to stay in the cycle.  

Sure, if there was no social, emotional or physical impact upon myself,  others and the police. I'd get high every single day for the rest of my life, but there are consequences and I'm done with them.
Edit: spelling"

2539,Very low dose subs enhanced high?,Seems to be the case for me with mcg doses of naltrexone.
2540,Very low dose subs enhanced high?,How’s it work ? U take how much and when in relation to when u ingest opiates?
2541,Very low dose subs enhanced high?,"Not sure about Suboxone with the antagonist attachment, but I know when I do some sublingual bupe with mega high affinity, I add a little Oxy later and it is as though I have been awarded a prize for filling ever cell and receptor subtype there is."
2542,Very low dose subs enhanced high?,"yes, actually. and bupe can even behave more like a full agonist vs the partial it truly is, in minuscule doses like that"
2543,Very low dose subs enhanced high?,"How am I just hearing about this now.   
    any ideas on timing ?  
     Would it make sense to mix in .1 mg in same shot as dope/fentadope? Or do the micro bupe shot, wait 45 min, then the real shot?  
  Thinking option b"
2544,Very low dose subs enhanced high?,I’ve noticed this too! I’m pretty sure it’s because there is just more filling up your receptors and in return giving a fuller high
2545,Does anyone know the half life for 2 methyl ap 237?,"Search the name on pubmed, maybe you'll find some studies. If not no one else can tell you the half life, that drug is new"
2546,Can I drink ontop of suboxone?,"yeah 3 beers should be fine..it's just not advisable to get shitfaced on any opiod or opiate..especially without a tolerance..and if you're taking suboxone for recreational use, be careful and take like .5 mg. if you take too much you will feel horrible for a long peroid of time"

I just happen to be one of those people who doesnt get nauseous from even a whole strip, so it's a beautiful miracle drug for me. But I've never drank ontop of them so I'll take it slow this time. Thanks for advice!"
2548,Can I drink ontop of suboxone?,Makes me feel like total shit if I have more than a couple drinks. Not good synergy between the 2.

2557,Has anyone ever recorded themselves high?,I make pictures of myself after I used. Writing on the pics how much I used etc. and strangley I just look nearly exactly the same like when I just woke up. The only difference are my eyes of course and  that I am also often a bit pale. But otherwise I look semi normal and not disgusting. But maybe its the ROA too since I aniff my dope and dont shoot it. But the few times I shot my dope I looked like I was serious ill and about to die. But if I record myself while nodding it looks very strange and disgusting thats true. Oh and one time I recorded myself while on some xans and dope that was awful disgusting.

I love seeing videos of me or anyone else shooting up heroin, it makes me salivate tbh since that's my RoA of choice. But like the sub name implies, the needle itself and IVing is its own addiction entirely, like not only are you addicted to your DoC, but you're also addicted to shooting it up as well and the whole ritual behind it of sucking back your water, putting your shit in the spoon or cooker, squirting the water onto it, heating it if need be, mixing it around, putting in your filter, sucking it back up, tying off, then digging around for a vein.

Then as soon as that flash of bright red pops up in the needle it's honestly like porn it's so fucking sexy. ESPECIALLY if you were sick, ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY if you were sick and it's the first shot of the day. Tbh I LOVE recording my first shot of the day when I can finally take my sickness away.

Oh, but when I'm hitting him I can't talk bc if I ever try to in order to give him a taste of his own medicine he'll throw an absolute bitch fit temper tantrum and tell me he's gonna take all of my shit regardless of if I miss on him or not.

He's recorded me a couple times too and I absolutely could not fucking stand what I saw in the video either, but I usually don't get high when I do my shit bc I like to be able to stretch it out so that I don't have to be sick as much.

In an alternate universe, I definitely probably didn't not film a close-up of a line being snorted just because I thought it might be fascinating to view down the road... or to serve as ""stock footage"" of using drugs.


I've definitely done a number of ""talk to the camera/camera phone"" bike rides while on dope. I probably have those videos since I don't say anything incriminating in those videos.

I wonder.....

Usually if I was doing that, I was more ""energetic"" as opposed to nodding out. Such videos often happened while riding my bicycle to work but I've done it on days off. In fact, now that I'm thinking about it.. oh shit... I gotta check a video, I wanna see if I can correlate the date to determine if I was on dope or subs at the time."
2612,Clonidine and kratom...what do y’all do for a job?,funemployed
2613,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,"My cousin used to squeeze out the liquid onto a plate, microwave it, then snort the dry powder"
2614,"My cousin used to squeeze out the liquid onto a plate, microwave it, then snort the dry powder",Plenty of people have overdosed from shooting the gel from a patch. I guess its very easy to misdose
2615,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,I cut a strip and fold it backwards to itself so both sides are facing out and put it in my mouth between my gums and lip . Kinda like chewing tobacco. That got me lit I nodded out found it on the floor the next day and put it back in my mouth and got loaded again lol but I was also on OC 80’s at the time so I had a lot in the old system...
2616,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,Yea depending on the brand (Mylan) and if it’s not a gel patch you can cut up the strips into small pieces and put under your tongue.  It will get you blown but be careful obviously bc it can cause overdose.  I wouldn’t recommend it ever but It feels like heaven.
2617,Yea depending on the brand (Mylan) and if it’s not a gel patch you can cut up the strips into small pieces and put under your tongue.  It will get you blown but be careful obviously bc it can cause overdose.  I wouldn’t recommend it ever but It feels like heaven.,"I just lick the old ones after I take them off, I wear them for my rheumatoid arthritis pain, I wear it for 4 days and then after I take it off, I lick the whole patch over and over until all fentanyl has been eaten, I look at it to make sure not a single particle of fentanyl is left and then throw the empty patch away. 

Mine are malinkordt brand, not the gel kind. It has a matrix with little ridges where the fentanyl drips a little of drug into ur skin like an iv drip kind of. I only lick it after wearing it for 4 days, to gain the best benefits for my pain I use norco 5s for breakthrough pain. My tolerance is huge, I had 3 vials of dilaudid in the hospital for back surgery."
2618,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,"I ate a fent lollipop but not a patch, that shit can be dangerous depending on the dosage so be careful my guy... I'm guessing with that name ur gonna be ok"
2619,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,Years ago my mom and her coworkers would put them on their lower back and then use a blowdryer heat to make the drug release faster into their system. They use to make fent lollipops long back the opiate epidemic bullshit
2620,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,I used to cut em open and just eat the gel. Be careful tho :/
2621,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,My first 100/ug h patch i cut about a fifth of and put it on my cheek. I woke up tasting the dirtyass carpet. Dont know how close i came to oding and dieing but it was more than i could handle at the time. Dident recall a buzz just finally getten to try these to realizing i was in the middle of the floor unconcious for an hour. Home alone gf had finally left to see her mom. Took all of 15 seconds from saying bye to playing with the patch. Prob on the floor 15 minutes after. All in all glad she dident find me the next day dead on the flooor...she would have killed me lol
2622,Fist fighting on Opiates?,"Stupid... I don't believe this at all but if true it was the benzos and alcohol that made you fight. Of course oxy will dull the pain.

It's hilarious you admit you got smacked up and couldn't land more than one punch... Then he pulls a round house? Lmfao. 

Hope your teeth are ok..."

Don’t offer people stuff or engage in conversation with random people. and you’ll probably have a better chance of not taking a “heater to the grill” whole situation could’ve been avoided if you minded your own business in my opinion."
2624,Fist fighting on Opiates?,Have not personally engaged in the fisticuffs but the dude I had been seeing at the time would get the opirage and decided to fight this other dude that I was just friends with and he (my dude) ended up getting tasered on the finger and he didn’t feel it until later. But that might have just been because he was super amped up with adrenaline since he was in a fight and whatnot

2627,Fist fighting on Opiates?,A lot of u being able to eat that punch is due to adrenalin
2628,A lot of u being able to eat that punch is due to adrenalin,"Yup way stronger than pain meds. Op it’s like a car accident. Everything’s cool for now, but I’m sure you’re jaw won’t be feeling to good later."
2629,Fist fighting on Opiates?,"Yeah. Me and my friends all took Xanax. I think like 1-2 bars each. I hardly remember what really happened.

We had 1 friend sober, driving us and we parked somewhere downtown so our friend could roll up. The 3 of us on bars got out of the car and started brawling. (No idea why) none of us seriously got hurt, one of them did have welts on his head tho. I was wearing a white hoodie, and the next morning it was completely green and brown. 

Our sober friend had no idea we were serious for the first 5 mins, and he wasn’t trying to break us 3 up when we were on bars. Lol. But yeah people get aggressive on bars"
2630,Fist fighting on Opiates?,Too many times
2631,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,"10mg to be safe and feel it, 15mg if you’re willing to accept the likelihood of nausea."
2632,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,To the best of my knowledge weight doesn't effect opiate tolerance at all but my advice would always be to start at a low dose. You can always take more if you don't reach the desired effect you're looking for.
2633,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,10-15 is sufficient for a first timer
2634,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,I would go 15 just to be safe but yeah you should be fine on 30 to be honest
2635,I would go 15 just to be safe but yeah you should be fine on 30 to be honest,"""Should be"" lol. I don't like that. Would I still get high on 15 though?

2640,I would go 15 just to be safe but yeah you should be fine on 30 to be honest,30mg is way too much. I would start with 15 and increase by 5mg every 20 minutes. However I am here using irregulary since 8 months and everything above 20mg will get me sick.
2641,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,"10 to 15 is what I always recommend for a first timer. You can take 10 and if you're not happy after 30 minutes take 5 more milligrams.  Or just take 15 and nod out. The other poster is right though, you might get a little nauseous. Have fun!"

I don't plan on getting more though. Just want to see what an opiate high is like. I've tried many drugs but never really opiates, just want to get it out of my system and don't plan on doing anymore to be safe (I know it can be a slippery slope)."
2648,Smoke or chew fent patch??,Fentanyl has in general a short half life. So there wont be any difference between chewing or smoking. But smoking them is a bit safer cause it is possible that the fent isnt everywhere the same mcg amount on the patch. For example if you got a 100mcg patch there could be in one corner 40mcg and in the other just 10mcg. And for chewing you mostly cut the patch in pieces and then you could chew on the 40mcg or the 10 mcg piece so its more likely to OD. So I would rather smoke it than chew on it.

2657,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,"Now think of the opposite of that and you have withdrawals:

Going to work with just a dose of codeine to tide you by as you try a taper.  I'm freezing cold yet the children at the school I work at, are all running around in t-shirts.  

The environment is so loud, the lights so bright. Every little noise makes me twitch and jump. I sit in my chair in my office, and look at all the helpdesk tickets I've ignored. Work is piling up yet I am too dead to get out of my chair.

I spend my day in work in my office, by my heater, reading reddit. Kids are fighting outside my office (which is in a main coridoor).  I wish for them to go away.

I come home, to find my parents are pissed off with me as they have found some of my codeine 60's. ""You're taking those tablets again"" they say.  As if I can just stop taking them, throw them out, no worries at all."

I did get a little high off 3 tramadol once, but I think I gave away the bag I had. I don't know what happened to those fuckers."

I loved that vinegar smell and taste, the ritual, everything aswell as the high. i was hooked from the start. i would go out and chill in my van at 4:30 am or so when the world was still asleep and the sun was just about to start rising, on this particular day i went out there, (it was parked in my driveway, its like those vans you see ""vanlifers"" living in with carpet and a couch, recliners and a chest table in there, the passenger seat spun around and id go out there early in the morning, a rainy day on this particular day, and i plugged my gamecube into the outlet in there and ran an extension chord from my house to my van. id then sit out there as the rain hit the roof, in my cozy suburban driveway in the PNW, playing my favorite old games, getting super nostalgic about my childhood, and smoking tar. this was back before i got big into fent and tar would actually get me high. id take a little BB sized ball and smoke that over the course of maybe 20 min and actually be nodding out. ahhh, so nostalgic. then id have my boys come over once they woke up around 9 and wed drive to the river, open the doors facing the beautiful view of the columbia river, and hotbox with weed and crack beers while id smoke a few more hits here and there throughout the day.

First few lines of dilaudid were godly too, zonked for a solid 90 min best body high ever

2672,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,"It was around the year 2000 , there was a foot of snow outside and I was sitting by the fire. I had discovered opiates and The Lord of the Rings. I think that was probably the zenith of childhood before the jarring cusp of reality and adulthood. I’m very happy now, but if I was forced to choose to relive one moment over and over again - it would probably be around there. I’m definitely romanticizing it in my head as things were not all good at that time, but it was before opiates kicked my ass and forced me to realize just how life altering they can be."

When I told the sub dr that and told him that sometimes I could fall asleep standing. I work on elevators so that a big fuck no. He put me on adderall 60mg/ day and that got me back in the game. I’m not naive. It’s probably not something a recovering drug addict should be able to get there hands on but whatever I’ve been on them legally for 1.5yrs and fuck yea,  Ive been known to take the last 3 2weeks before my refill is available.

The whole point of subs is for people to switch to them without going thru detox then take the subs every day to replace shooting dope.  By starying subs youre eventuallu gonna have to detox off them eventually and sub detox is worse than dope detox."

2680,Would taking kratom while withdrawing from suboxone pro long how long I withdrawal for?,Short answer is yes. Long answer is its worth it. Just quit the kratom after a week or two and its not too bad. Or stay on for maintenance. Imo its better than subs and methadone bc youre basically sober and the wd isnt nearly as bad.

2683,So I can fully get thru the suboxone withdrawals while on kratom then after a week or 2 I'll just have to deal with kratom withdrawals?,Yeah pretty much. I'd go at least 2 weeks. Bc sub wds are brutally long. Taper the kratom and the wd will be mild.
2684,Would taking kratom while withdrawing from suboxone pro long how long I withdrawal for?,"My issue with Subutex is I'll be on it forever.

2690,Will kratom get me high?,You may like it? Just cause I dont think it's the same doesn't mean it wont work for you...
2691,Will kratom get me high?,It may get you a small buzz. It may help kill some pain. But kratom is not a drug in the sense its gonna get you happily loaded.

Depends.

Tramadol **can** be amazing recreationally. Really. But not for everyone. Some people swear to god that Tramadol gives them a oxy like high (without tolerance obviously) ans some people don't feel it at all."
2756,Tramadol...worth it recreationally?,"Tramadol and codeine. Each to their own I'm afraid. Try them and see.

Tramadol does shit all for me, and I'm prone to seizures so whenever I use it to bridge buprenorphine gaps I never go above 100mg per day. I've never got high from it. Sadly that's all my parents get now. No more unlimited codeine, then dihydrocodeine, then morphine, then fentanyl patches. Just Tramadol. 

Same with dihydrocodeine, on its own, I have never gotten high from it. Just a huge histamine reaction.

Now codeine is another story. I am an extremely efficient metaboliser so 32 hours off Subutex 300mg of codeine will give me a good buzz.

I have found codeine and dihydrocodeine to have good synergy for me. I find adding 200/300mg dihydrocodeine to the same codeine dose enhances the buzz, warmth and duration of the experience. I find with standard hayfever OTC anti-histamines it will dramatically reduce the histamine reaction.

Try everything you can in small doses to see what fits you. Each of us has a unique biochemistry and neurochemistry so each and every drug will affect each of us differently."

It's embarrassing. I don't even put tissue down there anymore and have to be sure to cut em up if they're too big... My neighbour seems to have trouble telling me though, which probably inconveniences her more than it does me seeing as I tend to smell the issue after she does. I mean absolutely, she shouldn't have to smell my shit, but she has to tell me there's an issue for me to be able to sort it out. I think she's nervous of me or something but still she could leave a note or put one through my letterbox. 

I find it's best to start by holding a large bucket of water about chest height then pouring it all at once into the bowl, that usually will dislodge stuff due to the pressure. Failing that some sort of acid designed for the problem. Can get strong sulphuric acid here which dissolves pretty much anything alive or dead, for now at least. That always does the trick but I'm not sure how good it is for the pipes or environment (not to mention my relations with my neighbour), so I try to make this a last resort."

2791,Is nodding out a sign of OD?,"When you ""nod"", you can be easily snapped out of it and be moderately coherant.

2795,Is nodding out a sign of OD?,"depends what you're looking for from your opiate experience (pain-killing or an actual nod-out). if you don't want to nod out, then nodding out is an OD, but not an emergency. just use less next time. if you want to nod out, I would have a sitter with you who is not going to be on anywhere near as much, if any, of the drug, who will have narcan on hand to use in case you go from nodding out to falling out."
2796,Is nodding out a sign of OD?,"If you are just nodding you'll wake up in a slumped over nodding position.

If you barely od, just reach the threshold, you'll wake up on the ground, confused by how you got there; no recollection of falling to the ground.

In my experience you somehow never fall over when only nodding -- it's like anti-gravity mode. But when you ""fall out"" you literally hit the ground."

2799,Is nodding out a sign of OD?,"Really anything over an intended dose is considered an OD, it doesn’t have to be life threatening.
I personally prefer doses that don’t make you nod, but the occasional nod can be nice if you have nothing to do.
If someone’s breathing gets really shallow or stops and they are unresponsive is where things get dangerous. Some people also asphyxiate if they nod in a position that blocks their breathing fyi, so if you’re concerned about someone but they are not in any obvious danger just lay em back so they aren’t slumped over straining their breathing"

2824,Higher binding affinity=Can you explain this in dummy terms?,"okay.. you have a trampoline, 10 kids are jumping on it. theres a magnet inside the trampoline - this is the opiate receptors inside your brain. 9 of your kiddos have magnets stuck to their shoes (these guys are your bupe), forcing them to bind tightly to the trampoline aka opiate receptors. 1 kid is jumping alongside them but has no magnets on his shoes, hes the naloxone. so he doesnt bind to the trampoline (brain) because hes so overpowered by the other force with the higher binding affinity, therefore this kid is negligible and isnt even in the magnet to have an impact. hes just kinda there. mainly for patent purposes, and for abuse deterrent (naloxone taken sublingually has nearly 0% BA anyway, but shot up it has  different affect which they try to steer ppl from doing)

2838,[deleted],Also tolerance only 2 weeks 40 mg for sure
2839,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,I used it after tapering off oxy I used for more than 20 yrs.  I used the Kratom for 8 months.  It helped a lot.  It effects people differently.  I don’t get any euphoria from it like I’ve heard others experience.

2841,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,If you have a heavy habit then it won’t do much
2842,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,"I don't get any euphoria, but find it extremely helpful for symptoms like bone and joint pain, restless legs, and anxiety."
2843,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,"Depends on your habit.  I was a very VERY heavy H user and tried Kratom for WDs a few times.  I always took copious quantities and it never produced a high, but it gave me some relief (again, in massive quantities) for an hour or few.  Really depends on your tolerance and habit.

One of my dealers was actually one of the early Kratom distributors in the US so I used to get it for free when I requested it when I was copping.  That dude ended up paying an undercover agent a kilo of blow to kill his business partner, though, so that connect dried up fast."
2844,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,"Once you’ve got a habit it gets you good enough to go to work, that’s about it. I’d honestly take gabapentin over it. But gaba + Kratom and I’m pretty legit, can enjoy family and friends."
2845,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,why not just do an actual proper taper instead of this shit seriously??

2850,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,I got off bupe using kratom and had no withdrawals but now I'm addicted to kratom. Might work if you could actually quit after a week or two
2851,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,Yeah. I did this it worked for me but I didn’t use over a week. I got a gram and just rode it out. Took the edge off and used as little as possible tooting bumps until I was out.
2852,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,If your an addict it would be very hard not to develop another habit using this method.  I suggest getting some gabapentin really takes away withdrawal without starting another opiate habit.
2853,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,"Yes.  I could never get thru the bupe detox even at 1mg a day. I always used dope for while then detoxed from the dope. Even though the low dose bupe detox isnt as intense (id say it was like 50-60% intensity as a good dope habit detox) i just couldnt take the 2-3+ weeks of it.  Ive actually never known anyone to take subs longer than a week then taper off em n stay clean. In almost 20 years of using idk anyone to do it.  

My one sub doctor actually quit taking new patients for subs becsuse in like 8 years of prescribing subs he never had someone taper down and jump off them. He trulywanted to help people and every sub patient either failed drug tests or quit going when tapered down to 2-4mg"

I’m curious if you have ever looked into dissociatives for pain(ketamine, pcp or RC dissos) imo they are incredible for pain and can slow opioid tolerance if you use them together. They can be difficult to use and function if you aren’t experienced but I reckon they would be great just to switch things up every now and then cuz they actually stop you from feeling pain, rather than stop you from caring about the pain like opioids, and they don’t produce physical dependence.

Just food for thought cuz I know some people use 3ho-pcp and 3meo-pcp for pain."

2878,Is OD’ing painless?,Nope it's painless. Until you wake up under an emt who just hit you with narcan and is screaming in your face and you have no idea what's going on but you feel fucking terrible and everyone around you hates you for doing that to them and the emt finds your needle in and sock and tells your mother then you spend the next few hours in pwds probably at the hospital just for them to treat you like shit and then you walk home in withdrawals and sit outside your house til someone let's you in?! Oddly specific. Yes. I know.
2879,Is OD’ing painless?,"It can be, it depends on a lot of things

There’s also a chance you’ll wake up being hit with narcan by EMS or in a hospital. Then you’ll have precipitated W/D for a while.

Life’s hard, I’m really sorry you’re in the place you’re in (if your contemplating this). Stay strong, and good luck in life, even if all you did this week was steal from your loved ones and get high I’m proud of you **life is damn hard** and it’s hard to keep going, you’ve made it this far and I’d hate for you to become a statistic in this thing"

2881,Is OD’ing painless?,"Every time I have fallen out and OD'd has been painless except for one time. That time I stayed conscious while having a seizure for about 45 seconds and then went out completely. Scariest shit of my life. 

So simple answer is yes. The act of OD'ing is physically painless but once the narcan takes hold and snaps you back awake I promise you it is anything and everything but painless."

2883,Is OD’ing painless?,"Like many others have said...painless to pass out and then AWFUL if you survive.  Sometimes pharm doses can even be off 10%+/- and I took 2.5 - 40mg OXY when my normal recreational dose is 30mg thinking I'd be really high but good....had crazy nod, passed out, and woke up violently sick, throwing up, and my head hurt so bad I was scared I was dying. The vomiting was so intense it was the only time I've ever been scared for my life."
2884,Is OD’ing painless?,overdosing is painless and peaceful but its waking up after (if you do that is) thats painful
2885,Is OD’ing painless?,100% painless and not scary at all. It's actually kind of a bummer coming back to reality.
2886,Is OD’ing painless?,"A fent tainted oxy OD is pretty painless from the people I’ve talked with. The guy I saved from a fent tainted oxy OD didn’t even believe me when I told him everything that happened. One moment he was snorting a crushed pill and he said it felt stronger than he was used to and the next he was throwing up in the sink with me supporting his entire body weight many hours after. I was lucky to be able to keep him breathing. No recollection of not breathing and turning purple, no recollection of the repeated sternum rubs, no recollection of anything. I was lucky to have been able to keep him breathing and awake. Hospital was only an option if I couldn’t do that. I’ve never been so sore or exhausted. It was hours of walking while supporting a full grown mans body weight and giving pain stimulus to keep him going. Everyone else I’ve talked to says they just black out and come to with the paramedics. The going is painless because you likely won’t remember it (but very ugly and scary) but the coming to isn’t painless and equally as ugly and scary."
2887,Is OD’ing painless?,Mine were always painless and actually peaceful
2888,Is OD’ing painless?,"It’s painless.  If you wake up, you won’t even remember it happening.  I’ve had tons of overdoses and multiple clinical deaths.

Problem with ODs, though, is they’re very rarely fatal.  Something like only 3% are fatal.  The rest of the time you wake up and when you have a severe OD and wake up, the results are often awful.

One time I woke up and my left arm didn’t work for three days, I was lucky I didn’t lose the arm.  Another time it was my left leg.  The leg went out for four days and would twitch and stomp whenever I put weight on it.  Again, lucky I didn’t lose the leg.

Even worse, I’ve lost use of parts of my face and head before too.  One time, the entire left side of my face went essentially dead.  It was hard as hell to open my eye and when I did, it was extremely painful and tears would flood down my face.  I also had no feeling in the top half of my head which was an extremely weird and oddly uncomfortable situation.

I do NOT recommend an OD and if you’re asking this because you’re considering it, reach out for help and find someone who cares and can assist you.  If you’re an addict, I know it can be hard to find such a person, but people do care about you.  If you legit don’t know anyone, fucking message me.  I’ve been there and it sucks, but your life is worth so much more."

2892,Just from sleeping on it?,"I’m not a scientist, I have no fucking idea.  I woke up with my faced pressed so hard into the carpet it was bleeding.  My face didn’t work, it hurt like a bitch to open my fucking eye and tears streamed down my face when I did.  Whenever I drank anything my throat felt like it was EXTREMELY sore.  I also had no feeling in one of my quads (still a little numb here and there to be honest) and some other shit I’m sure I’m forgetting.

Every time I OD and don’t wake up in a gown, I wake up with some weird shit and mostly shit not working.  I just champ it out every time, though, and eventually it works again...mostly.  I copped once the day after having a machete shoved into me and a bunch of my vertebrae and ribs crushed.  This ain’t an easy life, but you live with the consequences and champ it out."
2893,Is OD’ing painless?,Not always
2894,Is OD’ing painless?,Painless yes but You could also wake up as a vegetable. Gotta weigh the risks too.
2895,Is OD’ing painless?,"Yea. The most blissful sleep
Until the narcan is administered. Then all fuck breaks loose. But to OD and lose consciousness is quite blissful at first then of course you lose consciousness."
2896,Is OD’ing painless?,"Yeah when I overdosed, I didn’t even know what was happening other than finishing the test shot, I actually thought it was bunk since I wasn’t feel shit, stood up to tell my dude that in the house and that was it. 

He said he seen me get out the car, talked to his dude and looked over and I was just gone. Like wtf. Here I’m in the road/ driveway, snoring between two cars, literally about to have told dude to not buy that bunk. Woke up in the ambulance after the third narcan."
2897,Is OD’ing painless?,"It totally depends on the dose and the person, not to mention the route of administration."
2898,Is OD’ing painless?,Ya but not waking up
2899,Is OD’ing painless?,"I’ve only ever OD’d on heroin, more specifically heroin laced with a lethal amount of fentanyl. I had no idea that I was OD’ing which I’m sure in part has something to do with the nodding; because when you’re nodding you’re unaware that you’re nodding until you come out of it. I just thought I was just really high. According to my boyfriend, I stopped breathing although I have no recollection of that or anything leading up to that. He did a sternum rub (hard enough to bruise me and scrape some skin off due to my clothes rubbing against my skin) and I didn’t feel a thing. 

The painful part was being narcanned honestly. I was narcanned twice by my boyfriend. Instantly I felt insanely nauseous, extremely cold and claustrophobic as hell. Felt like everything was closing in. I couldn’t walk and had a hard time talking or typing (I was trying to look up OD’ing symptoms of heroin and couldn’t spell for the life of me). I was made suddenly aware of my breathing which was incredibly shallow and chaotic. One second I was breathing very slowly and the next I was gasping for air. It was the shittiest I’ve ever felt in my entire life, so shitty that it’s turned me off of heroin altogether. It was traumatic in more ways than one. If it weren’t for being narcanned, I can honestly say that I probably would’ve just died without ever having known nor felt a thing."

2901,Is OD’ing painless?,"Read on the bocthed US executions. 20 minutes of hell whilst the muscle relaxant slowly chokes you but doesn't allow you to show it and the chemicals burning around your pulmonary system.

Apart from anything else if it contains acetaminaphin that's a three-day slow death from liver failure.

Closest I've come is from alprazolam and not noticing a kitchen cabinet door was open. Hit it front on, broke my wrist on the way down and hit the back of my head on the floor. An inch or so from a countertop which would have killed me.

I still have the hollow on my forehead from the haematoma.

Whatever it is, it's not worth it. Take it from a dude who was in screaming agony for 7 years, no one believed me and I was taking 800mg codeine and 12 grammes of ibuprofen every day for years.

Two surgeries later, yes I'm out of work, but I have a family who support me, a wife you'd do anything for me and the buprenorphine keeps the beast at bay. Never getting off them just gone back up to 8mg from 6mg this week as I couldn't take the drop.

My wife works with those waiting for a heart and/or lung transplants who'd kill for what you have now. If you OD your organs are trash."

For first few weeks you do go to the doc 3 tines a week and if you give 8 weeks clean your put on the local GP who tests randomly,some dont bother and give you 4 weeks of scripts.  And i think its just cheaper to keep people on it. 
Its very addictive and dangerous to people with low tolerance.
60 mls would kill lots of people. In on 65 and its the fear of WDs that stalls most  from getting off.
If your on it not too long and do it with doctors help it can be done.
Its not impossible so dont let me scare you into not doing whats best.

Not lean though, tablet form, but combined with promethazine makes for a nice feeling. It is an overall weak opiate, and so that's why most people don't really care for it, but as someone who has also used oxycodone, I personally prefer codeine to it. At the end of the day, people have preferences."
2948,Codeine...what am I missing?,I knew some people hella into it. I couldn’t get past having to drink a whole big cup just for a high so I only sipped on it but didn’t feel anything

I couldn’t get past having to drink a whole big cup just for a high so I only sipped on it but didn’t feel anything,When I took it we just took whatever ml dose for the desired effect. Not necessary to be adding sprite and shit. I think it silly to be sipping on it.
2950,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"its basically like a stronger version of tramadol. sort of like what morphine is to codeine. actually ive never tried it but only because tramadol gave me seizures so i was afraid to try this. if its anything like tramadol though, its probably nothing to write home about. you will get high but be careful because it has ssri properties and could possibly give you a seizure at higher doses esp. if youre on an ssri anti depressant."

2954,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"I found them okay. Decent for pain. If wanting euphoria or recreational value, there’s little. I found it stronger than tramadol but akin to it.
If you take high doses it can be dissociative or deletion inducing.
Just my experience"
2955,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"I am one of the rare ones who actually really like trams...  200/250mgs, and I feel happy, & energetic.. also, the affordability factor is also a positive!  I've only tried tapentadol more recently, got 20 of em for dirt cheap 👍,  I've read a ton about higher dosages causing seizures, so I tread lightly (for me this meant I.Ving one tablet, popping 2 begin) I was dope sick at the time, but I will say, they absolutely took away all of my w\ds👍 but I can't definitively say I'd rate them Superior to tramadol... Hard to compare, as I've had sooo many more trams, and taken them for recreation & pain, when I'm sick the line between feeling better\getting high gets blurry! I am guilty of over indulging when I'm sick and jumping from w\d to falling out w\little in between.. lol. If they don't break the bank, I'd recommend;)"
2956,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"I have tried tapentadol a few times as well as tramadol. I do not like tramadol at all, because of the serotonin effects and weak MOR agonism. It's the only opioid I will always refuse, so far. I found tapentadol a completely different beast and very pleasurable. Stronger and much more of a proper mu opioid agonist than tramadol. I think the biggest dose I had, with little tolerance at the time, was 100mg orally, which was quite strong for me. Went into a very pleasant deep nap."
2957,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"tramadols older, hotter, more ripe cousin IMO. i loved tapentadol before i wrecked my tolly. also helped my pain fwiw"
2958,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"The only time in my life I’ve had auditory hallucinations was once on tapentadol.

It was warmer than tramadol (and more potent) but my tolerance was high enough at that point that I didn’t get very high from them."
2959,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"That’s Nucynta homie.  It’s sort of like Tramadol, but stronger and a lot less side effects (and risk of side effects).  It’s strength is around that of Vicodin I believe, might want to double check that, but it produces a high most similar to a weak Oxycodone.

I’d say go wild.  They can be fun, especially if you have a low tolerance or fuck mostly with pills (e.g., if you’re a Perc or Vic user mostly you should be able to get a hit out of em)."

You know, I’m not sure. I’d like to say I’d keep my wits and do what I currently believe to be the right thing. Though,I have no idea what boat loads of money and the responsibility that corporate shareholders’ satisfaction would do to me.  I’d like to say I’d do what’s right for the overall human satisfaction or continuity but it’s not something I can accurately say. I’m not in that position yet. I’m sure everyone going there would say the same thing; “I’m not sure”. 

>	Are you ok with having to fire people, some of whom you may even be friendly with?

Yes. I’m not there to be buddy buddy. I have seen a coworkers come and go, some nice and some that deserved to be let go. It’s a game. It’s a business. You either put in work or you’re shown the door. I have no problem being a strongarm. 

I do opiates when I have them from the pharmacy. I have 3 herniated discs and a tumor located on my spine. The pain is unbearable most days and opiates are a significant help to me. They provide stability in my life and some clear moments of content. I’m not a junkie or anything but I do do opiates and I’ve come here to get more insight into the life of opiates in general. This sub has been a huge help to me. 

You too, bud! I have no problems with you asking. It was nice to wake up to and answer!"

It's unfortunate but it's true, if he felt anything he would have just felt warm bliss, and then nothing. Absolutally nothing.  It's coming out of an od that's the horrible part 
Sorry for your loss."
3123,What does overdosing feel like?,"I just OD’d 2 weeks ago. I didnt even know I was overdosing I just went to lay down and I shut my eyes and I almost never woke up. I was completely blue and I wasn’t breathing my mom luckily found me and called 911 which prompted officers to rush to the scene with narcan. They actually arrived before the ambulance bc the police department is so close to my house. If it was a mile further away I probably wouldn’t be typing this right now but I was in no pain at all, very peaceful I woke up totally unalarmed despite me almost dying to a cop standing above me holding my THC cart lol."
3124,What does overdosing feel like?,Yeah the few times I’ve od’d I’ve just woken up in hospital vomiting like crazy. Your more then likely blacked out by the time you stop breathing so you wouldn’t know your od’ing
3125,What does overdosing feel like?,Quite a few people I know have OD’d and as another poster said there is no pain. There is only the high and then nothing.
3126,What does overdosing feel like?,"You don't feel anything. I OD'ed a few weeks ago. I didn't even know I overdosed. It all happened very quickly. Last thing I remembered was sitting down.

I promised my mom not to use after this but I can't fucking do it. I am relapsing today or tommorow. I honestly feel that it would have been better if I died."

3130,What does overdosing feel like?,"Good as fuck
Edit: sorry about your friend I didn’t read the post I just read the title and answered the question. An overdose is actually really scary and confusing when you get revived. It’s a mix of emotions, confusion, embarrassment, regret, but every time I fell out I was at peace until the narcan woke me up  and then it’s a shit show."

3143,How many times per day do you dose? HALP ME BE NORMEL,So what is the end goal here? Do you want to get off completely or just cut down a lot. It seems like you are using a fuck ton of times a day. If you are trying to taper I would definitely start cutting out two times of use a week. So you use before you leave for work. Don’t do that anymore cut that one out too. Also cut out using after the 10 am meeting. If you only want to cut out one time a week that would take much longer though. So how about you cut out two times each for the first three weeks then the next two weeks only cut out one use and you will end up using when you wake up and when you go to sleep. Or just cut one more out and you will use three times a day just in case you start to feel sick halfway thru your workday. Hope this helps.

I'm always way too high at work. Falling asleep 1 minute into a meeting while standing up, nearly falling sometimes. Sometimes I'm nodded off then have one of those falling sensations, then I scare the shit out of everyone when I jolt awake in my chair. The worst was when I was in a Skype call with the IT guy and was sharing my screen, then he asked me to type some code into the console and it was just ""ipconfiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii"" and he didnt say anything for few seconds so I kept nodding off. That last one was just easy to blamed lag or the keyboard being broken. Lol.

Unfortunately I'm no longer a secret addict since my parents found the needles. They're the only people I wish never knew. I don't care if the rest of the world knows. I just feel so bad letting them down.

3164,Are new heroin users being made a lot these days? are they young? do they go str8 to heroin/fent instead of pills?,"Yes, your assumptions are pretty much correct, although the rate of new H addicts has declined due to the prevalence of OD's in the media and all the stigma that Heroin carries these days (excessive if you ask me, not referring to Fentanyl of course).

There are still approximately 1.5 Million Opioid addicts in the US as opposed to 400-500K before the Opioid epidemic created so many new & young ones, so the market will still be bigger than it has been in a long time (probably ever) but thankfully teens have less of a chance to be exposed through pills that flooded the illicit market like 10 years ago.

Of course things can change or even reverse in a decade or possibly even less time, but for the next 5 years or so it seems like the illicit Opioid user group will be pretty stable.

Infact out of my 20 or so circle of friends, one ended up straight on Heroin from other drugs like weed/coke -  I was the nerdy one who started off CWEing codeine then progressed to darkweb oxy.

Over here weed is the common drug, then cocaine. Also party drugs like MDMA.  Nobody uses Heroin or other opiates, other than the stereotype of the homeless H addict.

I left some oxy 40's in my office in work, the cleaners tidied my office and just left them on my desk. The boss came in and left a note on my desk about work, ignored the pills.  Nobody here even knows what oxy is. They were just generic painkillers to them. Here, ""illegal drugs"" are a powder or a plant.

3173,Are new heroin users being made a lot these days? are they young? do they go str8 to heroin/fent instead of pills?,"So here's what happened with me, started experimenting with pain pills at 18 but it never really became an ""addiction"" because of the scarcity. Tried heroin for the first time at 21 only because it was much easier to find and much cheaper too, and it became an ""addiction"" very quickly for that very reason. I'd imagine it would be the same for many young people. Most 18 year old kids aren't just going to experiment with heroin for the hell of it. But if they try pills first, they already know what to expect and the concept of heroin becomes way less scary.

I couldn't imagine going through a full blown pill addiction phase. Waaay too expensive. I've known people who had perc habits that cost hundreds of dollars a day"

3179,Are new heroin users being made a lot these days? are they young? do they go str8 to heroin/fent instead of pills?,I have yet to see any of my friends on anything like heroin or meth. Actually twice I have seen someone accidentally snort meth. Most people would rather just pop pills then go to something like heroin. It is more or less a moral thing.
3180,Are new heroin users being made a lot these days? are they young? do they go str8 to heroin/fent instead of pills?,"For me personally, I started using 6 or so years ago (I was 19/20) when it was easy to get vics/percs but I always preferred stronger highs and didn’t really like pills 

The first time I used I never intended to “enjoy it” or try to get lit, i grew up with dope heads in my family and was pretty hard against ever using H. But I was depressed and I wanted to die and figured that’s how I’m gonna go out. Somehow I survived that shit and it all blew up from there. 

Obv that’s just my experience and from what I’ve seen I’m the few. I’ve seen a few kids that are wild and will take anything and everything offered to them, few of them tried the wrong shit and ended up with addictions but for the most part they’ll still start with pills"

What about him? What does he have to do with you? Just because he is a dick doesn't mean you aren't.

It doesn't. 

It's not a ""wake-up call"" and it's not ""necessary."" It counterproductive and abusive. If you truly believe you sound supportive  -- and you may not; you may just be a passive-aggressive abuser -- you have absolutely no idea what the word ""supportive"" means."
3206,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"I'll throw in my 2c having been in similar situations. I think most people are correct in that leaving him and moving on will be your best bet. One is that he will probably always choose the drug before you. Two is that you're not his caretaker, it is not your duty or obligation to make sure he's safe, okay, whatever. And third, is even if he gets clean (which I doubt you've ever known him while truly clean), he may not even be the same guy you fell in love with. Drugs change who you are and how you act. When I'm clean I'm completely different from when I'm using*. And honestly, I had much better luck dating when I used heavily. More chatty, better mood, more calm and relaxed, less libido so not nervous around partners, etc. When I'm sober I'm a completely different person than that. Especially if he's using to self-medicate, finding the drugs that make him feel ""well"" might be a longer process than you're willing to stick with.

All and all, you're young, barely an adult really. You don't need to waste your time trying to save a junkie who doesn't want to fix himself. You deserve better and you shouldn't get caught up in the sunk-cost fallacy of thinking all this time will be a waste if you leave. Holding his hand can be just as harmful as leaving him outright, really depends. Bottom line is he won't get clean for you, for his mother, for his future kids, for anyone other than himself. No addict will. So let him figure it out and if he becomes a man you can love then maybe you can let him back in your life."
3207,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"you’re so so young, get away from this guy and never look back, hate to say it but he’s bad news, got no business w someone so young either. you don’t need this stress or the bullshit that goes along with it. ditch him and never look back before he pulls you into this black vortex of a lifestyle. he’s already hurt you enough. you don’t need this shit. I mean look, his bullshit has already driven you to drink to cope. stick with him and you’re even more susceptible to picking up heroin."
3208,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"honestly just reading all this made me exhausted, i dont know how you can put up with it. heroin addiction apart, he sounds like an asshole and you know it. addicts need support, but not from anyone. he needs professional help, not yours. he's dragging you down. you already know you should leave him, and he'll probably try to do some emotional blackmail to win you back. whatever happens to him after you break up is not your fault. if he was really trying to recover and be better you'd know. if he's really interested then he would do it  for himself and you can offer your friendship during this process if you still care for him anyway. then when he's good enough to be in a relationship you can reevaluate yours. with heroin involved you'll never be the main relationship. that's my advice as a recovering heroin addict"
3209,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"I really don’t see any reason why you should stay with this person; it sounds like he’s taking advantage of you, and it doesn’t sound like it’s really ever been good. It seems like you’re in the beginning of college? A lot of couples break up just bc they want to be single for college, with no serious problems (like their significant other being a heroin addict) even present in the relationship. “You the reason I wasn’t single in college!” might be big Sean lyrics but I have literally heard this said in real life as a weird insult / guilt trip.. just shows people regret that shit. I’m all for relationships but this one just seems problematic, and aside from the obvious problems everyone else is already going to point out, I just wanted to highlight that you’re at an important stage in your life. During college, you have school and your social life to focus on; if you add in a problematic relationship, you’re not going to have time for all three. These could be the best years of your life (they were for me, I’m not just repeating an annoying cliche)... don’t waste them on someone who is more focused on heroin than you anyway."
3210,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"Definitely leave the dude and dont look back. I dated a girl a lot like you (well, given the limited info I have about you) the first time I started to get strung out. That was 10 years ago, long enough that it shouldn't matter to me any more (certainly doesn't matter to her I'm sure), and I still wish I'd just broken up with her or just never started dating her to begin with. She was this bright light of happiness, genuine care for others and sweetness unlike anyone I'd ever met. I watched myself dim that light over the course of a year and didn't even realize it until a year after she dumped me finally. I've never stopped regretting it and still feel I haven't redeemed myself from it, probably never will. I cant/dont want to imagine what was going on in her head during that time. It makes my head hurt and stomach roll over. Unless you want to be dimmed too, definitely leave this dude."
3211,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"First off, I'm very sorry about your situation. I'm actually a recovering addict with almost six years of clean time, and I'm still trying to fix the relationships I destroyed. If he's already injecting it then he's not going to ever get clean until he truly hits bottom and wants to change. You're young, and it sounds like you love him. My advice to you is to tell him that he needs to get clean and sober, or you're going to leave him. I'm sure my advice sounds harsh, but I do know that I've hurt so many people when I was using drugs. I'm not a liar, and I'm not a thief. But I was both of those things when I needed another fix to prevent going into withdrawal. I've seen so many people who ruined not only their own lives, but the lives of their loved ones as well. So, I guess it comes down to how much you truly love him. I wish you the best and I hope he chooses you and his family over death and destruction."

No judgement here (on you, but definitely on him) but you have to run. He’s in the midst of active addiction, where many of us have been. He needs a lot more help than you can give him."
3215,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,Wait why is a 24 year old dating someone who turned 18 while they were dating. Little bit predatory.
3216,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,Move on. Don’t let this guy drag your life down. I know he probably seems worldly or some other bullshit - don’t let him fuck your life up. You can do better. He is living in your dorm without a job injecting heroin. Come one. Wake up!

Do not trust the VA to care for your loved ones, stay vigilant. 
""But hey..,wtf  do i know?"";)
 Now, if you will excuse me...I have a rig to tend to.",Damnnn I had no idea. Sorry to hear that. I’ve just met a few veterans where I live and they got oxy pretty easily and was just surprised by that. Opiate prescriptions r very strict where I live but not unreasonable. I had a kidney stone and they gave me 10 hydros which was more than enough bc the pain came back one time. That being said the did the whole xray to see if I actually had a kidney stone before prescribing anything.
3230,"For my American friends, just how hard is it getting a doctor's prescription for an Opioid amidst the Opioid crisis?","Yeah it's VERY difficult, I'd much rather risk ordering a month supply of whatever opioid I desire through the DNM than jump through the hundreds of hoops of getting one legally, and even then it's likely less than what you want/need. There is way too much stigma in the US regarding Opioids, the public needs to realize they are not even that dangerous, nor toxic to the body.

Just use your common sense and DO NOT combine other CNS downers with them. We seem to be the only country that doesn't seem to understand that it can and will kill you."

I have to take kratom now and it’s fucking with my hair (it increases ur immune system and I already have a good one so my body is attacking hair follicles) and who knows what it’s doing long term. It Probs has lead in it. Gonna have cancer. All bc a doctor and govt doesn’t want to give me some oxy lol.
3232,"For my American friends, just how hard is it getting a doctor's prescription for an Opioid amidst the Opioid crisis?","I’ve heard it’s difficult but my only personal experience is that friends still get a couple Vicodin for root canals, so there’s that..."

3234,If you relapse after seven days off heroin will you withdrawl?,Probably not. Mentally it might stick with ya. Most people who relapse.. Use again the next day or day after that and are back to the races. Try not to be another statistic. Or at least make another week!
3235,If you relapse after seven days off heroin will you withdrawl?,A good possibility.ive went back into wd after 10 days ..
3236,If you relapse after seven days off heroin will you withdrawl?,"If you had a decent habit before that, yes unfortunately you will. It won't be exactly like starting over but IME it'll push you back to day 3 or so if you went without anything for 7 days. It's not worth it."
3237,"If you had a decent habit before that, yes unfortunately you will. It won't be exactly like starting over but IME it'll push you back to day 3 or so if you went without anything for 7 days.

3238,Yeah I mnot going to. I also did subs for 4 days and stopped I’m counting that in the 7 days.,"I think the subs are still slowly leaving your system, or they have just about left.   So IMO if you used once, you have a very big chance of putting yourself back in withdrawals.

It won't put you back in Day 1 so you have to do it all over again (that is a myth - or tapers would never work)  - but it will set you back enough you'll regret it.

TBH I was 11 or 12 days completely clean once, and I relapsed on day 12 - and on day 13 I still felt a little bit icky and unwell.  After 1 dose.  I'd wait at least 2 weeks."
3239,If you relapse after seven days off heroin will you withdrawl?,"That is super dependent on how long you used before, how much you usually used/used again when relapsed, etc.

Also, relapses happen. Please don't beat yourself up, and keep going forward with sobriety if that is what you wish :)"
3240,"That is super dependent on how long you used before, how much you usually used/used again when relapsed, etc.

3243,If you relapse after seven days off heroin will you withdrawl?,i would cause i would use again the next 3 days at least after the relapse
3244,i would cause i would use again the next 3 days at least after the relapse,I would only do it once tho cuz I don’t have money to get more anyway
3245,I would only do it once tho cuz I don’t have money to get more anyway,Not worth it.

3271,Avoid sweating massively when on opiates?,Also the sweating is caused a combo of our temperature regulation being fucked because thats just what opiates do and also I assume slight withdrawal caused by the drug leaving your body when your busy doing other things the only way to stop it is to stop doing oxy Im pretty sure

Anyway back to your question. I found this with a pretty quick Google search. Maybe try some Benadryl?

""Opioids: Opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone and Dilaudid are a well-known cause of excessive sweating. Why? Opioids stimulate a type of immune cell known as mast cells that release histamine, the same chemical involved in inflammation, and that in turn leads to sweating."" Jul 31, 2018"

3285,Anybody else have nightmares?,I've had sleep paralysis and night terrors ever since I spent a bunch of time in the hospital watching my daughter's body give up. After the first week or so staying in that room since her mother wouldn't/couldn't it started to really fuck me up. Enough dope puts me out enough if I do dream I sure as hell don't remember it.

Ultimately what’s the point in dating if you don’t have some sort of thought about a future together, and unfortunately it’s usually next to impossible to change somebody you love that’s in active addiction. Wether realizing it or not, you are inevitably going to come second always, I just hope you figure this out on your own without needing to be stung first. Just my opinion though!"
3298,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,"Honestly, don’t try talking to him about anything serious, or having any prolonged discussions, while he’s in withdrawal.  Withdrawal completely fucks with your mental state and brain chemistry so he’ll be in rare form and likely won’t be able to convey any real feelings, just artificial anger and depression.

Save the serious shit for when he’s dried out.  During withdrawal, keep things superficial and short.  I know that when I’m in withdrawal, it’s hard for me to even hold a superficial conversation and I often get pissed off just having to engage with people for any prolonged period of time."

3300,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,Limit interaction with him.  Wait for him to initiate contact if possible.  Don't put up with any bullshit abusive treatment though.  Just because he's miserable doesn't give him the right to lash out at you for nothing.

3312,"Any reason why they won’t potentiate? because what I’ve read and heard is that antihistamines potentiate opiates hence the promethazine in lean. 

Cheers mate ❤️","They don't ""potentiate"" what they do is make you more sleepy and it makes you nod off more easily. But it's not a technical potentiator. Technically potentiaters fight for the same enzymes in your body, which makes your blood plasma level of the medication go up. What you're talking about is more polypharmacy sedation.
Edit...cant type"
3313,"Any reason why they won’t potentiate? because what I’ve read and heard is that antihistamines potentiate opiates hence the promethazine in lean. 

Cheers mate ❤️","They do not potentiate in the pharmacological sense. A true potentiator inhibits or induces the livers enzymatic system in one way or another. E.g the typical one grapefruit juice (white being best for furanocourmarins) which affects the P450 cytochromes of 3a4 and 2d6, these are the most common for metabolising opioids etc.

Antihistamines can have a synergy, where for example your morphine (enzymatically produced from the Codeine) is made more sedating accompanied with Promethazine etc. Personally finding synergy in combinations is far more common and usually results in great results. My favourite being gabapentoids with Opioids.

Hope this helps!"

I am on day 9 now of only taking codeine (360mg 3 times a day),  last night I took 360mg didn't feel it at all.  This morning I took my 360mg and I actually got fairly high off of it - yet I was still chilly and achey.  The brain is just a wierd thing sometimes."

If you get prescribed too much the government can cut you off from a doctor and the only way to get strong pain killers is through a free drug rehab like AODS. I get suboxone through mine.

For many of us, there is nothing positive about 99% of our lives. If we can't share 99% of our lives in a forum that is designed for us, then there is something wrong.

Yes, a lot of drug addicts are liars and thieves. This is the truth. Do we belong in prison? Hell no. But many of us live a pretty miserable existence, and this forum is (was anyway) an outlet for many of us to be open and honest without having the need to hide who we are like we do in every other aspect of our lives.

Someone either has a huge vendetta against you that they cannot get over for some petty shit or just doesn’t have a life and didn’t like what you said one time. I’m not sure if the MOD team has any ability of seeing who down votes us, but if they do this warrants an investigation. The whole voting karma thing is all about up voting a comment you think adds to the conversation or downvoting a comment that takes away from the conversation or is irrelevant. Going through your comment history truly upset me and made me sad. I really wish and hope something can be done about it. Also, I decided to take it upon myself and upvoated all of those comments that were zeros or in the negative because fuck whoever is doing this to you! I really hope you don’t let it get you down, though I’m sure it’s hard for it not to. But it would be a truly big loss if you decided to stop participating here all because some immature asshole has a stick so far up their ass they’ve lost any sanity completely. I’m always around to chat if you ever want to DM me and I will always be on your side so let’s go change the sub together! 💖😜","Yep. It's above & beyond the whole, ""downvotes aren't mean,"" statement. It's severe harassment. It's been going on for over two years. I'm very over it.

>The whole voting karma thing is all about up voting a comment you think adds to the conversation or downvoting a comment that takes away from the conversation or is irrelevant. Going through your comment history truly upset me and made me sad. I really wish and hope something can be done about it. 

The MOD team can't see who is doing it, but the admin team can. I have communicated with the admin team about it in the past but there isn't much they can do and this has been an issue for a long, long, long time. You are right. Someone is very petty and has some unreasonable vendetta against me. That's all I can imagine in regards to it.

>Also, I decided to take it upon myself and upvoated all of those comments that were zeros or in the negative because fuck whoever is doing this to you!

Can I just say WOW?! You did an amazing job, I scrolled through my profile and it looks like you basically fixed it. How long did you spend doing that!? I appreciate it so much. 

>I really hope you don’t let it get you down, though I’m sure it’s hard for it not to. But it would be a truly big loss if you decided to stop participating here all because some immature asshole has a stick so far up their ass they’ve lost any sanity completely. 

I typically don't let it get me down and still participate a lot here. It can be upsetting though when I have something important to say and it gets buried. I also think there's a ""voting mentality"" where if people see a few downvotes they jump on the bandwagon and contribute to it by downvoting, and if people see a few upvotes they contribute to it by upvoting...

I don't know, but it is what it is, if anything can be learned from it, you get farther in life when you're respectful of others. I'm a huge believer in Karma. I've been through a lot. Some of it has been self-inflicted and I take responsibility for that. However, it seems I've got a lot of good karma headed my way.

3447,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,"I think a lot of people internalize the stigma that is placed on them by non-addicts and in turn demonize fellow addicts. When people are treated like the bottom of the barrel, sometimes they react by wanting to feel like there’s someone beneath them too. (Could be in part a control issue here). I’m not excusing this behavior or condoning it by any means, simply trying to examine where the hate is coming from. I also think it’s entirely displaced anger since we cannot always get mad at those who put us down or fight back against the loved ones who think little of us so we come onto Reddit and unload here. You also make a good point about how often times anonymity makes it easier for us to be much more hateful when you do not have to suffer any consequences for your actions since no one knows your name and you don’t risk losing  any kind of reputation. There is also the fact that drug addiction itself is tiring and hardening. I have experienced people’s wrath simply bc they were WDing and obviously bitter about it and needed a proverbial punching bag. 

That said, I do believe that as junkies/opiate users, we should strive to be nicer to one another as this life is difficult enough without us dragging each other down. 🖤❤️🖤"

It lead to me thinking that it was all my fault. And inevitably we ended up using together cause I was too weak to say no. The relationship ended horribly and we don't speak anymore. Took some time to get over it all due to some circumstances that were out of my control.
3540,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"I think it's 100% up to you to be honest, or you dont have to be, but at that point what's the point of being with someone you can't trust and share your life with...? 
Maybe initially I wouldn't bring it up on the first date, but I've never lied about my use to my long time girlfriend. She inspires me to do better. I look up to her because she's growing as a person and it makes me want to change. I started using fairly young, myself and was lucky enough to have a supportive family/girl who I can trust.

I've felt guilty about letting her ""party too hard"" but at the same time accept responsibility to the fact that I am the source of these party favours and it's up to me to keep her safe if I'm doing anything w her. You have plenty of options, good luck homie."
3541,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"**Start getting shit done and it won't matter!** I'm a decade into this. First just weed and pills for five years and then suddenly im doing oxy and banging street dope for another five, grew weed and did crime to feed my habit(not in the US, Im European), but you know how it goes.... I met a girl, and she got me straight.... No, not sober. She is though.  But I promised that I will never ever again commit a crime that harms another person physically or financially. She's tried to make me quit several times, but it never works for long. My longest is a month. This just seems to be how Im wired (I know its because my brain is fucked up from all the dope, spare me). So anyway I'm still doing drugs whats my point here? My point is, that is it really your addiction thats stopping you, or is the addiction just an excuse for you to not do anything else. because the dope helps you not care about what a loser you are? Really ask yourself. Why are you not doing anything with your life? is it because all your time is spent chasing drugs and shooting up? Well that is straight up bullshit. I am just now finishing a college god damn degree, from a good school no less, right now and I am a stone cold crazy speedballin' junkieman, and if I can do it, anyone else can. You will feel better about yourself and your life once you start getting things done! You'll rely less on drugs, and maybe eventually reach some kind of stability? Maybe start slow and just go outside for walks or something each day, get a shit job or something, just do something *besides* dope.

Your girlfriend will love you for it. And if she really does love you, she will be angry with you and there will be fights, but she won't leave as long as you try. Once you stop trying they're gone, man. You can have a good relationship with someone who does not use, as long as you put in the same effort they do but thats just every relationship. If one person isn't putting in any effort in that relationship it is DOA.  You also don't lie about your use constantly. You can never lie about it really, you have to be as honest as possible. Just tell them that you're noddy because you did H not because you're sleepy, just fucking say it. They will be mad but telling them is far better than lying and building up that poisonous doubt. If you are doing things in your life that are not just drugs then you might just be fine. My relationship works because my girl understands that i have serious anxiety issues that have to be treated some way, and the medical system has fucked me over so bad i refuse to see a doctor and so i ""self-medicate"". I also have pains from various injuries and a bad back. So she knows about the opiates and the benzos and has tried to get me to quit but she has kind of given up. I mean, i cause no trouble, I am always good to her, and I work my ass off both at work and school, do my absolute best to at least appear sorta normal around her and she appreciates that. However, sometimes I just splurge and will be a mess, but If all I did was lay around and shoot dope like i did before i met her... she would leave immediately.

So sometimes i choose and embrace the dirty junkie that i am, and at others i try to focus on more productive things, like higher learning. See, i think this is the problem and one huge mistake, an assumption that people make that you can only be either or. You're either a dirtbag do nothing junkie, or you hold down a decent job and have a functioning life with a wife devoid of anything that might accidentally be pleasurable. Me, i happen to have accomplished something inbetween as far as it seems, though its likely that i will die of some sort of overdose at a young age, i do combinations of huge doses of stuff that should kill me, like at least oxy 180mg crushed, some ketamine, alotta benzoz and at least a handle of whiskey, all at the same time which is mostly why my gf hates what i do, but she understands why and where its coming from, and thats just the best thing. And i respect her respecting me, by never ever doing that shit around her. Maybe that's the secret to our relationship really? idk. but if ur person doesn't like you getting high, don't get high in their presence.

But god damn stop making excuses, if you're the kind to just lay around. The only reason you haven't done something is because you haven't put the effort in, life's hard for everybody so buckle up bucko and earn that speedball at the end of the week. Think of your drug ""problem"" thats keeping you down instead more of as a ""reward system"", that you get for working hard. It will actually trick your brain, because you want that reward right... you NEED it... so go do your damn shift.

You will have more respect for yourself, and your girlfriend will respect you also, if you just keep at it and get stuff done. This isn't even some ""bootstraps"" speech, you might have a shit job your whole life... but holding that job down will mean something."
3542,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"Don't ever let the woman you love smoke heroin because you need/want more dope. You more than likely will drag her down. Unless you are actively trying to get help you aren't being fair to her. Drugs will always come before her. Especially if you're getting sick. I've gotten numerous girls addicted to pills etc just by keeping them around me. Eventually they want to try this stuff that is so important to you. The girl I ""let"" smoke heroin. She ended up linking with ""friends"" of mine behind my back and using her parents money to IV pills. I don't think she would have ever done that has she not been exposed to the scum I scored from."
3543,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"My partner has been a heavy codieine addict for 15 years. She almost destroyed us financially and probably will in the future. She lies about it constantly...but I know when she's using. She looks so ill when she's heavy using and denies it even when caught. She's tried to get help but lies to the people trying to help her. She's lied and stole from everyone she loves. It's destroyed me but I'm stuck. I hate her having this hold over me as if I tell anyone it will ruin her. We have a child and I do not know if she is safe to look after her some days. There's no talking to her about it as she is a compulsive deluded liar in fear of losing everything...and by everything I mean sometimes her next hit/fix/hand full of tablets. 

So if you're worried then there's obviously something to worry about. You will at some point have to choose. Junkie or not. Or...just find yourself a user as a partner and spiral into coma's together safe in the knowledge that you both used and it wasn't your fault."
3544,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"The short and honest answer is yes, in my opinion. It’s probably possible for it not to be in very unique circumstances, but for most cases, it is selfish.

It’s a complicated question, to be sure. Rationalizations that one is protecting the other from pain in some way are just too easy to believe in, in the face of the challenges addiction presents."

3594,CWE for naloxone?,"Its ok. The first time it was a great buzz but after 5-10 times its just ok. Feeling a bit sedated, no euphoria. Just a bit stronger than Tramadol. And once you have done the hard stuff it just helps keeping the wds at bay."

3600,How long for buprenorphine tolerance to go down?,"A few weeks atleast. Bupe tolerance builds insanely fast. I can go weeks without taking it, get high as a kite the first day, sort of high the second day then feel nothing every day after that"
3601,"A few weeks atleast. Bupe tolerance builds insanely fast. I can go weeks without taking it, get high as a kite the first day, sort of high the second day then feel nothing every day after that","This is completely wrong, bupe tolerance does not build fast. If bupe tolerance went up fast, so would your dosage when on Suboxone.  Bupe is used because you do not have to continue to increase dosage."
3602,"This is completely wrong, bupe tolerance does not build fast. If bupe tolerance went up fast, so would your dosage when on Suboxone.  Bupe is used because you do not have to continue to increase dosage.","No you’re not totally wrong. What I meant as for your tolerance going up fast, recreationally, your tolerance will build in that sense. It will still be affective for maintenance treatment, and will be useful even at a lower dose, you just won’t get high. So yeah I’m not wrong but you’re also not right."

It will still be affective for maintenance treatment, and will be useful even at a lower dose, you just won’t get high. So yeah I’m not wrong but you’re also not right.","No your wrong, your talking about half life. When using recreational opiates they have a short half life, allowing you to get ""high"" and then come down ""low"" over a period of about 8-12 hours. Bupe's half life is incredibly long, for an opiate, so, over a period of say 24 hours, one dose of bupe will keep you ""high."" Taking bupe every 4 days or so allows you to dose, get high, come down and then repeat the process. If you dose bupe every other day or every day, you don't really come down you stay in a perpetual high which after a week or so, doesn't feel like you're high anymore, it becomes your new normal. So, you remove the Bupe and you get WDs. 

The other reason bupe is prescribed is because it also has a ceiling. For me, it's 8mg or so. Meaning, I can take 60mg and feel no difference between them.
TLDR: Bupe is used because people do not have to keep increasing dosage, and because it's safe with a ceiling, preventing ODs unless you combine with something like a benzo."

So when I would take it recreationally, I’d have about 3 days I could feel it then it wouldn’t do anything but I would need to wait 2 weeks or so before I could get high off it again. That’s where the tolerance from it would be built up. It still would have an affect on me and not allow me to have withdrawals but it would need to be out of your system before it would allow you to feel high off of it again. It was also the same where after about 8mg the affect would top out and it would be a waste to take anymore, so when I would do it recreationally, I could take 30mg if I wanted and not be any more high than if I would take 8-12mg."
3605,"This is completely wrong, bupe tolerance does not build fast. If bupe tolerance went up fast, so would your dosage when on Suboxone.  Bupe is used because you do not have to continue to increase dosage.",Maybe there’s a better thing to call it other than tolerance but the quested asked was how come I can’t get high off bupe after getting high from taking it for consistent days in a row. Well because it builds up in your system fast and then won’t give you a high once you’ve reached that point. Would that not be considered your tolerance going up? I take 8mg a day and have for 4 years. I have also came off it and took it recreationally and got high the first few days then did not anymore after that.

But yeah, if you're a chipper, and 30mg oxy gets you high, 200-300mg codeine should do you right, and keep you out of SE Asian jails.

I used to get mad when I'd hear people call oxy ""synthetic heroin"", well technically they are both semi-synthetic opioids, but there is ignorance in that statement.... wait maybe not so much, because I get what they really meant now. There truly isn't much difference between oxy, opana, dilaudid, morphine, even hydrocodone, and heroin. Subtle differences yes but essentially they are all in the big leagues, the same animal, same euphoria and effects (and addiction and withdrawal) all on an equal enough level.

All the best opifam","I'm not up to date on their composition since reformulation. For the most part the biggest concern are particles under 50 microns in size as cigarette filters and cotton is essentially worthless for them. They will build up in your bloodstream (can't dissolve, but get injected and caught in small vessels), and especially places you really don't want them like vessels in your lungs. Yeah, it's fucking weird, but snorting and injecting pills will actually fuck up lungs pretty well over time. With years of it on you, I would really strongly advise doing all you can to stop further damage. It will cost you in yield and filters, not huge, but let's face it most opiate addicts aren't big on waste eh?

There is some additive common in pills that rides the line between soluble and insoluble in water, and idiots that cook their shots manage to push it over the edge into soluble territory, where it promptly precipitates in one's bloodstream. I am drawing a blank right now, but cold shots are highly important with pills especially.

Here is an excellent article explaining exactly how effective common filters are and what loss you can expect with them. It's based on MSContin, but will still apply for your situation. Biggest difference is likely to be whatever the current outer coating is, which I am not up to date on. Sorry. Strongly recommend reading the first few paragraphs at least, along with any sections on filtering methods you are willing to consider.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803777/

Ideally you would crush your pill(s) and cold water extract that, leave the solids. Then cotton/cig filter or equivalent, then wheel filter/micron filter. If you rinse a time or two you are looking at 80-90% yield of the good stuff with virtually no particulate, insoluble or semi soluble.

The cotton/cig filter before micron filter can be skipped and exists more to prevent clogging and thus accidental or frustrated bypassing/other loss.

Those little filters you are talking about, I assume I have had them before from an exchange. They are roughly equivalent to a cig filter in filtering ability but without added risks.

If you were a powder/tar user I wouldn't be stressing this nearly as much. Not if you just occasionally injected pills. Hope you look into this. That literature is useful, I promise. If you want to avoid nasty health complications 5+ years down the road the costs of playing it safe now have to be paid.


Microcrystalline cellulose isn't water soluble technically. In a basic/caustic and hot solution it does edge into soluble territory. Shouldn't be a significant issue, but with basic enough water in a boiled shot a small amount (small) is going to dissolve and crash out in the blood."

Much Love","No problem friend. Not much to do when it comes to vascular damage unfortunately. That plaque build up will be in part from naturally occurring stuff like ""bad"" cholesterol and whatnot, but be compounded with those particulates introduced. It hardens veinous tissue and kills elasticity. It creates blockages. The best thing you can do is limit further damage, and as odd as it is, mind your diet when it comes to cardiovascular health. If you get on top of it now hopefully it never results in some unfortunate bullshit like pulmanary embolism, stroke, or other nasty event. Not saying it will happen if you don't. Just that the odds really swing in the wrong direction.

I can't believe I am telling someone to mind their diet for cardiovascular health. I do a shit job on that myself. 

Thanks for caring about harm reduction. Been clean almost 3 years and just want to encourage spreading a little knowledge. No reason to be killing ourselves where it can be avoided."

Do you think I can sterilize used PTFE .22ug wheel filters i used earlier this week with isopropyl alcohol?? to use again? they are autoclavable but i have no idea where to access an autoclave.. 

Also Id like to sterilize an oral syringe that i used to draw up my shot and push it thru the filter.. does anyone think iso do the trick for me??

Cheers","Autoclaves... Only way I imagine one gets access to one of those easily is being in good with an OR nurse or tech. Anyone who sterilizes medical equivalent on a regular basis. Maybe a surgical vet place if you know someone. I'm not sure where else to look. You can definitely buy one, but not exactly cheap. Amazon and especially Alibaba have them. Possibly eBay. Probably 500 entry though.

Ovens get hot enough on cleaning cycle, 800+, to near instantly sterilize technically. With a convection fan system it would *probably* work in a second or two. That involves breaking the locking mechanism and is a fire risk (so you can open during it). Might have done that to turn an oven into a pizza oven... Not sure if the plastic will appreciate more than a flash or two either. Also not a moist heat. It would work, but it's sketchy for not health related reasons and if you are renting there will be displeasure.

Those filters are still going to clog eventually. Not nearly as fast with 2 stage filtering, but how many uses if you sterilize I just don't know. You can disinfect, not truly sterilize, with isopropyl or boiling water. The issues with isopropyl, and more so boiling water, is the rapid regrowth of bacteria. Say you kill 1,000,000,000 out of 1,000,000,002 bacteria with isopropyl. Given a 24 hour period you are back to thousands of bacteria. Used as soon as it is fully dry, the probability you are going to be fine is good, just not 100% ya know? Even enough dead bacteria can become an issue over time too, granted it takes a lot. A not great example, but it gives the picture, say you lost a Tupperware of food in the fridge for a few months. It's gross, bacteria have colonized it thoroughly. You throw it in an oven and take it up to the 600F range. Ignore that some is burned. The inside is sterile, but it's still gross and may likely make you sick. You won't get salmonella or whatever it was poisoning, but those toxic byproducts in their corpses are still there.

Point is that non live bacteria isn't entirely washing off in a iso bath when it can hide in filter pores. An oral syringe? Fine for many washes, but those tiny pores less so. 

An autoclave is just pressurized steam, so maybe a pressure cooker rigged up with some creativity is doable. Probably would take distilled water and a stainless steel rack, but if you can keep the plastic from melting it would do the same thing. Distilled because while other water will become safe through use in the process, it does have minerals etc that may build up on that filter quick due to surface are and clog and harden it. Fast enough to matter? No idea. 

Really spitballing there. I never reused them, but I had them in bulk cheap. I know some have to drop 2-3 bucks a pop which is not great. I would rig a pressure cooker into an autoclave, but only after testing how many times you can get before one clogs or tears. Is it worth the effort?

The syringe should be fine with an iso wash, but clean it after use, and then again hit it with iso before use ideally. It's not technically staying sterilized unless you can close off it's eviroment after by vacuum sealing. In theory anyway. Not sure how many would actually bother with that, but iso is near free and evaporates quick. It's how I handled my tar drip syringe when I went intranasal over IV.

Not super helpful, but maybe you can get an extra use or two out of those filters. Regardless if you find a way to sterilize I don't think they should be reused too many times. They are eventually going to clog or rip on a microscopic level I imagine. I don't have any idea where to draw that line and no literature. If you make it safe from biological hazards it is still better than no micron filter as long as it doesn't break mid use.

Sorry for the ramble, I just don't have much literature I can access on this. Bluelight is the place to try for someone who does. They had an opiate, IV, and pill subforums and some PHD packing regulars back in the day at least with dozens of threads on proper technique. Just can't recall much on reuse of micron filters."

Because of the poor venous circulation, the skin below the level of the injection sites will always be prone to breakdown and in the event of injury, even small injuries, healing time will be greatly delayed (compare poorly controlled diabetics).

OP the reason legs/feet are more dangerous is because its harder for your heart to circulate those areas making them more prone to infection as well.

3821,Long term issues from collapsed veins?,"Hey /u/OpiatedMinds! I haven’t posted on this sub in a very long time and glad to see you’re still kicking. 

Anyway back to the topic. My hands and wrists veins had accumulated scar tissue from years of IV use. Like you mentioned, my hands would fall asleep in no time if I ended up nodding out on my arms or dangling to the side. But I’ve cut back a lot since jumping back on methadone and lost connects (5-8+ shots/day to 0-4/month). I think my veins had the chance to repair since I find myself having little to no problems registering a hit and doesn’t fall asleep or get cold as fast as before.

A few years back, this one friend of mine caught my attention with how swollen his hands were for a guy who works out (was a heavy IV user but switched to smoking BTH due to no good veins). Not to be mean but it reminded me of Mickey Mouse hands lol. I’ve seen it mentioned in some articles as “puffy hand syndrome”.

3822,"Hey /u/OpiatedMinds! I haven’t posted on this sub in a very long time and glad to see you’re still kicking. 

Anyway back to the topic. My hands and wrists veins had accumulated scar tissue from years of IV use. Like you mentioned, my hands would fall asleep in no time if I ended up nodding out on my arms or dangling to the side. But I’ve cut back a lot since jumping back on methadone and lost connects (5-8+ shots/day to 0-4/month).

3823,Long term issues from collapsed veins?,"Yes your circulation will suffer eventually. It might not be life-threatening but don't collapse your fucking veins.

3829,Oxy safe to take with coke?,"There is no drug interaction but there is a danger you will take more of a depressant ( in this cause oxy ) then normal because the stimulant negates the sedative.

3847,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Are you sure they are real oxy and not pressed fent? Cause fent is probably going to be a lot rougher
3848,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Depends on the daily dose of oxy. Your activity level will most likely shorten your withdrawal duration but might not lessen the intensity. Taper down if you can and jump from a smaller point.
3849,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Just taper off.  You may not have any acute withdrawal symptoms if you do that.
3850,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Are they 5mg or 80mg? Bit of a difference. Having never been in that kind of shape myself I can only assume your detox will be 10x worse than normal

3856,Would snorting vs oral make a difference by way of bioavailability? I only snort them,"Tolerance and metabolism and bioavailability are so individualized. I would guess theoretically snorting it might be slightly less bioavailability so therefore slightly less per dose. But honestly if you've been taking 2 to 3 A-day for a while, despite the route of administration, you're gonna have to deal with their withdrawals. Maybe somebody will correct me but I can't imagine it making that much of a difference"

3862,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,"benzos just make me feel flat and depressed and drugged.  never got high off them  apart from when i first did 5mg diazepam before i had an opiate tolerance.

also since having a high opiate tolerance, weed does nothing but make me feel unpleasantly tired. it doesn't get me high at all.  when I get off opiates properly i'd like to try weed to see what it's ""really"" like."
3863,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,I’m the opposite I only feel the benzos if I do that
3864,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,Be extremely careful mixing these two. Its so easy to go over the edge with benzos in your system. Especially if youre doing dope and not just pills.
3865,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,id say because an opiate high is stronger
3866,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,Yes. It will def help. But the hard part will be when u aee totally clean
3867,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,"More times than I can tell you! You just need to take methadone at a dose that makes you feel normal for 3 to 5 days. Same dose each day.

You may need a low dose of klonopin to help you sleep -- less than .05 mgs.

That's it."
3868,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,"Yes, it worked like a boss. Best part about methadone is that you will still usually feel ok the next day as well. Space out out your doses as much as you can. A higher dose is good initially...lower it the second or third day."
3869,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,Would this method work as good with subs as methadone?
3870,What’s a high off Tramadol like?,People either love tram or hate it. You either convert it good or bad. Don’t exceed 200mg because that’s when it starts lowering your seizure threshold. Start with 100

3873,So are different brand oxy 30s different in anyway? Like m30s compared to a215 or k9s . Legally it should all be the same strength but I feel like I have favorites (k9s) is this in my head and it’s the same stuff or is there some info behind this?

Legally it should all be the same strength but I feel like I have favorites (k9s) is this in my head and it’s the same stuff or is there some info behind this? But what are your favorite ?,FDA regulation says for any medicine it can have +- 10% of the advertised dose so some brands might have more or less but it’s pretty negligible. Usually the size of the pill is what matters most to people because they don’t want to snort a bunch of powder like in the RP30s

But I arrived and apparently they went home around 6pm. Shop next to them said so. I dose late in the day. So this has left me in the shit.

Ah I was super sick by 8pm our time which was over 24hrs since my sub dose. I got a home doctor visit and he gave me a prescription for a small amount to just lesson the withdrawals over two days. Tomorrow is the public holiday so I’d be going a couple days from my withdrawals. 

I’ve only been on suboxone for 1 month so having to use tramadol isn’t too depressing. If I had been on the program for a while I would’ve been pretty upset taking them. I’ll just have to talk to this new chemist to make sure this doesn’t happen again. I’ll be doing take home dosage soon anyways. But yeah.

It sounds like you did everything possible in your power to avoid a situation like this. Unfortunately things outside your control will always happen. While the tramadol may in fact be your substance of choice, you aren't necessarily using it in an abusive manner, or as some would say in true relapse fashion lol. You are simply taking it to prevent withdrawal, just like your Suboxone. Although your rehab may definitely see this as a technical infraction, with full transparency of everything you have described to us, I believe your rehab will understand and not make too big a deal of it. If they do, in your heart you know you didn't relapse. Keep up the good work and props for not using this as a reason to say fuck it and burn it down. ✌️"

But they cannot subscribe anything. Just advice or help with WD symptoms) who said try and see if a doctor can help out for the two days because I’ve been following all the right steps and no need to put myself through WDs if it’s 2 days. Just to not go overboard and I need to make sure I speak with the chemist to make sure this doesn’t happen again just so I don’t have the needless stress of a dumb situation. 

Thanks for the kind words tho mate. Cheered me up"
3889,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,"No. You'll be fine. 

As long as there is a bit of sub in your system still, you will not be at risk for precipitated withdrawal 

Also, tramadol is atypical in its opi effects, and can be taken concurrently with subs"
3890,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,yes. you can dose your sub as you normally would. two days isn’t a long enough time period for all of the bupe to be removed from your receptors. as long as there is bupe still in your system you’ll avoid any pwds that could possibly occurre otherwise. unless you’re a freak of nature.

3911,I finally got my hands on some kratom after day 3 of WD. I also have some zanaflex. Should I mix them?,If you’re on the third day a 4-5 gram dose of kratom should be plenty.  Inbox me if you have any other questions.
3912,I finally got my hands on some kratom after day 3 of WD. I also have some zanaflex. Should I mix them?,"2mg zanaflex tablets are rather large for such a small amount of active compound, so snorting tablets doesn't seem like an efficient method of delivery. Although a nasal spray is in trials and does have higher bioavailability due to the bypass of first pass metabolism, it requires pH buffers and absorption enhancers. But back to your question, I'm assuming that you chose a red strain of Keaton as your intended use is to control WDs. Zanaflex however administered, will likely add to the sedative effects of a red vein kratom but not much else. I have not tried this combination, but I have mixed kratom with baclofen, benzos and phenibut, and found them to compliment each other nicely. For me, 7g kratom with 1mg Klonopin hits the sweet spot. If your goal is simply to potentiate the effects of your kratom, you should first consider mixing it with grapefruit juice adding about a tablespoon of turmeric and a large pinch of black pepper. Ginger is also an effective enhancer and will help within a nausea you may experience from the kratom. These are much cheaper and more available options then the zanaflex you're attempting to use. If you insist on trying your zanaflex and kratom combination, I would at least add the ginger turmeric and black pepper mixture to control the stomach pain you will inevitably experience. Best of luck"

Ginger is also an effective enhancer and will help within a nausea you may experience from the kratom. These are much cheaper and more available options then the zanaflex you're attempting to use. If you insist on trying your zanaflex and kratom combination, I would at least add the ginger turmeric and black pepper mixture to control the stomach pain you will inevitably experience. Best of luck",I guess we are talking about different things here. Its TiZANidine and the 4mg tablets are smaller than my pinky nail
3914,I finally got my hands on some kratom after day 3 of WD. I also have some zanaflex. Should I mix them?,"A magnesium supplement would also be of benefit. Personally I recommend magnesium gluconate however magnesium citrate is more readily available and much more affordable. Natural calm is a blend of magnesium citrate and citric acid that you can get at most health food stores or Amazon. I would be careful with magnesium supplements if you're prone to diarrhea, however as kratom can cause constipation it might be of benefit to you"

4112,How many days can you take subs with out feeling wds from them when you stop?,I don’t understand your question if your an active addict and you switch to subs you will withdrawal if you stop taking them just as you would on heroin. If you aren’t a junkie there’s really no reason to take subs more than once in a while for a high that just makes you want regular opiates anyway. But if you’ve already been taking them anywhere from a few days to a week +  of taking them everyday will you begin to feel withdrawal. The thing about it is it’s hard to gauge if your withdrawing from something if your not already knee deep in an addiction. I didn’t think I had any withdrawals at all the first few months of doing tons of perks everyday most days it was almost a year before I could recognize I was in clear cut withdrawal. Times before that I’d feel funky or lethargic but I wouldn’t attribute it to withdrawal but looking back i know now it was the beginning  of wds

I forget the allowable percentage of variation...not sure about he 2% but nonetheless, once I found out about it then it was feasible that one brand might have more oxy per pill than another. Now, whether that variation would be enough to notice or not, I don't know. But 2% adds up across a few pills..",Yea funny because it's more powder .. When I look bacj on it .. I never liked Ms I loved As
4124,Best 30's ? or does it even matter,"if you snort then yea it matters. some people like more powder some people like less powder, so you could have a preference on the size of the pill. they use different fillers or different amounts of them which alters the sensation of it going up your nose and the taste of the drip etc. so youll have a preference there. like someone already said theres an allowable 2 or 3 mg + or - on each pill so its entirely possible certain brands could tend to be on the low side and others on the high end. theres also placebo, if you really believe its the best it probably will be. none of em slap like an e8 imo"

4129,Tips for hiding it when you’re high?,In my experience you just have to learn how to ignore the hard feelings from those close to you. If we were talking about strangers maybe it would be easier to hide but with people close to you it can be almost impossible. Just my 2 cents.
4130,Tips for hiding it when you’re high?,"if you make it a decade or 2 of using, you won't have to worry bout hiding it because the dope barely does anything after years n years.

But at least eventually if you keep with it long enough youll have so many tracks that you can just blame it as old marks. Give it a decade or two and new pokes will just blend right in

Have you looked into Kratom at all though? It worked really well for me for my adhd and social anxiety, its cheap, u cant OD, u dont have to wait on any dealers etc, and more importantly it wont take your soul. The key is LOW doses. .5-2.5G honestly improved my life and gave me lots of energy. It does keep the door open though as far as opioids in your brain.

1) id need to start w 7gram doses 3x per day and taper down 1 gram per dose per week likely.  Kratom powder can sludge up your liver and go tract at that much.  But it’s totally doable and I believe I can be successful there
2) more importantly, the way Kratom binds to and saturates opioid receptors, ibogaine doesn’t have 95% success rate as it does with traditional, whort acting opioids like oxycodone, heroin, morphine.  I’m 100% committed to my I Ogaden plan, pre and post treatment for coaching, integration and long term abstinence.  I plan to implement Victoria after ibogaine sets me free and repairs the opioid receptors and the brain damage I’ve caused to my natural serotonin firings.  

So that being said i can go on Kratom, large doses, and likely still have to deal with a min level of wd, and then switch back to oxy 2-3 weeks before ibogaine treatment and healing

Or

I can just taper my current supply of oxy blues, change from snorting to oral, get down to 45-60 mg per day “coasting dose” then kick and heal completely with ibogaine.  

Or yet so the same above but after I taper to 45-60 jump on kadian for a few weeks until ibogaine.  Leaning toward this option.  

I have to remain fully functional and top of my game the next 3 months to get my businesses crushing before I leave for Mexico for 3 weeks:  I’m willing to put in the work.  I just know myself by now and what will likely works best is the taper/kadian/ibogaine.

Anyone have success or experience with these options?’

4154,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"Jesus where do I start. I spent more time *in* withdrawal than I did high for a really long time and worked out a system that wouldn't make the WD's go away but make them tolerable.

Tools:
* Loperamide
* Trazodone
* Klonopin or any benzo
* Food (sweets are good)
* Drinks
* Nicotine (important)

So Loperamide by itself will help with WDs immensely if you take enough. No, it will **not** cause your heart to flip upside down and start to die. Not in the amounts I take. I take 20, 2mg pills and wait 2 hours then take 10 more if I need it. It takes 2 hours to work so wait it out.

Trazodone is pretty decent at getting you to sleep if you're taking lope too. By itself, it will put you to sleep if your WDs are mild, but if in full blown Opana or Heroin wd, traz wont be enough.

Klonopin/Benzos are a godsend. Basically, life is worth living again with benzos alone but mixed with lope, its a sure thing.

Food/Drink and Nicotine - Basically, after you eat a lot of food you tend to get sleepy and when in WD, sleep is hard to come by. If I'm allowed to sleep whenever I want throughout the day (like on the weekend) the second I feel remotely sleepy, I go to bed. 

I can increase the success rate for this by timing my eating and drinking along with any form of nicotine. So say, I'll force down some ice cream or pasta or any heavy carb meal and then when I start to get that sedated feeling 30-40 mins after eating, I'll smoke or vape heavily and within 5 or 10 mins I'm ready to try to sleep.

Even with benzos I've been in withdrawal so bad that I still can't sleep and aren't willing to take 3-5mg of xanax with no tolerance just to try to sleep. That always scared me.

I don't always have benzos but usually have trazodone and lope and between them and some well timed meals and some ahem, *personal* time, I can usually squeeze out a couple hours sleep  throughout the day if I'm lucky.

If I take much larger doses of lope like 30+ 2mg pills at a time my success rate goes way up but that much lope feels dirty af.

I know this is sort of a shoddy process with a lot of goofy combos. You don't need trazodone if you have benzos for instance."
4155,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"It will help, but if you are on heroin or oxy, what you need is a few days worth  -- 3 to 5 days -- of methadone at a dose that makes you feel normal.  You can bypass or at least seriously reduce acute withdrawal symptoms that way."
4156,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,Help
4157,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"Benzos are what gets me though. I couldn’t have switched from methadone to Suboxone without them.

Magnesium and other supplements are good. Magnesium helps with muscle aches and cramps. Eating well, drinking lots of water. If you’ve got diarrhoea or vomiting, or you’re not eating much at all, Gatorade/electrolyte drinks help.

Try to keep yourself busy, even if it’s just having something good to binge on Netflix. Have everything done so you don’t need to worry about shopping, washing, or errands.

Keeping a diary is good. Score yourself /10 for mood, muscle ache, cramps, vomiting/diarrhoea, anxiety, etc... that way you’ll see that you’re getting better over time. Also keep track of medication, food, and water.

I like guided meditations. I find it’s easier to sleep with them. I’ll link one in.

If you have a spare room, you should use that to detox. I think they say that because you don’t want to associate your bedroom and bed with being sick.

Edit: https://youtu.be/ZAJFk0RQ0J0 search ‘guided mediation and sleep’ in YouTube, it took me awhile to find voices I liked. Goodluck!"

4159,You're the best thank you. I took 10 mg about 10 minutes ago or so already feel much better. I'm on day two of wd and it feels like it will never end,"It’s awful isn’t it. Do you have enough valium to get you through the next few days? I made sure u had a decent stash of valium and Xanax. The worst was I had to go into my clinic each day. I’d feel a bit better as the Suboxone was wearing off, and the underlying methadone took hold, ...but then I’d dose at the clinic and be thrown back into withdrawals. I would have quit if I didn’t need to be on Suboxone to travel.

Here’s the form the doctors use to gauge withdrawal. It’s only physical symptoms though. I felt more in control keeping track, but not everyone would.

4177,Tips on potentiating snorting oxy?,You can’t boost bioavailability of snorting as it bypasses the liver entirely and goes directly into your bloodstream. White grapefruit juice might make the half life longer though as your liver enzymes are impaired by it and will not be able to filter the oxy out of your blood as efficiently as normal. You could also try taking 50 mg of Benadryl (DPH) as it will allow you to nod much easier and reduce a lot of the itchiness oxy comes with.

Just be prepared to start out with non-opiates and physical therapy and gradually (hopefully) working your way up to low-grade opiates etc etc .
And never EVER ask for anything specific, they’ll see directly through that and label you as a drug seeker and terminate everything. 
Also, a pain management referral is what you will eventually want/need in order to get any kind of monthly prescription. And ‘if’ you’re lucky enough to eventually get some kind of script, you will be subjected to drug tests and pill counts to make sure you’re not abusing your script and / or mixing it with other drugs. If you fail one of those you’ll also be booted.

A years worth of opiates for 500 pain patients equal to 720.000(!) doses.

The article states that he rx'd 500.000 doses in TWO years, less than 250 people per year."
4205,He shouldnt really be in jail... it just makes other docs even more scared of prescribing.,"so true. I just got told the stupid speech about how ""the gov makes it so that all narcotic pain medicine is only for the terminally ill or extreme situations like compound fractures, etc"" which is bullshit. the doc was a pussy and she was just scared. it was a follow up after an ER visit where i was prescribed percocet. i went for my follow up a few days after, got another 2 weeks of norcos that time...well the wait to get into the orthopedic surgeon is no joke and typically takes 4-6 weeks. so i made another appt. since i ran out after taking my meds as directed. i go back, explain that im waiting for the approval of the referral i was given from the same doctors office (dif doc though) and needed a refill to make it until my appt with the surgeon. NOPE!  
  
tl;dr or more like too hard to read: sorry, i finally got some bangin coke and boy today so ive been speedballing all night."

I can only sympathize with you fella, best wishes and hope you get a stable rx soon, I myself am fighting for one too for lumbar scoliosis and discopathy, its not as painful as yours but when you work your ass off in a kitchen it aint no joke either..."

hope it works out for you, watching doctors who know nothing of the amount pain you, i, or anyone else in legitimate pain are in or going through just sit there and say ""well i cant prescribe any narcotic medicaiton"" and advise some dumbass ibuprofen with ice/heat..make my blood boil (sorry for that janky ass sentence lol, been up doing speedballs all night and am starting to lack simple grammar)"
4208,Why can't I ever find these doctors?,I want him to kill me
4209,Why can't I ever find these doctors?,"i used to have a few friends with scripts from this guy..as a person...they always said he was nice af...if you came in like a junkie...yea riiiight, he'd treat you like one lol. however, one of the girls had a legit script from him....and BAM, she lost that shit when he got got and she had to go through hell and back to find a doctor who would continue her medications afterwards"
4210,Why can't I ever find these doctors?,"trust me. its one of those u wish u did but if u actually had u wouldnt be any better off. every person i know that had a illegitimate doctor ended up soo much worse off than they would have if they never had a doc. Instead almost every person I knew that had an illegal script was cut off at extremely high doses which is borderline illegal except these doctors don't really care about the law, they only care about money. this is years ago by the way."
4211,Why can't I ever find these doctors?,so he gets 40 years and what does the sackler family get????
4212,Why can't I ever find these doctors?,Can you imagine sitting at a doctors office at 11 pm. No thanks
4213,How long can i use painkillers without getting withdrawals?,"Unless you wanna be struggling with opioids forever, you should stop now. 

I wish I could go back to when it was a choice and choose to abstain. Opioids have really taken a toll on my health and life."
4214,"Unless you wanna be struggling with opioids forever, you should stop now. 

I wish I could go back to when it was a choice and choose to abstain. Opioids have really taken a toll on my health and life.",thank you for your concern. i’m not going to buy any more after i’ve taken the few pills i have left.
4215,thank you for your concern. i’m not going to buy any more after i’ve taken the few pills i have left.,"Ultimately you’ll do what you want regardless of what strangers say online. But please, hear me. 

When I was first dabbling in opioids I really liked the chill, relaxing qualities. I thought to myself, “how could something so soft be as dangerous as I’ve been told.”

I just assumed these people had weak willpower. I had zero concept of physical withdrawals. I wrongfully assumed the decision to use opioids or not was as simple as choosing tea or juice with breakfast. 

I’ve been off for about 40 days now. After 20 years of destructive behavior and habits. I’ve been off before, once i was clean for 13 months, I relapsed. Another time I was clean for three years, I slipped right back in. It’s a lifelong struggle. 

I really do wish I could go back.

Edit: clarified."

4218,How long can i use painkillers without getting withdrawals?,For me it's usually if I use for more than 4 days in a row or a week of every other day. The withdrawals aren't bad at that point but still not pleasant.

4220,How long can i use painkillers without getting withdrawals?,"Just remember, the longer you go the worse it gets."
4221,How long can i use painkillers without getting withdrawals?,"Also spreading your use out helps keep your tolerance down.  There’s a real sweet spot in between using casually and trying to ward off withdrawals. When I had little knowledge of what my limits were I took something about 6 days in a row and experienced what I imagine was minuscule withdrawals in the scheme of things. But it was a good wake up call me, cos it still sucked. Enjoy!"

4223,How long can i use painkillers without getting withdrawals?,If u take enough tramadol it’s definitely not shit
4224,If u take enough tramadol it’s definitely not shit,i agree. see a lot of people on here saying they’re worthless but for me it provides a euphoric buzz that lasts for ~12h. depends on the person though.

4226,[deleted],A guy at my homeless shelter would take 30 pills of hydro and never get a sniffle... I was amused how he couldn’t get sick despite the dosage and time he would use.
