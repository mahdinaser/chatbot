0,"I feel mild withdraw symptoms while on suboxone, is this normal?",Bro how much money were you spending on blues a day? And maybe increase to 4mg in the morning 4mg in the afternoon and then 2-4 mg at night. You’ll 100% feel better. Then taper down over ten days. Did you wait 12-24 hours after your last oxy use before taking the subs?
1,"I feel mild withdraw symptoms while on suboxone, is this normal?",You were doing ten 30's a day essentially? ROA?
2,"I feel mild withdraw symptoms while on suboxone, is this normal?","probly just barely enough to cover it.  if you can handle it, do it.  the higher the dose, the shittier it'll be to taper.  if its too shitty, like the other guy said, 4mg am/2-4mg pm"
3,"I feel mild withdraw symptoms while on suboxone, is this normal?",Wow 300
4,Why does dilaudid suck for me?,You need to shoot em. Its the only way to really enjoy em
5,You need to shoot em. Its the only way to really enjoy em,I'd imagine IV use is probably extremely dangerous for someone with a low tolerance like myself. Also I'd rather just not head down that path.
6,I'd imagine IV use is probably extremely dangerous for someone with a low tolerance like myself. Also I'd rather just not head down that path.,"hes right, that's where dilaudid really shines, but you are also right, it's not a path you wanna go down."
7,Why so hard to Stay Off opiates?,I think its all individual. Some people come back 100 percent while some don't. I think our environment and lives have a lot to do with it. For instance if youre homeless or have always been depressed then it may be harder to enjoy sober life with nithing to look forward too. But if youre a successful person with a good job and family.. When you get clean you may truly enjoy it and have motivation because there is morr to enjoy. It's also important to try and progress when you're clean. My problem was id be clean for a couple months but still just sat at home all day doing nothing on my phone ans was depressed. We have to push our comfort zone and get out! Thats how oppotunities come and things can change in your life. Best of luck bro
8,Am I overdosing?,"Youre high, if you were overdosing youd be unconcious. 

Using is like swimming, always go in with a friend, its stupid to go in alone."
9,Am I overdosing?,You are fine. Looks like you've hit that sweet spot. Enjoy it
10,Am I overdosing?,Getting on Reddit was a sign each and everytime I was overdosing
11,Anyone remember Nubain?!?,It's unscheduled internationally so it can be acquired from certain online sources still.
12,It's unscheduled internationally so it can be acquired from certain online sources still.," So I've heard, it's also available on gyms too..I'm sure those guys are probably ordering from online sources though lol"
13," So I've heard, it's also available on gyms too..I'm sure those guys are probably ordering from online sources though lol",I've never heard of this. I'm not an opiate user but I use steroids and body build.
14," So I've heard, it's also available on gyms too..I'm sure those guys are probably ordering from online sources though lol",Butorphanol was another one used in a similar fashion.
15,Anyone remember Nubain?!?,"No, but I remember Talwin from around that time."
16,Anyone remember Nubain?!?,"Nubain has pretty much disappeared from the US. It seems like there is still an issue with Nubain addiction in Pakistan, bizarrely."
17,Anyone remember Nubain?!?,Sounds like another garbage partial opioid similar to suboxone/buprenorphine.  Its a partial agonost and partial antagonist which means it acts like narcan when you take it after using other opiates and puts you in precipitated withdrawal.
18,Sounds like another garbage partial opioid similar to suboxone/buprenorphine.  Its a partial agonost and partial antagonist which means it acts like narcan when you take it after using other opiates and puts you in precipitated withdrawal.," Not at all, Nubain was great..it was a very functional opiod and didn't produce laziness or nods like harder ones..many guys were addicted to Nubain but their lives were still relatively normal and functional but when a few got on OxyContin, game changed big time"
19,Why are small pills more potent than bigger ones?,Less filler. more oxy.
20,Why are small pills more potent than bigger ones?,The 5's and 10's also know as percs can have anywhere from 325-500 mg of APAP in them where as 20s and 30s don't have any in it. Just raw oxycodone in it.
21,Why are small pills more potent than bigger ones?,"Percocet is oxycodone with Tylenol in it. Percocets come in 5mg, 7.5mg, and 10mg pills. Roxicodone (brand name) is just oxycodone hydrochloride no Tylenol. Roxicodone comes in 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg, and 30mg pills."
22,Can I drink on H?,Maybe not chug.. to xperiment with it.. drink 20 oz wait 30 minutes if you're content ride the wave.. if you hunger more down the other 20oz.

24,"But safety wise you think I'm good? I'm pretty high rn, def a case of the nods once I finally sat down and started chilling",Safety wise you're good man. Do 20 oz first.. if you have a close friend tell them to give you check up calls. That's atleast what I do if I'm doing something questionable.  You're more than safe. Use it to learn about your tolerance.
25,Can I drink on H?,U know u already will
26,Can I drink on H?,True that. But peace of mind while buzzin is always a plus
27,Can I drink on H?,Brah I’m sure you’ll just get super lit and maybe puke lmao
28,Ox oxy?,Only ox80 I've seen is toroxycon. Peel and crush or use cola method
29,Ox oxy?,You think they worth getting can get a 80 for £16
30,You think they worth getting can get a 80 for £16,"That’s a great price if that’s on single tabs. Used to pay £20 for singles of the sandoz brand, which were easy to crush and sniff.

I’m not sure about toroxycon as I’ve heard conflicted reports about them gelling up (maybe there’s two different formulas?) but most people say they’re the same as the sandoz brand.

Bulk (a box of 28 or more) it was only £10 per 80, so maybe ask about bulk prices too? But for that price I’d totally pick up one or two just to test out. At worst you have to take it orally, but that’s not the biggest problem in the world. Man I fucking miss having an oxy link so badly, but I’m glad my dealer is clean and well and raising his family now :) weird tangent sorry."
31,Ox oxy?,"Get on the onions just set it all up recently, desperate measures n all that lol"
32,"Did you know that Endorphin Deficiency Syndrome (EDS) is actually a real condition? I didn't even know this until just now. Maybe it's why I'm constantly uneasy, suffer from depression, anxiety and why I'm attracted to low-dose opiates.",Opiates help with anything. All mental and physical problems melt away. I wouldn’t say because you like opiates and they help that you can diagnose yourself. Benzos relieve all anxiety and tension which explains why they would help so much. I feel the same about benzos.

Benzos relieve all anxiety and tension which explains why they would help so much. I feel the same about benzos.,I never self-diagnosed. Just based on my medical history I said 'maybe' and I was going to look into LDN further. It would be nice if something non-addictive could actually fucking help me for once. I'm fed up.

Sadly, I'm not sure there have been a ton of advancements as far as recognized treatment options go. (that I've found anyway.)


I also gave up looking a long time ago, perhaps it's time for me to do more research 

I'm in the same area you are - I know I have it, have probably had it my entire life. I'm intolerant to CBD products.

I take low dose kratom a few times a week, that helps a little. Afraid to go any higher because I don't want any dependance to grow. 

I've supplemented with various supplements that support GABA production to mild changes. I work out a few times a week; that usually helps. I use other supplements (vitamin D, as an example) that help a little. I take supplements / try modalities that ease the CNS and address the adrenal glands. Helps, but in my case my anxiety isn't too severe. 

I've learned how to mitigate the low grade pain I seem to always hover around in with stretching, yoga, hot baths, supplements, PT, etc. 

Part of it is time and age; I've gotten older and more used to navigating the world in my body. I'm grateful for being able to have these things in my life. 

BUT - None of those things come close to opiates. 

The first time I tried opiates I finally felt Normal. Not HIGH (that came later) just NORMAL. 

That's the way I feel on low dose opiates. I feel NORMAL.

The way I want to feel, every day, is just FUCKING NORMAL. 

You kinda reinvigorating me to look at this again and dive into the medical literature and see what's new. If you find anything out there, let me know. 

I'll do the same."

I'd say my GABA is fine however, as benzos didn't really do anything positive for me.  

I wonder if people who get ""hooked"" on weed have something wrong with their endocannabinoid system?

unfortunately opiates lead to dose chasing; so I'm hoping to get clean and try out LDN if possible"

41,"Did you know that Endorphin Deficiency Syndrome (EDS) is actually a real condition? I didn't even know this until just now. Maybe it's why I'm constantly uneasy, suffer from depression, anxiety and why I'm attracted to low-dose opiates.","I think it is possible, but if you are depressed and your monoamine levels are low this is going to cause your endorphins/endogenous opioids to become low as well. SSRIs are garbage drugs that only help a minority of people; and people are constantly forgetting or are simply unaware that there are other antidepressants available out there as well. The fact that you prefer the more stimulating opioids like tramadol, tapentadol and oxycodone with tramadol and tapentadol being very strong noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors could mean that you have a problem with low noradrenaline and dopamine. Just a gut feeling but your uneasiness and preference for the stimulating opioids could be symptoms of having ADHD.

You should look into more stimulating ADs like Wellbutrin, Nortriptyline and MAOIs - and also have a psychiatrist screen you for ADHD which could give you scripts of stimulants to try as well. All these medicines will boost your natural endogenous opioid production as the monoamine system is heavily interlinked with the opioid one. If you still have cravings for opioids you could combine your AD with maybe suboxone or kratom. Oh and by the way, kratom is a great replacement for those dirty acting shit drugs tramadol and tapentadol. Unlike tramadol and tapentadol kratom can also be combined with any antidepressant including MAOIs. Probably want to avoid taking SSRIs/SNRIs/strong SRI drugs for your problems and if you already found no relief from SSRIs.

But yes I do believe that in some people there definitely is an endogenous opioid deficiency - these people probably need to be on opioid replacement therapy (ie sub/methadone) for life. If you suffer from anxiety and depression other antidepressants will be helping you as well in combatting these problems and your possible natural opioid deficient state - but some unfortunate few people may still need an opioid of course.

I would want to say though that depressed people in general probably are in a constant low endogenous opioid/endorphinic state, but for some or a lot of these people other antidepressants will raise endogenous opioids through downstream action enough to restore them to normal levels."

Edit- 1000mg x 4 daily. Not in one dose"
49,How would you use these meds to detox and quit?,"5 day sub taper going 5,4,3,2,1mg.  Use the Xanax as needed to especially during the 36hours before you induct the subs.  Lucky you got everything should need"
50,How would you use these meds to detox and quit?,"Use the subs to start idk what dose you need you sound more experienced but obviously the first day you would take the most so like 6mg and then taper from that. I would take the gaba 3x day, xanax as needed, and try to save the ambien. And hit that weed a lot, use kratom sparingly (I think it sucks anyways)"
51,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,"My favorite was a dude in his 30s who never left the hood. I’d usually drive out there, but when my car was busted he’d wait with me outside rain or shine for that bus to come get me after I’d pick up. I’m a petite and cute female, so gestures like this meant the world to me.

For never being outside the hood, my dude was a true intellect. He had this enormous bookshelf that took up an entire wall hosting a collection of heavy nonfictions and classics. Most people I know that have a collection like that have more than a few books that they’ve never cracked open, but homie read 100% of every book he had. He could tell me who wrote each book, the year it was published and it’s cultural significance.

If I were making snacks, or buying fruit, I’d always save some for this dude. We ate a lot of fruit together sitting in my car or at the bus stop. When a plane would fly over us, he’d point and rattle off its model and the year it premiered, a casual savant...

I miss that guy, the fire dope and the yapping dogs that always followed at his heels. In three years he never implicated that he wanted sex from me. We eventually would go on grocery runs together when there was only one car in between us. 

Big props to him for looking out for my safety and getting me to look to the horizon when I’d show up at his place day after day, tunnel visioned for the dope."

63,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,"My plug is seriously amazing. So much so when I tell people how great he is they don't believe me lol! We started as friends before he became my plug. As such he knows a lot about me personally. He checks up on me when he knows I've been sick or going through something. 

He always answers me immediately. The only time he's ever taken time to respond is when he is in an appointment. Not only does he answer quickly, he responds in full sentences that actually make sense. He keeps regular ""business hours"" so I can easily plan around his availability. 

He is extremely honest with what he is selling to me (pressed pills). When he gets different batches he always explains everything to me (price difference, if there are deals available, why certain batches cost more than others, etc.). 

He is super easy to meet and I can tell he is hyper-vigilant about his surroundings, just like I am. He's just an awesome person all around."
64,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,I just stay cool calm and collective like with any business transaction. Never had any problems.

Not  that my best friend happenes to be my plug, he just became my best friends over time. He fully trust me and I fully trust him. At some point he even started looking into his hiding spot for money while I was there. He know he can trust me.

He doesn't deal h though, but high quality coke and can also get his hand on pretty much anything if I ask him. He's a really good guy. We're planning on tripping on acid this week with my girlfriend."
71,Nyquil for sleep during detox?,"It could possibly cause RLS, everybody is different. For me personally when I'm in withdrawal the only thing that puts me to sleep is more opiates sadly. I've tried benadryl, nyquil, seroquel, remeron, ambien, and multiple different benzos but for me personally none of it does the trick. Most of them actually make my RLS worse even after taking something like requip on top of them to combat it. But I know a lot of people that say some of that stuff helps them get at least a couple hours of sleep, especially benzos."

""too much seafood or red meat""...lol"

79,What does the gout in your foot feel like?,"Omg it was horrid. So first my foot felt really stiff like I had a cramp I couldn't shake. Then it turned bright red, got all swollen and hot at the base of the toes! The swelling went down a bit, now it looks like a black and blue mark. Still hurts, too."

81,"I dont think thats gout... i mean it could be idk what that actually means in all fairness, but I got what yore describing when i was shooting in my feet... do you shoot anywhere under your hips?","Nope, just my arm. It's definitely gout, I've seen it in my patients at work many times. I just never heard of it happening as a result of opiate use."
82,Opiates and etizolam?,"Yup, I've tried it. I woke up in the middle of a busy street surrounded by paramedics. Definitely not safe especially because Etizolam gives you the delusion of sobriety (you think you're sober even though you're absolutely fucked up)"
83,Opiates and etizolam?,"Yeah pretty dangerous. I mean benzos are pretty safe on their own, but add them on top of any other CNS/ specifically respiratory system depressant and it can easily turn your lights out for good. That being said I used to be heavy on the opiates and could easily take 2mg of etizolam on top of my dose without any noticeable ill effects. But I wouldn’t recommend it. Opiates were just as fun without etizolam, and all the etizolam did was make me careless enough to do a little too much dope and pass out too early. Just really wouldn’t recommend it man"
84,Opiates and etizolam?,No fucking way.
85,Opiates and etizolam?,It can be dangerous when you mix too much.
86,Opiates and etizolam?,"If you take very small amounts, it's fine. The problem comes with re-dosing and not knowing how prone you are to it. We all lose some self-control when under the influence.

So, not recommended. Just stick to one or the other."
87,Opiates and etizolam?,NO
88,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,Shit forever lol how long u been using
89,Shit forever lol how long u been using,"Fuck man that’s what it seems to be for me. I quit 3 months ago. Tried to get high on prescription roxi for my birthday (not a relapse, just a planned celebratory single dose) and I snorted all 3 of the pills I bought within an hour and still did not feel high. I suppose this is because I used to use fentanyl pressed pills and my tolerance was sky high, coupled with the fact that I’ve been using kratom for maintenance. But still, after 3 months I expected to easily be able to get high with 30-45mg of oxy. But nope, not even 90mg was enough. Crazy how tolerance works. I think it depends a lot of whether you’ve been totally clean or using something for maintenance though."

92,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,"This is prolly the last thing you wanna hear but I stopped taking oxy for 2 years and tried it again after and needed around 100mg to feel anything which was similar to the dose I was taking before I quit. Idk why but my tolerance I sincerely believe will never return to normal, hope you don’t have the same problem lmfaooo"
93,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?," Honestly, when I read these tolerance questions regarding opiates, I recommend just getting off and staying off..find another drug class to experiment with as its just not worth the possible trouble..

  Once someone gets addicted or develop tolersnce, it takes several weeks of clean time before opiates regain any sort of magic ..they can still get you high but tolerance will develop at a very fast rate if you start using them with any regularity.."
94,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,Month
95,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Depends on tollerenca im sure some would die off of 120 mg
96,Depends on tollerenca im sure some would die off of 120 mg,I have used alot of tramadol so i think my tollerance would be a bit higher
97,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,"With no tolerance a 30mg amount will be perfect! Honestly you will get rocked, don’t listen to the people going above this until you gauge for yourself."
98,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Go slow with it try 40 mg if 25 was weak
99,Go slow with it try 40 mg if 25 was weak,Never tried oxy so i wondered if 25mg was enough. Also will mixing oxy with other opiates like cosylan and tramadol potentiate it
100,Never tried oxy so i wondered if 25mg was enough. Also will mixing oxy with other opiates like cosylan and tramadol potentiate it,Take 50-75mg dph(benadryl) 30 minutes before doing the oxy
101,Take 50-75mg dph(benadryl) 30 minutes before doing the oxy,Benadryl is impossible to get here. I have some antihistamines. Is oxy liver toxic? I am on alot of methyl tren now and have to be careful.
102,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,35 mg of oxy should have u feeling good chew it up and youll be vibing within the hour
103,35 mg of oxy should have u feeling good chew it up and youll be vibing within the hour,Will i nod out on such a dose?
104,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Well do youbtake tramodol everyday n how much of it do ubtake
105,Well do youbtake tramodol everyday n how much of it do ubtake,Not everyday but i have had binges and i take it whenever it is avaible. I have to take about 500mg staggered to get completly fucked up
106,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,First off do u know you can have seizures from doses that high of tram.. Second oxy is alot stonger start with no more then 25 mg
107,First off do u know you can have seizures from doses that high of tram.. Second oxy is alot stonger start with no more then 25 mg,Yeah i will try 25mg and see what happens. I really hope i nod

126,"I want to quit suboxone. I have been given all the advise on how to physically quit, but how can I mentally quit?",Its hard to quit when you totally dont want too.
127,Its hard to quit when you totally dont want too.,A big part of me does want to quit. Really more than anything. But I feel like that addict part of my brain won’t give up. Like my brain is being controlled and it’s a constant battle between what I want and what my brain thinks I want.

Like my brain is being controlled and it’s a constant battle between what I want and what my brain thinks I want.,Believe bro i know. This 4 months i have now is the longest in past 7ish years. I wanted to quit just like you. But would mess up Every time and try and justify it. Eventually we have to be honest with ourselves and admit you aren't totally ready. Just that realization made me want to quit Even more. And when I eventually did quit it was a lil different and i knew i HAD to stop. It doesn't have to happen that way. But it did for me. I always knew I wanted to quit but wouldn't act on it. The letdown you give yourself fucking hurts lol. Telling yourself. You'll quit but never do. Its no way to live life having a chemical control you like a parasite. You got this man. Have a lil faith or confidence. You know you can do this.

I'm going through the same things myself so I understand I'm just going through withdrawals of over 12+ years opiates  now on suboxone but I'm in terrible pain so I use cbd . If u get quality stuff it runs about 150.0 so that's the only issue it can be expensive also depending where u live if it's legal I'm in California.  U can always order it online. Just a though.

157,Wellbutrin as a potenator?,"A little searching yields this..

""If you take hydrocodone or oxycodone and either bupropion, dacomitinib, fluoxetine, hydroquinidine, paroxetine, or quinidine together, your pain medicine may not work as well.""

So i would guess no. Ive never heard of using it to potentiate either. Did someone tell you they do?"
158,Wellbutrin as a potenator?,Wellbutrin has a stimulant like effect so no
159,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,"Yea bud. doesnt even really matter your weight. Even with zero tolerance youd just get a pretty solid nod going with that.

Edit:
Your weight definitely matters. i just mean that even at a low weight (120lb) you wouldnt really overdose.
Im no doctor though. I just know from experience.

Stay safe!"
160,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,"We are not doctors so we cannot tell you what is safe and what is not safe. What I can say, is you can always take more, but you can never take less. So take some and evaluate how you feel in 30 minutes if you're okay, take a bit more, and so forth until you've reached your desired sweet spot. 

Also, just because it seems like you're early on in your addiction, consider quitting now. It's a lot easier to walk away while it's still a choice. That's all I'm gonna say on that because I don't want to patronize you."
161,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,Yes because morphine has a low oral bioavailability but I wouldn't take it if you're on Oxy as that's a waste imo. If you want to add to the Oxycodone you already took take 25 to 50 milligrams of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).
162,Yes because morphine has a low oral bioavailability but I wouldn't take it if you're on Oxy as that's a waste imo. If you want to add to the Oxycodone you already took take 25 to 50 milligrams of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).,What would be the best way to take the morphine?

166,"I looked on psychonaut and it didn’t say anything about the two being dangerous I’ve took 500mg of tramadol anyway, feeling nice lol","Everyone’s different.  The danger with tramadol is more related to seizures, whereas codeine would just be respiratory depression really (or allergic reaction in a VERY rare instance).  If I were you, I’d just pick up an antihistamine like Doxylamine and take a dose of that with my codeine.  Definitely helps stop itching."

170,"I mean, it’s probably not the safest idea, but I’ve heard loads of success stories, so it’s definitely possible.,, girls and guys included... just dress down don’t act flashy and never let your money walk","I've cold copped successfully hundreds of times (100% success rate) in a Major City that rhymes with smalltimore. I'm a 28 year old white dude who weighs 140 lbs. And I was the only white guy in the entire area. Just stay alert and read the situation, it's not that hard here where I live. If you're worried about getting robbed or sold fake stuff maybe just buy a little bit so that you can go to try it and if it's good go buy more"
171,Is cold copping a horrible idea?,Depends on what city cant say it here but that really Is a factor I'm on east coast mssg me if u r
172,Is cold copping a horrible idea?,"Your not doing this because you think because u drank that means you're back to day zero, right? 

If so that doesn't mean shit. You're doing great don't stop."
173,Is cold copping a horrible idea?,Look if you ain't shady looking it don't matter much. They want your business. Honestly IMO I find it easier for a female to do this than a male. Dealers trust females more and don't think they would set them up
174,Is cold copping a horrible idea?,"Not to be sexist but for a girl I’d recommend against going out alone at night.  It’s the street and people are fucking mentally sick, desperate, and don’t give a fuck about anyone life including their own.  

Can you get a buddy to go with you?  I only say this because every girl that’s ever told me about trying to cold cop in cities said they just got taken advantage of, groped, or worse.  

At least go during the day, and to an area with considerable numbers of people around

If you must go alone at night, AT LEAST bring some form of protection.  Taser, gun if you’re bout that, etc... 

Funny story (and genius idea for peace lovers/tree huggers)... someone I know actually brought a small concealable bullhorn/megaphone with her to cold cop - though I’m sure a dollar store air horn can would work just fine - and when a group of old men ended up approaching and threatening her, she “blooooop’d” it real quick and said “y’all  wouldn’t believe how loud this shit gets”

The pussies scattered faster than light flashed rats lol"

177,What exactly is “nodding out” and why does it feel so good?,"Neat question, but I feel like the answer might be so in-depth that it wouldn't mean that much to a layperson. Hopefully not though and someone answers. Even complicated things can sometimes be simplified to an extent that it can be understood to a lesser degree, but some things just require you to do the time to learn all the knowledge underpinning the understanding.

I know (and I mean know in the loosest possible sense) that benzos work by doing something to a certain chemical ""gate"" that moves things (ions?) from one place to another in the brain, which I think inhibits the effect of something called GABA at certain receptors. I've read that this is why mixing barbiturates and benzos is so lethal, because while one type of medication reduces or increases the number of these chemicals or ions, the other reduces or increases the frequency, meaning 2+2=8. I wonder if opiates work a similar way?

I had a look on wikipedia, on the [endorphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins) page:

>In the [PNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system), endorphins, primarily β-endorphin, are released from the pituitary gland and bind to μ-receptors. The binding of these two components inhibits the pain signal of the periphery nerves by blocking the neurotransmitter [substance P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_P). The mechanism in the CNS is similar but works by blocking a different neurotransmitter. When the endorphin binds to the μ-receptor, it inhibits the release of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which, in turn, increases the production and release of dopamine, the neurotransmitter associated with pleasure.\[15\]\[16\]

So it seems that opiates inhibit the release of GABA, but whether this is true of all opiates or just endorphins I don't know. But as far as I can tell there are a bunch of different opiate receptors with varying effects, and each opiate will have a distinct binding profile.

Whether this is significant or not, it seems that opiate receptors are considered ""G protein-coupled receptor"" ( ...constitute a large [protein family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_family) of [receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor) that detect [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) outside the [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) and activate internal [signal transduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction) pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses.). From wiki page on GABA:

>Two general classes of GABA receptor are known:\[3\]  
>  
>GABAA in which the receptor is part of a ligand-gated ion channel complex  
>  
>GABAB metabotropic receptors, which are **G protein-coupled receptors** that open or close ion channels via intermediaries (G proteins)  
>  
>Neurons that produce GABA as their output are called GABAergic neurons, and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the adult vertebrate.

So as far as I can tell opiates inhibit GABA and in turn causes dopamine to be produced. So they cause drowsiness in a similar way many ""drowsy"" medications do, such as benzos, but how similarly I don't know. I simply don't have the knowledge to know whether most of what I've written is right, because I don't have the more fundamental understanding of how the brain works, so don't take any of this as gospel. A little bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Whether we could understand to any meaningful extent an explanation beyond ""it does things to the chemicals in your brain"", who knows. Hopefully someone with the expertise can reply and try their best to dumb it down for us. May be worth posting this on ELI5 or another ask questions sub if you're really interested.

edit: Also worth keeping in mind that we don't fully understand how many medications work, opiates probably included. From [here](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/opioids-mechanisms-of-action):

>Inhibition of neurotransmitter release is considered to be the major mechanism of action responsible for the clinical effects of opioids. Nevertheless, despite extensive investigation, understanding of the cellular actions of morphine and other opioids is incomplete."

You won't make it home at all if you wreck and die, or even worse, kill someone else (worse bc you already knew the risks you were taking while driving high, those other people didn't sign up for that even if everyone knows that there is technically a chance of dying from getting hit by a driver under the influence every time they get in their car, you still don't expect it and shouldn't have to).

I always leave my rigs at home to make it easier to wait so that I couldn't do my shit even if I wanted to. Plus when you wait until you get home that makes the shot that much better bc you can just sit and enjoy it without having to worry about someone seeing you do it in your car or call the cops bc you're taking too long in the circle k bathroom so they assume you're shooting up, or have to worry about getting pulled over bc you're driving extra shitty since you're high.

Don’t fuk with Subs for more than a day or two, please. They’re just methadone in disguise. Always stick with the quicker kick. Subs withdrawal takes weeks, months of slow-burning hell. I would trade for a few days of kicking the sheets anyway.

224,Anyone had a piss test sent to the lab while using fake pee (quickfix in my case)? What was your experience?,"You’re fine. Most employers have a contract with a certain lab, so they collect it wherever is convenient for you then ship it to thier lab. 

Just went through this a few weeks ago and i read a few stories online about people getting busted for substituting. The few of these stories that come up are suspicious. They usually are from new account users and don’t have many details. This leads me to believe that the reviews are fake perhaps from a shill for a different synthetic urine company. 

I also think that if you give the person administering the test any reason to suspect you may have just substituted they may have some BS protocol they go through to make you perform an observed test. Things such as taking way too long in the bathroom, or making noise with the bottle, leaving the bottle or cap in the bathroom. 

If its on temp and looks like pee the person administering the test cant really do anything even if they do suspect something.  If you made it past the initial validity testing done there at the collection site and they poured it into tubes and shipped it you are fine."

Thanks for the advice...I agree","Lmao slurring them out at half speed haha... Even a small medical dose makes me slow, i feel bad for the people who are around me because i know i just look a mess 😂"
255,Really Need Educated/Experienced advice - In current withdrawal - should I dose for dream Job interview in 2 days?,I feel like you’re gonna dose anyway.. BUT if you really wanna  push thru this go get some opms gold Extract capsules when you wake up and pop 3 of those baby’s  and enjoy a nice cup of Joe and wait like an hour maybe two and you’ll be good! For real.. they do help and give you that pick me up energy/mood lift when withdrawing.. then the morning of your interview do the same thing take them on an empty stomach with a cup of coffee and go get that job!! You may want to eat a little something light after about an hour of taking it/before your interview just in case you get nauseous or anything like that but you’ll know from taking it the day before how it’ll effect you.

I don't have anything to dose with so it would have to be a conscious decision tomorrow whether to pick up before, or not, since I also need tomorrow to honestly prep my ass off for this final interview.  

Because it's definitely the energy/mood lift that's hindering me being as prepared as possible for this opportunity.  

I'm going to try your method when I wake up tomorrow... That will give me enough time to see how much uplift in mood/energy it really gives me.  I've been pushing through with caffeine and clonidine to prep.

I know I have to be successful at this job, if I am so lucky to get it, sober...so in a weird way, I want to get through the interview without a minor relapse/setback... but I also do know that I can LOW dose once, and leave it at that.  I've solo tapered before and know how much self-control it takes to taper when having the Oxy on hand...  if I low dose this time, I don't have more and can handle the detox.  I've been successful at that part before.  But, trust me, I am not trying to go clean for this job... I am trying to go clean and this opportunity happened to land in my lap...so regardless...I am going clean...with or without this job (just want my best chance at getting it)"

So go try the Kratom and minimize as much of that as you can to clear your mind and not be sweating/freezing your ass off 24/7 and then you can go in and get this job you deserve! Also please take ibuprofen... (I know) but really it makes such a difference on the aches that creep up on you

Thank goodness... It's based on education, experience, and skill.  They will check references but not a problem.  I'm actually a model employee as far as work and productions is concerned.  Have been in leadership departments of past employment locations for past 15 years.  Developed this problem really in 2015 but started when I broke my leg in 2002.  Funny...I enjoyed opioids then, and was in surgeries for 3 years straight... prescribed Opioids the ENTIRE 3 years.  Soon as I healed, didn't even ween off... just stopped.  And I know it's crazy, and maybe ignorance is bliss, but I swear I did not experience any withdrawals then.  

I didn't touch a single opiate until maybe 2005-8 at a party or two.... then nothing for 7 years.  A co worker had a steady supply and that's when I really began to enjoy the oxy ride.  It's so strange to me I could do 3 straight years of Oxy and stop without thinking about it before, but now that I know withdrawals are associated with stopping, I swear it makes it 1000 times worse.  Plus, I was in my early 20's back then so maybe my body processed the chemicals easier...kinda like when you're young and never used to get hangovers....now they last 3 days lol."

Just so happens, biggest opportunity in years has LITERALLY FALLEN into my lap.  Trust me...if I had an extra week, I wouldn't even think about low dosing (or dosing at all).... I know I was over the worst at the end of day 3/early day 4 so was fine until they moved up the interview.

And @\_morpheus\_23 - You're exactly right....I could get through the interview, but i would be at 20% tops as far as being on top of my interview game... and I think I'm being generous...probably closer to the high single digit percentages.

There's a lot to prep for tomorrow's interview so I did pick up this am.  I got 3 OC 80's (the crushable ones...not the gel ones) and dosed 120mg's today to help with my prep.  It was a god send as far as the energy it gave me and the ability to concentrate on my prep...not to mention the confidence I did not have leading up to this interview.  

My plan is to dose the rest 120mgs tomorrow 1 hr before my interview on an empty stomach, chased by a cup of thick coffee, black.  

I appreciate your advice and for not beating around the bush.  Lot's have said I've been through the worst of it (physical Withdrawal-wise) since interview is happening day 5, but this opportunity is life changing...not just for me, but for everyone who's cared for me through what I've put myself and them through.

I'll update this thread tomorrow and let you know how it went.  Rumor is they will request your references within 30 mins of the interview ending if they decide to hire the candidate.

I'm going to dose 2 hrs prior and follow your suggestion.  That's when I felt the best and was able to fully focus after dosing today.  I know tomorrow my tolerance will be significantly higher (so weird how that happens in one use) so timing should work out perfectly.

294,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,I can't even find real Quinine water anymore.  Do you order it online?  The stuff they sell at the grocery stores contains barely any Quinine to be useful.
295,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,"Modern tonic water contains considerably less quinine than it did in the past (when it was actually a malarial tonic). I’d imagine if it was as loaded with quinine as it used to be it would be unbearably bitter (unless you add plenty of Gin and limes!) so I’d assume that’s why. 

I think there’s something like 8mg of quinine per litre now, but that’s just off the top of my head and I’m almost certainly wrong so check it for yourself to find out exact numbers."

Congrats on your taper so far!! Btw how as your taper? I tried going from 30 mg to 10 mg, and that was fine. Probably because I only dosed my 30 mg every 12 or 16 hours, well spread out, with sometimes only dosing 10 mg between each day until my next 30 mg dosage. I did that for a while, and it worked great. But then I had only 1 week of dosing 3-4x a day on 30mg, and my tolerance increased. 

So I decided I should try to taper just for a week or so to lower my tolerance. Going to 10 was fine, I did that for 5 days no problem at all. But when I tried going down to 0 mg, I still had bad stomach pains, restless legs, antsy behavior, anxiety. Not too bad though, but enough where I realized I was withdrawing.

So that's what led me to Kratom, and it's great so far. I would try doing 2-3 grams of Kratom"
303,"Got the same issue; wondering the same thing. Taking around 50mg hydros daily, down from 120mg a few years ago. Hell, down from 90mg a couple of months ago. But, wanting to engage some kratom to get that number even lower. Any recs on dosage and method (tea, pills, etc.)?",I’m high and feeling great on Kratom. I know it’s not H or even Percocet but it’s very good. Congrats on lowering your dose. I would probably start with 2-3 mg max of Green Vein. I like Maeng Da. It’ll really help. You’ll probably enjoy it.

305,"By mg, you mean g, right?",Yeah I meant to say maybe 1 gram. Like I was saying I’ve been taking it for years and I don’t take 2-3 mgs at once.
306,How much Kratom to avoid opiate withdrawals?,"I personally take 4 teaspoons in the morning (8 gs), and follow it up with 2 teaspoons (4 gs) every three hours for the rest of my day. I would start between 8-10 gs to avoid getting sick, then dose yourself based on how you feel. You aren't likely to get the wobbles, since you've got a high tolerance to opiates. But I would definitely start with that just to avoid getting sick. I need to also let you know when I say teaspoons, I literally referring to a level measuring teaspoon. Try not to use a kitchen spoon or anything as a guide because you won't get your dose right with that. The taste is bad, it's awful, but it sure beats the hell out of feeling sick and in withdrawals. I use toss and wash, took me a while to get used to it. Chocolate milk is gonna be your best friend for consuming it."

Toss and wash was extremely hard to master but well worth the two second inconvenience. I use the red strains because they're the most comparable to pain medicine.

312,Used China white heroin (never used an opioid before) for the first time a couple weeks ago. It was super underwhelming. What went wrong?,"Heroin is a little strong for a first opiate. When I see non opiate users try it, all of the other side effects often overpower the good feeling. If you're looking for typical opiate euphoria I would try something weaker like hydrocodone or oxycodone (if you can be sure that you're taking real pills).  


But all that aside, I would suggest not getting to the point where you have a taste for opiates. If you tried them once and didn't see what the hype was about, GREAT. Go back to your life. You won't have much of one if you keep doing H."

319,Used China white heroin (never used an opioid before) for the first time a couple weeks ago. It was super underwhelming. What went wrong?,"First of all, China white going ""wrong"" would leave you dead, be thankful you had a lackluster first experience.

Secondly, opioids don't give you that ""great euphoric feeling"" unless you're in extreme physical or mental pain, and even then, the relief from said pain carries most of the ""euphoria"". (sorry if you are and this doesn't apply to you, just from my and others' experiences)

Now is the best time to stop and be glad it didn't work well for you. If you think you're in a rut now, just wait until you're in a worse rut and also withdrawing. I don't mean to sound blunt, but you're realllllllyyyy going to wish you went back in time and stopped yourself right here."

If they didn’t feel pleasurable then why would people do them? And I have sever depression so I figured I would have felt something strong.
321,Really? Everyone here talks about how euphoric opiates feel. If they didn’t feel pleasurable then why would people do them? And I have sever depression so I figured I would have felt something strong.,"I was surprised too. I'd describe them more as being extremely numbing as opposed to euphoric. You can imagine why a numbing drug would be popular among people who have been dealt a bad hand in life. Also fentanyl is also known for being more sedating as opposed to feel-good. Stimulants, now that's real euphoria.

Speaking logically, the best advice you will ever get is to never take recreational opioids again. If you're absolutely determined to try a new drug, which I would advise against, ketamine is probably the best option in your case and has less life-ruining potential.

I hope things get better soon♡"

323,Also China white heroin is almost always fentanyl or a fentalogue now. Guess you have a natural tolerance?,I don’t know. I didn’t snort too much. Less than a match head size.

Idk I want to keep trying but I know it’s a bad idea. My interest in heroin fluctuates with my mood. For whatever reason my depression has been really bad lately.

Then I gave him $40 for an evening run and told him I’d have $150 to buy more off him when he was back.  He took my $40, gave me 8 8mg Suboxone as collateral, and took off.  By the time I called him a few hours later to check-in, he had already blocked me.

The next day, though, as soon as I started feeling shitty, I took a Suboxone and had no PWD, they worked as they were supposed to and I felt right again.  I ended up taking 5 that day to see if I could get high off them (spoiler alert, I cannot), but since then I’ve been taking small bits of the last 3 twice a day and am doing pretty fucking well.

I’ve been going on runs for 2-5 days mostly, but prior to that, I broke my 15+ year Heroin habit with 50-60 days clean.

I’ve been taking the Subs for about 3-4 days now to avoid withdrawals from my last run, but I could probably jump off them now with very limited impact.

I appreciate the offers of help and such, but I’ve been at this so long and my “addiction” these days is limited to few day runs, that the after effects aren’t that bad.

I could see if you just didn't do as much activities as you used to, but doing nothing but staying home 100% of a year only shooting dope and sleeping is a long fuckin time to do nothing.

You can't take the dog for a walk/ go for a walk in the park, or go out to eat, go see a movie?  Most of us Just don't have the extra cash to pay for movies or dinner out, but going for a walk or bike ride is free."

363,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,I imagine if I didn't have to come up with the cash to support my habit thats about all my life would consist of at this point. If you've really gotta get motivated for something just throw some meth into the mix
364,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,"Addiction is only a small part of your equation. You clearly suffer from some kind of mental illness related to depression. The long term methods to turning your life around are the obvious ones, including exercise, proper sleep schedule, and social interaction. Obviously therapy, various blood tests, and likely medication are needed for you to recover. Now this is a huge double edged sword, but adderall might be beneficial for you in the SHORT term, IF you add it to the rest of what I mentioned. If you simply take adderall and do nothing else to improve your situation, within 6-9 months you'll just need adderall to feel the way you do now, and without it you'll feel even worse."

369,Can you overdose on suboxone?,"If you have no opiate tolerance, yes.  Also a chance of overdosing if you mix with benzos."

371,"Hi again guys, subutex, suboxone or methadone?","It all depends on what else you have going on along with addiction. Like myself I have chronic pain so my choice is gonna be straight towards methadone. I've had both, methadone is an effective pain med and for myself it didnt give the the craving effect like other opiates have. The only thing I'd say to warn people of is be prepared to either get on it then get off as quickly as possible if you dont want to be dependent on a drug, if your gonna do the long haul make sure you are gonna be able to get this script for as long as you want/need it. Most say that you'll never lose a prescription as long as you abide by the guidelines, dont abuse it sell it whatever it would be to cause you to loose it. I know otherwise. Drug policies changing every day getting stricter made it impossible to continue methadone after 13 years of an unblemished script history when my doctor retired. I simply could not afford what the few doctors that prescribed methadone were wanting. Second thing is be prepared to loose your teeth. Theses meds dry your mouth out so bad it is unavoidable, so be prepared to be very proactive on dental care."
372,How to reduce/eliminate opiate nausea?,"Ginger is a fucking miracle bro. I've tried every OTC and many Rx only nausea meds and some of these worked *alright* at best. A few yrs ago I read that ginger root can help with nausea of all kinds, so I went and bought a bottle of ginger root capsules at Walmart for like $4 not expecting it to do shit because come on... Its ginger. But damn I was surprised. For me it Works better than any actual drug did for nausea. It's all I've been using for the past 4-5 years or so now and it still works just as well as it did day 1."

378,Why does heroin make life less boring?,"Because of dopamine. Dopamine is what you get when you like anything at all, a show, a book, or a good game.

382,Why does heroin make life less boring?,"This is a somewhat philosophical question that deserves some philosophical pondering. I believe it falls directly in line with Lao Tzu and his “Tao Te Ching” explaining Taoism (Daoism)

“We mould clay into a pot,
but it is the emptiness inside
that makes the vessel useful.”

— Lao Tsu, Tao Te Ching quotes 11

Essentially - it’s not what a life “contains” that matters...it’s the creation and process of setting up the kind of life that is what is meaningful to the individual. Further, it’s how you create your experience and why you do it that makes it worth it (or not worth it).

So in your experience, you are creating a life that allows you to feel good about doing nothing. But if you did nothing without scoring, it would not be the life you want, and thus the boredom is palpable. When you score you know that you are giving yourself the confines of what you want, so whatever happens inside those confines, boredom, is much more acceptable to you and your mind.

A look into this can be seen as following:

However important it is, non-being cannot exist without the being.  A pot cannot be a pot without the clay.  A house cannot be a house without the pillars and walls. Money cannot play the role or exchange if cannot be recognised as a tool of trust.


Just a thought.


Not to mention...H dulls senses, emotions, fears, anxieties, etc. thus doing nothing feels like doing something, when high.

    Crystal methamphetamine,  it most definitely can give you energy, and lasts for a pretty substantial amount of time!

     Dextro-amphet, mixed amphet (Adderall), lisdexamfetamine, etc aka ""pharmaceutical speed"" cost more and imo is less price effective, and less euphoric than methamphetamine, but they most definitely give you energy, suppress your appetite, and will keep you awake if you take the right amount.

I have never had this form available to me bcuz of location, crystal meth is so cheap here the demand for other Stims is fairly low, I rate this #2, from what I've heard, read and gathered.

456," Depends on where you are located. I'm assuming Brittian (because of the £ British pound symbol used), I'm from the US, but I'll take a shot at it, I assume your referring to amphetamine in one form or another, depending on what is common in your area.  
    Crystal methamphetamine,  it most definitely can give you energy, and lasts for a pretty substantial amount of time!  But I wouldn't compare it to any opioid, oxycodone or otw, it is definitely a different feeling, some get a great deal of euphoria from it, and others (me included in the latter category) not as much, also I strictly I.V. crystal, I hate how insufflation feel in comparison but that's a subjective thing, and oral feels closer to i\n roa imo as well, I enjoy the rush of shooting.. but I also enjoy instant gratification ⚡..lol, but that being said if I take to big a dose, re-dose too soon, I kinda get a opposite effect, not talkative, not energetic, or much euphoria, I get kinda ""stuck"" (I know alot of people who can sit and smash a ton more than me though, so keep in mind this is an opinionated review) but if you are into stims more than opi's, which I prefer to use opioids, or speed & heroin, or speed and Benzodiazepines, this is bcuz I also get a shaky feeling\racing heart-beat that's unpleasant at times, but when I mix w\benzos, or opioids I get the best of both worlds 🌓👍.

458,Speed anyone?,"I was a oxy addict 300mg daily, u.k aswel"
459,"I was a oxy addict 300mg daily, u.k aswel","Bro, the pain after the heaven right? Did you lose ya link?"
460,"I was a oxy addict 300mg daily, u.k aswel",Feel ya bro
461,Speed anyone?,"Since you're in uk by speed your probably mean amphetamine yeah?

I used a lot of speed when I was younger. Honestly I never found it that recreational, I only used it for energy, concentration, motivation. Plus it was cheap enough to use everyday when I was still in school. It's euphoric, but different to oxy. It's worth a try I guess, but just note that if you rely on speed for energy/concentration regularly, it'll fuck up your sober energy and concentration levels."
462,10mg of endone At work ?,"Mate.... do it sober. You’ll be fine. 

Anxiety before starting a new job is totally normal and you don’t need to medicate to relieve that. Once your in an settled the anxiety will ease and you’ll be fine. 

Save the endone for Friday after work as a reward for doing the right thing. 


Sorry for the life lesson I’m just an old ex junkie idiot and know that what your thinking is not a good idea."
463,10mg of endone At work ?,"Go sober. Once you start that 'I have to' shit your fucked. Be scared, do it scared. Nerves are there to power you. 

Then Friday bang em up your ass and play candy crush and eat sour haribo till you nod out. Lol.

464,Is it safe to orally take fent pressed pills?,"Stick to Oxy, why in the world would you want to move on to Fentanyl?"
465,Is it safe to orally take fent pressed pills?,"Hey guys, just wanted to update you all. The pills came today and I flushed them all down the toilet. I took all of your responses to heart."
466,Is it safe to orally take fent pressed pills?,"Dude if you take a fent pressed 30 after taking pharm oxy it will more than likely...not end well.

If you have to take it; crush it up, get a match head amount, split that in half, then take that. Wait 20 minutes and see how you feel."
467,Is it safe to orally take fent pressed pills?,Smoke it. Seem to be the only somewhat safe way to take it
468,Smoke it. Seem to be the only somewhat safe way to take it,Still had friends OD from smoking fent.
469,Is it safe to orally take fent pressed pills?,"I use the presses by the quarter pieces. I can do up to 150-200mg of oxy a day easily. But depending on the batch of presses, then I’ll go through anywhere from a single press to 3 or 4 a day :/"
470,Is it safe to orally take fent pressed pills?,No dude you could die. Pls smoke or snort an extremely small amount.
471,No dude you could die. Pls smoke or snort an extremely small amount.,Fentanyl has a super high bioavailability intranasally. I wouldn't recommend OP snort it.
472,Is it safe to orally take fent pressed pills?,Fuck. That's a conundrum. I wouldn't have the balls. If you have to just take small amounts. I'd say orally but the other guy seems to think smoking it would be best. I'm a binman not a doctor.
473,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,I wouldn't worry too much. Here in the US I can tell you that all of the treatment places ive been usually use one main medication to taper you off opiates whether it be oxys or dope you were using. This is usually some sort of suboxen or methadone. They usually add additional meds to help with anxiety and stuff. I have gone through the same exact treatment when I initially had a pill problem and when I became full blown IV dope user. What changed was the starting dosage of whichever tapering drug (methadone or subs) the facility would be using. Typically when you start the treatment process you will be dosed accordingly until your discomfort fades away. All you need to do is be vocal about how your withdraw symptoms are.. It really dosent matter pills or heroin. Best of luck.
474,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,"Oxycodone does not show up under opiates, and heroin would test positive for opiates, they won't do just a standard 5 panel.. urine analysis kits have been around for so long, it's easy for any institution to choose a urine test that tells them what they need to know, or possibly test your blood, but they don't cater it to you that specifically, as stated above, u will get either Methadone, max they can give you is 30mg to start out, probably be more realistically 20/25mg, or Suboxone (Buprenorphine, and Nalaxone) 8mg\2mg, 
      If you are worried about them telling anyone else about your drug use, don't HIPPA protects your right to Privacy, unless you are considered a threat to yourself, or another person, in that case they are obligated t to say something. 
   The main reason they will drug test you is to make sure you in fact test positive for one opioid substance or another, since Methadone, and Buprenorphine are both powerful medications, they don't want to take the liability of giving a non opioid tolerant person a dose of either as it could be potentially very dangerous and even life threatening! 
   I've been in both programs several x and am very familiar with the process that take place in either the methadone clinic, and at a Suboxone Dr... Sounds like in your case you are more than likely going to b given Suboxone... Ns if you have any experience with it, but it's a lil strip, or a tablet you place under your tongue and let fully dissolve, I personally hate Suboxone, but there are others who swear by it, that said, they both do work to alleviate all w\d symptoms by 2nd day several hrs after 2nd dose.
    They will also in either case make sure you are in active withdraw b4 they give you either med as well, it's easy enough to fake this part if you had to, just look up all the symptoms of opioid use disorder ""post acute withdraw symptoms"" or PAWS, and memorize... A Dr will ask u a series of questions, the goal is to basically say you are currently experiencing as many symptoms on that list as possible 👍 how that helps you understand what is likely going to happen going forward in either case, good luck!"
475,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,Tell them about the dope because if you don’t get any comfort meds it’s gonna be extremely hard to stop.
476,Tell them about the dope because if you don’t get any comfort meds it’s gonna be extremely hard to stop.,"What ""comfort meds"" are you thinking they will give besides methadone or buprenorphine, definitely no Benzo as these programs are getting extremely strict as far as putting anyone on Either Bupe and benzos, or m\done and benzos, they might give you an otc non-stimulant stool softener, Buspirone for anxiety, Seroquel for help sleeping and really I don't see much of any other comfort meds being used that isn't otc garbage, or shit meds rx'd to you basically no one in the program will want to take.  Unless you can think of any other meds, that would be beneficial for someone suffering from opioid wd?  In jail when you get booked in you can tell them you have u 7gram\daily habit, and they will give you hydroxyzine, and stool softener, and Tylenol, my point being by law that is all they are required to do in order to help you treat the symptoms.  Fuckin shitty I know, but they definitely will not give you any scheduled substance in conjunction w\ either medication assisted treatment center I've been to, and I've been to several in each category, they just cycle the addicts through like cows at a slaughter-house 👨=🐮=🍔"

478,Oxycodone with 325 mg of Tylenol?,Lol what’s your question? If you got sick the dose was to high for you. Not of APAP but of oxy.
479,Oxycodone with 325 mg of Tylenol?,I'm asking why I didn't feel anything
480,I'm asking why I didn't feel anything,"Because you don’t know what you’re looking for.  Opiates aren’t a “party drug,” they provide a very subtle warmth and euphoria, moreso with higher doses, until you “nod off”.  It’s only gonna give you relief if you seek it.  It’s very specific."
481,Oxycodone with 325 mg of Tylenol?,"You might have thrown up the oxy that was left. When you do that, it's basically a buzz kill and your body isn't absorbing anymore of the drug. In a nutshell."
482,Any interactions with oxycodone and cigarette(nicotine)?,No
483,Any interactions with oxycodone and cigarette(nicotine)?,Just buzz
484,Any interactions with oxycodone and cigarette(nicotine)?,Lol no wtf
485,Lol no wtf,"Why the ""wtf""?   
I has been shown that cigarette smoking can decrease certain substances in regards of potency(see benzodiazepines).  
As I am no chemist or neurobiologist, I figured it doesn't hurt to ask around a bit."
486,Any interactions with oxycodone and cigarette(nicotine)?,I don't believe so but I do smoke more after taking pills than I do when I'm out of them.
487,Benzo with opiates ?,No !! I would 100% take the benzo after shooting up.  Used to take Xanax and the. Shoot up and I’ve OD’d. The Xanax causes to much respiratory depression to handle shooting H and it will put you out. Do the H first then slowly take Xanax till your at your peace. I did Xanax and blacked out and shot up and pretty much died I didn’t wake up for the whole day I was breathing like 6 breaths a min still fucked up on the Xanax even after Narcan

489,who says hes banging it? and theres really no safe way to do this. just dont take big doses of either,Either or banging or sniffing it smoking it either way I still think it’s very dangerous to do benzos first. They are the secret killer in my opinion that’s all
490,Either or banging or sniffing it smoking it either way I still think it’s very dangerous to do benzos first. They are the secret killer in my opinion that’s all,the only way it would be safer is if he waited for the dope high to diminish and then take the benzo...otherwise our methods are equally dangerous. he just needs to make sure he doesnt over do it
491,the only way it would be safer is if he waited for the dope high to diminish and then take the benzo...otherwise our methods are equally dangerous. he just needs to make sure he doesnt over do it,Yes I agree.

Not judging. More jelly if anything. But you crazy."
494,Benzo with opiates ?,"i would take the benzo first, wait till it peaks, then take some hits"
495,When you smoke on opiates do you try to get high as fuck or do you just want a light weed buzz?,I HATE nodding. I like getting that good buzz where I’m still able to go out and do shit. I just have a better time and am more delightful to be around when I’m out and about
496,I HATE nodding. I like getting that good buzz where I’m still able to go out and do shit.

I’m with you, would rather have a good head buzz full of energy."
497,When you smoke on opiates do you try to get high as fuck or do you just want a light weed buzz?,"I say light...maybe 5-6 hits of gas and I’m good. Too much weed gets me a tad tired, changes the buzz no doubt either way."
498,"I say light...maybe 5-6 hits of gas and I’m good.

Nice quality weed tho

That will neutralize the dark marks. You can apply it with your fingers and kind of buff, or blend, it in. Then go over that with concealer that matches your skin tone. Again you can use your fingers for that. If you really want it to last you can buy powder to set it with."

540,Is it safe to chug a beer or two on suboxone?,I think its fine. But idk honestly
541,Is it safe to chug a beer or two on suboxone?,"A couple things to consider—

Buprenorphine is metabolized by the liver, so your liver health and overall drinking history and habits are worth considering.

The main concern with buprenorphine and alcohol is respiratory depression, where tolerance and dosing and bupe’s long half-life come into play, along with other factors (especially any other meds or supplements that could contribute.)

The biggest issue I see is....Natty Ice? You may want to see a professional on that one ;)

Edit — in another thread you said you’re almost nodding? If your tolerance is that low to bupe at the moment, I would not push it with alcohol. Being on subs long-term versus recreationally makes a big difference with respiratory depression."

I dident walk for a year. And i get kidney stones too.

But ive been mosly off for a yearb 95% cause its dry im draling with mental cravings snd troubled sleep stilln not nearly as bad as last oct nov tho. Those were tough months. 5 years of eating drinking opium en mass everyday for 5 years . it gets better. Its not easy but once your making progress or keep track of $ saved it gives you a shove to keep going. If shit was available and i dident move 1000 miles away i dont know if mentally i would have lasted. Dont let this sound negative though. I thought id never get off tea.litterally dident think it possible. Know i eat a ounce of kratom a day for pain and am on benzos. Both help immensely but ive stopped both for weeks though never in tandem. And benzos only when i had pills. Dont just go pick up. A mean benzo habbit. Tougher than smack. You got it, you just really need to want it. Its never just gonna be easier and its tough as fuck. So your mentality will be crucial. Find the things you want, know the reasons your stopping and plow through it brother. Eventually its less and less a problem. No real lingering damage. Vikes dont work any more in my case. Shit kratom works on my pain. Better than vikes but i dont feel high. Maybe thats good though.

Good luck"

563,8/2mg Brand Name Suboxone vs. 8mg Generic Subutex: They Aren't the Same Dosage?,"Generally same mg if subutex is peachy/pink football. 8mg. Both equally ass effective ingested, snorted, or sublinqual."
564,"Generally same mg if subutex is peachy/pink football. 8mg. Both equally ass effective ingested, snorted, or sublinqual.","I'm not disagreeing they're essentially equally effective, as it's well known that \~8mg of bupe, particularly when taken daily, activates nearly all available MORs. I'm simply wondering if I'm reading this wrong. It appears that it really does include 8% more bupe than the brand name strips. The subutex tablets I have access to are white and perfectly round."
565,8/2mg Brand Name Suboxone vs. 8mg Generic Subutex: They Aren't the Same Dosage?,"ilucki think generics need to be within 20% of name brand to get an fda approval so they may just throw the extra 8% in to make sure they are on par. Not everyone will have that spot on .64mg but the amt of bupe to filler ratio before mixed will weigh out to that. 

Good luck. I got some tablets just 6 when i was getting off and i ddent like them but it prob had to do with not waiting long enough and putfing myself in precipitated wd. If your just switching id guess its all the same, no different than EVERYONE has a brand of 30s they love and a brand they hate.

They can be +/- 10% of the peak plasma level achieved by the name brand. So in theory, two generics could differ by as much as 20% in terms of peak plasma level, but can only differ by a maximum of \~4-5% in terms of active ingredient. The reason why one contains 8.64mg bupe hcl is because it's equal to 8mg bupe base. However, name brand suboxone strips appear to contain 8mg bupe hcl, not 8mg bupe base."

 I take a rather low dose so small changes are really noticeable, and it makes me think that any consequential difference is due to individual absorption issues or issues in using each type correctly (as best practices do vary some.)"

575,Panic attacks?,"Hey dude, this could possibly a reaction to anything that your dope is cut with. Maybe some Strange new/old fent analogue or smth else. it could be literally everything.

 If you dont send your dope to any testing company then you never will know. It is also highly possible that with a new batch the panic attacks will be gone. Or in the worst case scenario cause no one says a thing your dboy uses more of the cut that is causing this and it gets worse. 

If I were you, I would talk about it with your dboy. Just be nice and friendly and tell him whats happening with you and your body. Give him a feedback. Otherwise he wont will know about that issue. I know that many customers are afraid to tell their dboy that their dope is shit but if you dont do it he wont will know it and wont do shit about it. 

Maybe he already gets his dope cut Like this. Then he has to make the same conversation with his dealer like you need to do with him. 

So the best advice is to a) send it in and get it checked (IDK about the USA but in my country its a free service or b) talk to your dealer which may be uncomfortablw but at least you will know two things ftom talking with him. 1) If he cares about his quality and 2) if he cares about his customers. I wish you the best of luck and if you want to know my opinion the best choice would be to talk to him."

Should keep you ok for 12ish or more hours but I’d wait like 24 before taking another half. But who’s really say what you’ll experience. They’re a so many variables in these situations. Your tolerance, how long you’ve used, how much suboxone you’ve ever used, how you respond to suboxone. Take me for example, if I was seriously going through it and had been using dope continuously for some time that 3/4 isn’t gonna do much except maybe keep me from shitting my pants, I’d still be a miserable useless sweaty anxious mess.

What’s up w/ this?,"Yes, it's the pressure and fatty layer above where you're inside the vein"
620,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,"If you can get your hands on opana you need to close this app and hit up your dude right now lol
..seriously tho.."
621,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,"cause you snorted them, orally 30mg would have you nodding no tolerance"
622,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,Hahahah fr opana is the shit
623,Hahahah fr opana is the shit,"I wouldn’t call them shit, but  i definitely like oxy WAY more"
624,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,Gotta hit the right dosage for your tolerance and it is bliss plus energy. At least for me. Oxycodone is the shit. If you’re looking for true bliss/euphoria in a pill then you need opana my friend! Oxymorphone is the best drug I have tried. Well opiates at least. My heart and mind still love mdma and lsd. Especially together. Morphine is boring. Dilaudid is alright. That’s hydromorphone. Look for those pandas duder.
625,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,"Dilaudid fucking sucks ass, but opana is amazing so if you can get some you need to jump on that as quickly as humanly possible"
626,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,Apparently everyone is different. Oxymorphone for me is even more energizing than oxycodone and it doesn't put me to sleep like hydromorphone and hydrocodone do. It's euphoric for sure but I can never nod from it and it doesn't feel like noddy heaven right before bed like the hydros do. A puff of weed helps give it a noddy edge but sometimes it takes away from the euphoria.
627,Tomorrow bright and early I’m finally tapering. I will be going down from 48 mg a day to 30mg. Then in two weeks down to 24mg. And stabilize at 24mg for a while. What can I expect? Also doctor put me on suboxone so it’ll be my first time taking suboxone instead of subutex,"How long have you been on 48mg per day?  There should be no difference from subutex and suboxone for you, unless you’re shooting it.  Even then many people say there is no difference whatsoever.  At over 32mg, I’m not sure of the side effects of the naloxone to be honest.  Most docs script under 32.  
 
The buprenorphine itself actually presents a higher binding affinity than naloxone does under normal conditions.  When people get PWD (precip withdrawal, after taking subs too soon following use of full agonists) it’s not the naloxone causing it, it’s the high affinity of the bupe.  It kicks other opioids off receptors, and doesn’t allow you to get “high” (at least not easily)

I imagine you’ll be just fine with the taper.  You can always ask for minor adjustments as needed; maybe even ask your prescribing physician for a direct(ish) number to call if your symptoms are too bad - if you feel lucky.  Maybe even ask to stay on subutex and do the taper if it makes you more comfortable.  You can always warm yourself up to it beforehand by taking bits and pieces less each day until your taper appt. 

Then you’ll even have some emergency milligrams to spare :p"

I have no choice unfortunately in the matter 😭so essentially I have 60 suboxone to get me to the 27th starting tomorrow. Essentially 16 days to go from 5 to 3 and stabilize there.

That is a very high dose and for many people the pain does not start until you get down to doses of 2mg and lower. Suboxone and Subutex will feel the same unless you have some kind of sensitivity or side effect from Naloxone. The naloxone was added as an abuse deterrent but is negligible when taken orally and most users do not even have symptoms when being reckless and shooting it. 

Good luck to you!  Once you get down to lower doses and if you feel any side effects, ask your doctor for some comfort meds during the end of your taper (if the goal is tapering to 0).  

Good luck OP!!!!"

641,"Yup, don't use water ;)","True that. I snorted some this morning, I got this rush but it was the most unpleasant rush, just confusion and a short-lived INTENSE headache. Honestly it was kinda scary, thought my brain was shutting down lol. BA might be less, but fuck it, I'll just take it sublingually"
642,How do I snort without it going down my throat?,"Why would you snort suboxone? The membranes in the nose that absorb it are pretty much the same as the ones under your tongue and considering sub strips are made to be administered sublingual you’re just wasting product, especially if it’s going down your throat (there’s no way to prevent drip considering it’s your body’s purposeful reaction to a foreign intruder) The effects will come on in the same amount of time if you snort it as it would if it was taken sublingual; Anything about better bioavailability is not true. Just take it as directed, there’s no reason not to. They were designed with addicts in mind, none of you guys are pulling wool over your psychiatrists eyes"

663,[deleted],I have a pretty high tolerance to both bc I was doing like 5mg xanax a day for a week then ran out and got back w my dope plug and been doing less than a point a day for the past 3 or 4 and I did like less than a point today too. Everyone just kept saying I was gonna die so I freaked kinda but I also have nothing to live for so I was just gonna listen to music and go to sleep and go peacefully.  I think it’s been a couple hours since the xans. It was light outside when I did. Not tryna offend anyone I just don’t value my life but I’m more scared of dying painfully than anything.

I’m alive rn (10:47pm) and not even too high anymore so I guess I’ll be good. I wanna finish this last bit of dope up but at this point Id be playing Russian roulette lol
674,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,Xans and opiates is fun if you can handle both. But if you don't have a benzo/opiate tolerance. You're an idiot. I almost died mixing bars and OC 80 back in the day. Fell out immediately upon feeling the effects of the OC. I wish I could say it was scary. But I just remember feeling good and what not. Drugs suck but are fun sometimes. I guess. Oh well I'm on ketamine and weed rn. Have a nice night. Be safe.

679,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,All the times I went out like waking up in an ambulance out was when I mixed fent and xans. But I had a really heavy IV tolerance to opis and would pop like 10 plus mg of xans in a short period of time. Just be super careful if you do it is really dangerous I’ve lost a lot of friends. I wouldn’t advise it to anyone. But snorting the xans is a waste too anyways if you do that.

697,Same it's fucked do you IV it by ant chance,"Nah I dont IV it, I'm always scerred I'll fuck it up and damage a vein or something.

I just mix it in a tad of water and put it in a nasal spray bottle, I'll mix like 20 subs in a bottle and keep it handy"
698,Why does suboxone give me an amphetamine like high?,Do you take any other opiates as a rule or only just the sub? Many opiates give you that energetic feeling with focus. If you don't have a tolerance and take a small dose (generally) you get that feeling bigtime and it lasts a long time. I usually do 4mg at a time twice a day and get that feeling within an hour of taking it. It's not as pronounced a feeling compared to when I'm totally sober and do a sub though.

702,Why does suboxone give me an amphetamine like high?,"I used to get that energized euphoric high from any opiates. It eventually went away with amounts and time using increased. I have never even understood why everyone wants to ""nod""? To me that's just a waste of good drugs! Anyway to each is there own! Enjoy it any way you can, and no do not mix subs with any opiate..."
703,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,I dont think so
704,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,"The rule with subs is generally less is more. I'd take 1/4 of it or a half just to save money and get more doses out of it. If I'm taking my first dose of the day, I can't tell a difference between 4mg and 8mg. I haven't been on subs long but long enough to have made that out."
705,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,It won't if you stick at that dose. Anything above 12-16 (at once) mg IMO is a waste. Your milage may vary
706,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,Don't snort it just put it under your tongue. You get the exact same effect that way without the possibility of losing some that you get with snorting it
707,Is it safe to do coke and subs at the same time?,It's as safe as combining 2 highly potent addictive substances can be. Which is not much. But as long as you keep it in reason I would not expect much harm.
708,Is it safe to do coke and subs at the same time?,"Nothing like a speedball. 

You're better off waiting until the coke is gone to take any sub"

717,What's everyone's opinion on Ibogaine for recovery?,"I believe it to be majority ineffective, although some people seem to like it. I think it also has a “mystique” associated with it that it’s some kind of suppressed medicine, as another poster called it, and that western medicine just hasn’t caught up. In reality I think a lot of it is snake like used to bilk desperate people out of 10k in Central and South America for a quick psychedelic fix to their problems. There are going to be people who very vehemently disagree. I’ve known 3 people who have done it in real life and all of them relapsed. But hey, I think we should do some studies and decriminalize it and see if it helps. Maybe there is a process that needs to be followed through in order for it to be effective. I want to believe!"

That guy on the other end of the phone wasnt my dealer he was indeed a cop, he replied “your dealer is face down on his floor dead as a door knob so please stop calling we’re trying to clean up this mess.”  Lol and nothing ever came of it so I think you should be good."

729,Most effective way to dose suboxone?,Intranasally is higher than sublingually
730,Most effective way to dose suboxone?,"I wouldn’t even try to inject films like that unless you have micron syringe filters and experience using such a small amount of water to dissolve one. 

I’d just use it sublingually. You could try and dissolve it and use a nasal spray bottle to use it intranasally, but again you would need to be so careful about the amount of water you used for it to be worth it."

I’d just use it sublingually. You could try and dissolve it and use a nasal spray bottle to use it intranasally, but again you would need to be so careful about the amount of water you used for it to be worth it.",Gotcha. What do you mean careful btw? Like be careful not to use too much water?
732,Gotcha. What do you mean careful btw? Like be careful not to use too much water?,"Exactly, nasal sprayers are effective in how they distribute/deliver the water nasally, but they only deliver tiny amounts of at once, so you’d have to spray it more and more depending on how much water you use to dissolve the strip. And that’s all just to get one strip up your nose. 

A brand new, full bottle of Afrin nasal spray, for example, is 15mL so you’d want to use far less than that for it to make practical sense."
733,Most effective way to dose suboxone?,"wut? Nothing and I mean nothing completely bypasses the liver. Maybe first pass, but that's it. 

Put them under your tongue.  They're made to be used that way. Their bioavailibility is high sublingually then putting it in your nose. 

If you don't have an opioid tolerance then shit the best way would be to shoot them, then you'll get 100% bioavailibility instead of the 95% or whatever it is sublingual."

Insufflation has I believe in the 60 to 75 % range when done correctly and a lot of people do it wrong. 

The strips are purposely made for sublingual, and I haven't check the percentage,  but usually when they're made a specific way, they have an extremely high BA that way.

Let me check and come back with an edit, specifically for subs.

Edit: well fuck me running.  It's got a very very poor absorption rate sublingually. 30 to 55% is what all the clincal data reports.  

I was wrong. Apologies. I'd figure the formula would be much better sublingually."

737,Can you get high off vicodin?,"If you have to ask, then I guess you'll never know. My suggestion is you toss them. If you can't figure out how to get high off opioids then you should probably just flush them."
738,Can you get high off vicodin?,Are you kidding?
739,Are you kidding?,uhhh no
740,Can you get high off vicodin?,"Yes you can get high on Vicodin, that has been my drug of choice for 5 years. Youre going to need about 30-50mgs though, 20 didnt even touch me when i first started using. Also, alcohol takes away from the effect of the Vicodin, so I'd recommend not drinking until about 3 hours after youve hit your peak"
741,Can you get high off vicodin?,What whiskey do you drink? I love opiates and whiskey
742,Can you get high off vicodin?,30mg hydro is around 20mg oxy. 20mg hydro is around  ~13.3mg oxy which wouldn't get me high even without tolerance. So yes you can. But you shouldn't be liek that and start using google.
743,30mg hydro is around 20mg oxy. 20mg hydro is around  ~13.3mg oxy which wouldn't get me high even without tolerance. So yes you can. But you shouldn't be liek that and start using google.,Really??!! Even with a tolerance I definitely at least feel something something off even 10 mg of oxy. With no tolerance I’ve seen some people nod out off of 10 mg of oxy. It’s more of a person to person basis in my opinion
744,Really??!! Even with a tolerance I definitely at least feel something something off even 10 mg of oxy. With no tolerance I’ve seen some people nod out off of 10 mg of oxy.

746,Can you get high off vicodin?,My first year of using off and on...2.5mg did me good.
747,Can you get high off vicodin?,Yes but it sucks if you have an opioid tolerance. You should have taken all 3.
748,M box 30's pressed with heroin?,Doubtful... 99.9999% of the time its fent pressies.
749,M box 30's pressed with heroin?,Chances are very very very low. Heroin is not cheap. Fentanyl is.
750,Chances are very very very low. Heroin is not cheap. Fentanyl is.,That's my thinking I just wanted to get a second opinion. Not worth the risk. Dude also has tar so I'll just get that haha.
751,M box 30's pressed with heroin?,"As said above, most likely a fent analogue, buckets of the stuff available sadly. Fast becoming a cutting agent which I find a disgrace to the opioid world.

If it’s a small manufacturing process maybe, but usually on mass H goes in a different direction 👍"

755,Who wants to be clean?,if I never got sick and had and endless supply of money I'd never want to get clean.
756,if I never got sick and had and endless supply of money I'd never want to get clean.,"If I had a replicator like off star trek, that could magically replicate any opiate or duplicate any substance, yeah I probably would not quit.  I'd just make sure to keep huge stashes squirreled away in various locations.

But for now I want to quit as my tolerance is just so high.  I don't get high any more, infact I feel mostly sick in minor withdrawals most of the time. I'm tired of being always cold, low energy etc.  I had much more energy, drive, and motivation when I was clean.   Even with an infinite stash of opiates I'd probably just waste my life getting high and doing nothing, but at least with a stash like that you wouldn't have to worry about chasing dope."
757,Who wants to be clean?,"I'm OFF all opiates. I'm off all methamphetamine.  I'm off all benzos. I'm literally off everything.  I'm 30. I never expected to live pass 27. I always expect to be a static because that's all that I've ever felt I was worth.

I've realized, I'm worth more. I don't want to go back. I don't want to be involved anymore. I've picked up so many felonies this year. I think I had a total of 14 felony charges, 4 of 5 Misdemeanors, and I was still getting stopped by cops.

I've settled some of the stuff,  but I don't want to give up my life to jail. I don't want to stay in the cycle.  

Sure, if there was no social, emotional or physical impact upon myself,  others and the police. I'd get high every single day for the rest of my life, but there are consequences and I'm done with them.

Finally on the right track career wise, I still use, but idk man. Maybe I’m just projecting my own inner conflict onto you but I feel like thinking that way breeds complacency and settling for less.

Oh, but when I'm hitting him I can't talk bc if I ever try to in order to give him a taste of his own medicine he'll throw an absolute bitch fit temper tantrum and tell me he's gonna take all of my shit regardless of if I miss on him or not.

He's recorded me a couple times too and I absolutely could not fucking stand what I saw in the video either, but I usually don't get high when I do my shit bc I like to be able to stretch it out so that I don't have to be sick as much.

In an alternate universe, I definitely probably didn't not film a close-up of a line being snorted just because I thought it might be fascinating to view down the road... or to serve as ""stock footage"" of using drugs.


I've definitely done a number of ""talk to the camera/camera phone"" bike rides while on dope. I probably have those videos since I don't say anything incriminating in those videos.

I wonder.....

Usually if I was doing that, I was more ""energetic"" as opposed to nodding out. Such videos often happened while riding my bicycle to work but I've done it on days off. In fact, now that I'm thinking about it.. oh shit... I gotta check a video, I wanna see if I can correlate the date to determine if I was on dope or subs at the time."

837,"My cousin used to squeeze out the liquid onto a plate, microwave it, then snort the dry powder",Plenty of people have overdosed from shooting the gel from a patch. I guess its very easy to misdose
838,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,I cut a strip and fold it backwards to itself so both sides are facing out and put it in my mouth between my gums and lip . Kinda like chewing tobacco. That got me lit I nodded out found it on the floor the next day and put it back in my mouth and got loaded again lol but I was also on OC 80’s at the time so I had a lot in the old system...
839,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,Yea depending on the brand (Mylan) and if it’s not a gel patch you can cut up the strips into small pieces and put under your tongue.  It will get you blown but be careful obviously bc it can cause overdose.  I wouldn’t recommend it ever but It feels like heaven.

843,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,My first 100/ug h patch i cut about a fifth of and put it on my cheek. I woke up tasting the dirtyass carpet. Dont know how close i came to oding and dieing but it was more than i could handle at the time. Dident recall a buzz just finally getten to try these to realizing i was in the middle of the floor unconcious for an hour. Home alone gf had finally left to see her mom. Took all of 15 seconds from saying bye to playing with the patch. Prob on the floor 15 minutes after. All in all glad she dident find me the next day dead on the flooor...she would have killed me lol

(No idea why) none of us seriously got hurt, one of them did have welts on his head tho. I was wearing a white hoodie, and the next morning it was completely green and brown.

870,Smoke or chew fent patch??,Fentanyl has in general a short half life. So there wont be any difference between chewing or smoking. But smoking them is a bit safer cause it is possible that the fent isnt everywhere the same mcg amount on the patch. For example if you got a 100mcg patch there could be in one corner 40mcg and in the other just 10mcg. And for chewing you mostly cut the patch in pieces and then you could chew on the 40mcg or the 10 mcg piece so its more likely to OD. So I would rather smoke it than chew on it.

I spend my day in work in my office, by my heater, reading reddit. Kids are fighting outside my office (which is in a main coridoor).  I wish for them to go away.

I come home, to find my parents are pissed off with me as they have found some of my codeine 60's. ""You're taking those tablets again"" they say.  As if I can just stop taking them, throw them out, no worries at all."

881,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,that feeling after shooting too much heroin when i start to wake up and i dont know if im dead or alive. i could be in that state forever. or just dead
882,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,Got me thinking of Penelope Cruz 😂
883,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,"LOL, just getting high off opiates at all. I snorted two crushed oxys at 15mg (a 10 pill and a 5) a couple weeks ago and all I got was a mild buzz and took a nap at the end. Taking it orally just gives me nausea and itchiness.

I did get a little high off 3 tramadol once, but I think I gave away the bag I had. I don't know what happened to those fuckers."

I loved that vinegar smell and taste, the ritual, everything aswell as the high. i was hooked from the start. i would go out and chill in my van at 4:30 am or so when the world was still asleep and the sun was just about to start rising, on this particular day i went out there, (it was parked in my driveway, its like those vans you see ""vanlifers"" living in with carpet and a couch, recliners and a chest table in there, the passenger seat spun around and id go out there early in the morning, a rainy day on this particular day, and i plugged my gamecube into the outlet in there and ran an extension chord from my house to my van. id then sit out there as the rain hit the roof, in my cozy suburban driveway in the PNW, playing my favorite old games, getting super nostalgic about my childhood, and smoking tar. this was back before i got big into fent and tar would actually get me high. id take a little BB sized ball and smoke that over the course of maybe 20 min and actually be nodding out. ahhh, so nostalgic. then id have my boys come over once they woke up around 9 and wed drive to the river, open the doors facing the beautiful view of the columbia river, and hotbox with weed and crack beers while id smoke a few more hits here and there throughout the day.

889,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,Good story bro! I enjoyed that.
890,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,You're an amazing writer. This left me wanting to read more about your experiences.
891,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,"I would say the first time I ever nodded honestly. 2 opana 40s off the DNM. I was so goddman sick tho, it was barely worth it. 

Or the first shot I ever did. I just remember time stopped, and the music I had playing was all that was left. Everything went dark, and I woke up a couple hours later with a dry ass mouth and pounding headache."
892,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,"I chased a meth high once.  Caught it on day 3.  Haven't fucked with it much since then, why bother?"
893,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,"My first percs from when I got my wisdom teeth out when I was 17. I felt like a numb god playing video games. I'd get a good 8-10 matches of team deathmatch on Call of Duty in before I'd come down from one 5mg perc lol.

First few lines of dilaudid were godly too, zonked for a solid 90 min best body high ever

Been blowing my bank pretty much chasing it ever since, sometimes I get close but it's never worth it."
894,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,"It was around the year 2000 , there was a foot of snow outside and I was sitting by the fire. I had discovered opiates and The Lord of the Rings. I think that was probably the zenith of childhood before the jarring cusp of reality and adulthood. I’m very happy now, but if I was forced to choose to relive one moment over and over again - it would probably be around there. I’m definitely romanticizing it in my head as things were not all good at that time, but it was before opiates kicked my ass and forced me to realize just how life altering they can be."
895,Am I fucked?,Adderall saved me and u don’t have to wait much longer now
896,Adderall saved me and u don’t have to wait much longer now,How did adderall save you?
897,How did adderall save you?,"You need 7 Xanax to comedown?
Yikes!!
The main thing that I had/have to have when I get up, is drive energyand motivation. That was the main thing I was gonna miss and a reason not to quit. 
When I told the sub dr that and told him that sometimes I could fall asleep standing. I work on elevators so that a big fuck no. He put me on adderall 60mg/ day and that got me back in the game. I’m not naive. It’s probably not something a recovering drug addict should be able to get there hands on but whatever I’ve been on them legally for 1.5yrs and fuck yea,  Ive been known to take the last 3 2weeks before my refill is available. But I’m a fuck up when it comes to drugs so what do ya expect. I’m not banging dope in my arms. But one thing at a time"
898,Am I fucked?,My sub doctor wouldn't let me start until benzos were out. U will most likely get tested..
899,Am I fucked?,Many of us have gona lot longer than what ur talking about
900,Am I fucked?,"Why would you go thru detox, and then go get re addicted to opiates with subs? Makes no sense bro. If youre already clean and out of the detox center then youre already over the most of the acute wds. Just tough it out another week and youll be feeling good again.

The whole point of subs is for people to switch to them without going thru detox then take the subs every day to replace shooting dope.  By starying subs youre eventuallu gonna have to detox off them eventually and sub detox is worse than dope detox."

As in, not having dope/fent/whatever in my system before I could join so I did I went to detox. Weird how they were giving me 8mg subutex in a detox place"
902,Would taking kratom while withdrawing from suboxone pro long how long I withdrawal for?,Short answer is yes. Long answer is its worth it. Just quit the kratom after a week or two and its not too bad. Or stay on for maintenance. Imo its better than subs and methadone bc youre basically sober and the wd isnt nearly as bad.
903,Short answer is yes. Long answer is its worth it. Just quit the kratom after a week or two and its not too bad. Or stay on for maintenance. Imo its better than subs and methadone bc youre basically sober and the wd isnt nearly as bad.,Okay thanks for the response. I'll do that
904,Short answer is yes. Long answer is its worth it. Just quit the kratom after a week or two and its not too bad. Or stay on for maintenance. Imo its better than subs and methadone bc youre basically sober and the wd isnt nearly as bad.,So I can fully get thru the suboxone withdrawals while on kratom then after a week or 2 I'll just have to deal with kratom withdrawals?
905,So I can fully get thru the suboxone withdrawals while on kratom then after a week or 2 I'll just have to deal with kratom withdrawals?,Yeah pretty much. I'd go at least 2 weeks. Bc sub wds are brutally long. Taper the kratom and the wd will be mild.
906,Would taking kratom while withdrawing from suboxone pro long how long I withdrawal for?,"My issue with Subutex is I'll be on it forever. Even my GP knows I can get high from it, by going 48hrs without and potentiating with diphenhydramine. That's why they won't give me z-drugs, cyclizine or anything above a week's worth of 2mg (two?!) diazepam."
907,Will kratom get me high?,"Yea, do around 4 g and you should feel a mild buzz"
908,Will kratom get me high?,"It's a different type buzz, but yeah itll give you something and 4gs sounds about right. I take 6 everytime I use it now but I'm taking it for chronic pain.Just look like dope I'm hooked on this shit now....."

910,Will kratom get me high?,"Personally, I dont think it compares at all, it helps with my chronic back pain, if it werent for that I'd not take it at all. Dont get me wrong, it will give you a rush, burst if energy, but it's not my type of burst. Like, these energy drinks and speedy pills I will not touch, adderall I'll take all day. Its just that difference for me."

912,Will kratom get me high?,You may like it? Just cause I dont think it's the same doesn't mean it wont work for you...
913,Will kratom get me high?,It may get you a small buzz. It may help kill some pain. But kratom is not a drug in the sense its gonna get you happily loaded. Too much and the wobbles make you wanna throw up very nasty powder . i take an ounce a day. I dont love it. Im better off with it. And i ussually wish i had a real drug. Kratoms great at what it is though. A tool.

959,Does alcohol potentiate opiates/oxycodone? I was drunk 3 hours ago from 3 beers but can't sleep now that they wore off. Safe to take 20mg oxy?,"Yes alcohol and opiates are very synergistic and potentiate each other. This is a multiplicative effect, not an additive. So you could be in danger mixing them. If you have opiate tolerance you should be perfectly fine assuming you drank ur last drink 3 hrs ago.

Edit: benzos, dxm and dph, promethazine and other antihistamines potentiate opiates. Would not at all recommend using benzos for this purpose but I do it whenever i have opiates anyways. Very dangerous"
960,Does alcohol potentiate opiates/oxycodone? I was drunk 3 hours ago from 3 beers but can't sleep now that they wore off. Safe to take 20mg oxy?,If you can get your hands on some seroquil or geodon youll be knocked on your ass for 10 hours. Best sleep youll ever get
961,Does alcohol potentiate opiates/oxycodone? I was drunk 3 hours ago from 3 beers but can't sleep now that they wore off. Safe to take 20mg oxy?,If you do decide to mix the two make sure you have some Oxsee for the next day because the hangover will be worse than a normal hangover

When I had strep throat i got a bottle of codeine and promethazine i drank the whole thing and had a great time lol with not much tolerance. I think it was over 200 mg of codeine. I bet you'd get a nice buzz from 90-120mg of codeine. Codeine is semi synthetic while tramadol is fully sysnthic if that makes a difference. Plus tramadol messes with your serotonin too"

973,Tramadol...worth it recreationally?,How often do you take Opiates? Would you consider yourself to have a high tolerance?
974,How often do you take Opiates? Would you consider yourself to have a high tolerance?,"I sporadically go through phases...for the past week I've been using 20g a day of Kratom and no ""official"" opiates.  When I do get my hands on Oxy...a single 30mg is perfect and I will take one in the morning and then another 30mg 5 hours later.  So not a high tolerance, but not a super low one either I guess?  Thanks for helping"
975,Tramadol...worth it recreationally?,"I wouldn’t say it’s worth it. Bit others enjoy it so you never know 🤷‍♂️😁 I used to eat 50mg, then 100mg every half hour up to 500mg

984,Tramadol...worth it recreationally?,"I can tell you:

Depends.

Tramadol **can** be amazing recreationally. Really. But not for everyone. Some people swear to god that Tramadol gives them a oxy like high (without tolerance obviously) ans some people don't feel it at all."
985,Tramadol...worth it recreationally?,"Tramadol and codeine. Each to their own I'm afraid. Try them and see.

Tramadol does shit all for me, and I'm prone to seizures so whenever I use it to bridge buprenorphine gaps I never go above 100mg per day. I've never got high from it. Sadly that's all my parents get now. No more unlimited codeine, then dihydrocodeine, then morphine, then fentanyl patches. Just Tramadol. 

Same with dihydrocodeine, on its own, I have never gotten high from it. Just a huge histamine reaction.

Now codeine is another story. I am an extremely efficient metaboliser so 32 hours off Subutex 300mg of codeine will give me a good buzz.

I have found codeine and dihydrocodeine to have good synergy for me. I find adding 200/300mg dihydrocodeine to the same codeine dose enhances the buzz, warmth and duration of the experience. I find with standard hayfever OTC anti-histamines it will dramatically reduce the histamine reaction.

Try everything you can in small doses to see what fits you. Each of us has a unique biochemistry and neurochemistry so each and every drug will affect each of us differently."
986,Anybody else tired of clogging the toilet EVERY DAMN TIME from opi shits?,"I've punished many a toilet in my hay-days of using... I notice Methadone tends to clog toilets the most for myself.  Lol, definitely a satisfying scenario when u r finally free of a 6lb block o waste 😒"
987,Anybody else tired of clogging the toilet EVERY DAMN TIME from opi shits?,"I smell you. I have an old lady living below me and when my toilet gets blocked she gets annoyed at me.  It's embarrassing. I don't even put tissue down there anymore and have to be sure to cut em up if they're too big... My neighbour seems to have trouble telling me though, which probably inconveniences her more than it does me seeing as I tend to smell the issue after she does. I mean absolutely, she shouldn't have to smell my shit, but she has to tell me there's an issue for me to be able to sort it out. I think she's nervous of me or something but still she could leave a note or put one through my letterbox. 

I find it's best to start by holding a large bucket of water about chest height then pouring it all at once into the bowl, that usually will dislodge stuff due to the pressure. Failing that some sort of acid designed for the problem. Can get strong sulphuric acid here which dissolves pretty much anything alive or dead, for now at least. That always does the trick but I'm not sure how good it is for the pipes or environment (not to mention my relations with my neighbour), so I try to make this a last resort."

1021,Is nodding out a sign of OD?,"When you ""nod"", you can be easily snapped out of it and be moderately coherant. A nodding person will snap out of it if they start to fall over or something like that. When you OD, you become unresponsive - usually called ""falling out"" as opposed to nodding. Nodding doesn't mean you're falling out by any means."
1022,Is nodding out a sign of OD?,"I think it depends on how you use the word overdose. If you're going to use it in a medically technical way, there are non lethal overdoses.

I personally prefer doses that don’t make you nod, but the occasional nod can be nice if you have nothing to do.
If someone’s breathing gets really shallow or stops and they are unresponsive is where things get dangerous. Some people also asphyxiate if they nod in a position that blocks their breathing fyi, so if you’re concerned about someone but they are not in any obvious danger just lay em back so they aren’t slumped over straining their breathing"

One of my dealers was actually one of the early Kratom distributors in the US so I used to get it for free when I requested it when I was copping.  That dude ended up paying an undercover agent a kilo of blow to kill his business partner, though, so that connect dried up fast."

1076,why not just do an actual proper taper instead of this shit seriously??,Cause I tried and I suck at tapering
1077,Cause I tried and I suck at tapering,tell me how you tried and failed? like what did you do specifically?
1078,why not just do an actual proper taper instead of this shit seriously??,I dont have any help either its just me myseld and I
1079,I dont have any help either its just me myseld and I,you yourself and you plus real opioids to try and detox bupe is even worse than just you yourself and you :/
1080,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,I got off bupe using kratom and had no withdrawals but now I'm addicted to kratom. Might work if you could actually quit after a week or two
1081,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,Yeah. I did this it worked for me but I didn’t use over a week. I got a gram and just rode it out. Took the edge off and used as little as possible tooting bumps until I was out.
1082,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,If your an addict it would be very hard not to develop another habit using this method.  I suggest getting some gabapentin really takes away withdrawal without starting another opiate habit.
1083,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,"Yes.  I could never get thru the bupe detox even at 1mg a day. I always used dope for while then detoxed from the dope. Even though the low dose bupe detox isnt as intense (id say it was like 50-60% intensity as a good dope habit detox) i just couldnt take the 2-3+ weeks of it.  Ive actually never known anyone to take subs longer than a week then taper off em n stay clean. In almost 20 years of using idk anyone to do it.  

My one sub doctor actually quit taking new patients for subs becsuse in like 8 years of prescribing subs he never had someone taper down and jump off them. He trulywanted to help people and every sub patient either failed drug tests or quit going when tapered down to 2-4mg"

I recently had a spinal fusion on my cervix, to make room for some tumors to have space, since they were pressing against some deep nerves.

I’m curious if you have ever looked into dissociatives for pain(ketamine, pcp or RC dissos) imo they are incredible for pain and can slow opioid tolerance if you use them together. They can be difficult to use and function if you aren’t experienced but I reckon they would be great just to switch things up every now and then cuz they actually stop you from feeling pain, rather than stop you from caring about the pain like opioids, and they don’t produce physical dependence.

Just food for thought cuz I know some people use 3ho-pcp and 3meo-pcp for pain."

1090,Is OD’ing painless?,"Sometimes the body is able to recover, and it’s rarely pretty.  I wouldn’t risk an OD"
1091,Is OD’ing painless?,"It probably depends on the amount you took. People who have survived OD'ing have described it as being pretty horrific. Going in and out of consciousness but being aware that you aren't breathing. I've experienced something pretty close to that. At the same time I have friends who have died with the needle still in their hand so I imagine they went pretty quickly without even realizing it was happening. At least I like to think that, but I guess I can't say for sure."

1102,Is OD’ing painless?,Nope it's painless. Until you wake up under an emt who just hit you with narcan and is screaming in your face and you have no idea what's going on but you feel fucking terrible and everyone around you hates you for doing that to them and the emt finds your needle in and sock and tells your mother then you spend the next few hours in pwds probably at the hospital just for them to treat you like shit and then you walk home in withdrawals and sit outside your house til someone let's you in?! Oddly specific. Yes. I know.

Dont risk it my dude."
1104,Is OD’ing painless?,"It can be, it depends on a lot of things

There’s also a chance you’ll wake up being hit with narcan by EMS or in a hospital. Then you’ll have precipitated W/D for a while.

Life’s hard, I’m really sorry you’re in the place you’re in (if your contemplating this). Stay strong, and good luck in life, even if all you did this week was steal from your loved ones and get high I’m proud of you **life is damn hard** and it’s hard to keep going, you’ve made it this far and I’d hate for you to become a statistic in this thing"

1109,Is OD’ing painless?,"Like many others have said...painless to pass out and then AWFUL if you survive.  Sometimes pharm doses can even be off 10%+/- and I took 2.5 - 40mg OXY when my normal recreational dose is 30mg thinking I'd be really high but good....had crazy nod, passed out, and woke up violently sick, throwing up, and my head hurt so bad I was scared I was dying. The vomiting was so intense it was the only time I've ever been scared for my life."
1110,Is OD’ing painless?,100% painless and not scary at all. It's actually kind of a bummer coming back to reality.
1111,Is OD’ing painless?,"It’s painless.  If you wake up, you won’t even remember it happening.  I’ve had tons of overdoses and multiple clinical deaths.

Problem with ODs, though, is they’re very rarely fatal.  Something like only 3% are fatal.  The rest of the time you wake up and when you have a severe OD and wake up, the results are often awful.

One time I woke up and my left arm didn’t work for three days, I was lucky I didn’t lose the arm.  Another time it was my left leg.  The leg went out for four days and would twitch and stomp whenever I put weight on it.  Again, lucky I didn’t lose the leg.

Even worse, I’ve lost use of parts of my face and head before too.  One time, the entire left side of my face went essentially dead.  It was hard as hell to open my eye and when I did, it was extremely painful and tears would flood down my face.  I also had no feeling in the top half of my head which was an extremely weird and oddly uncomfortable situation.

I do NOT recommend an OD and if you’re asking this because you’re considering it, reach out for help and find someone who cares and can assist you.  If you’re an addict, I know it can be hard to find such a person, but people do care about you.  If you legit don’t know anyone, fucking message me.  I’ve been there and it sucks, but your life is worth so much more."

The guy I saved from a fent tainted oxy OD didn’t even believe me when I told him everything that happened. One moment he was snorting a crushed pill and he said it felt stronger than he was used to and the next he was throwing up in the sink with me supporting his entire body weight many hours after. I was lucky to be able to keep him breathing. No recollection of not breathing and turning purple, no recollection of the repeated sternum rubs, no recollection of anything. I was lucky to have been able to keep him breathing and awake. Hospital was only an option if I couldn’t do that. I’ve never been so sore or exhausted. It was hours of walking while supporting a full grown mans body weight and giving pain stimulus to keep him going. Everyone else I’ve talked to says they just black out and come to with the paramedics. The going is painless because you likely won’t remember it (but very ugly and scary) but the coming to isn’t painless and equally as ugly and scary."

He said he seen me get out the car, talked to his dude and looked over and I was just gone. Like wtf. Here I’m in the road/ driveway, snoring between two cars, literally about to have told dude to not buy that bunk. Woke up in the ambulance after the third narcan."

1121,Is OD’ing painless?,"I’ve only ever OD’d on heroin, more specifically heroin laced with a lethal amount of fentanyl. I had no idea that I was OD’ing which I’m sure in part has something to do with the nodding; because when you’re nodding you’re unaware that you’re nodding until you come out of it. I just thought I was just really high. According to my boyfriend, I stopped breathing although I have no recollection of that or anything leading up to that. He did a sternum rub (hard enough to bruise me and scrape some skin off due to my clothes rubbing against my skin) and I didn’t feel a thing. 

The painful part was being narcanned honestly. I was narcanned twice by my boyfriend. Instantly I felt insanely nauseous, extremely cold and claustrophobic as hell. Felt like everything was closing in. I couldn’t walk and had a hard time talking or typing (I was trying to look up OD’ing symptoms of heroin and couldn’t spell for the life of me). I was made suddenly aware of my breathing which was incredibly shallow and chaotic. One second I was breathing very slowly and the next I was gasping for air. It was the shittiest I’ve ever felt in my entire life, so shitty that it’s turned me off of heroin altogether. It was traumatic in more ways than one. If it weren’t for being narcanned, I can honestly say that I probably would’ve just died without ever having known nor felt a thing."

Closest I've come is from alprazolam and not noticing a kitchen cabinet door was open. Hit it front on, broke my wrist on the way down and hit the back of my head on the floor. An inch or so from a countertop which would have killed me.

I still have the hollow on my forehead from the haematoma.

Whatever it is, it's not worth it. Take it from a dude who was in screaming agony for 7 years, no one believed me and I was taking 800mg codeine and 12 grammes of ibuprofen every day for years.

Two surgeries later, yes I'm out of work, but I have a family who support me, a wife you'd do anything for me and the buprenorphine keeps the beast at bay. Never getting off them just gone back up to 8mg from 6mg this week as I couldn't take the drop.

For first few weeks you do go to the doc 3 tines a week and if you give 8 weeks clean your put on the local GP who tests randomly,some dont bother and give you 4 weeks of scripts.  And i think its just cheaper to keep people on it. 
Its very addictive and dangerous to people with low tolerance.
60 mls would kill lots of people. In on 65 and its the fear of WDs that stalls most  from getting off.
If your on it not too long and do it with doctors help it can be done.

If you take high doses it can be dissociative or deletion inducing.

I've only tried tapentadol more recently, got 20 of em for dirt cheap 👍,  I've read a ton about higher dosages causing seizures, so I tread lightly (for me this meant I.Ving one tablet, popping 2 begin) I was dope sick at the time, but I will say, they absolutely took away all of my w\ds👍 but I can't definitively say I'd rate them Superior to tramadol... Hard to compare, as I've had sooo many more trams, and taken them for recreation & pain, when I'm sick the line between feeling better\getting high gets blurry! I am guilty of over indulging when I'm sick and jumping from w\d to falling out w\little in between.. lol. If they don't break the bank, I'd recommend;)"
1177,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"I have tried tapentadol a few times as well as tramadol. I do not like tramadol at all, because of the serotonin effects and weak MOR agonism. It's the only opioid I will always refuse, so far. I found tapentadol a completely different beast and very pleasurable. Stronger and much more of a proper mu opioid agonist than tramadol. I think the biggest dose I had, with little tolerance at the time, was 100mg orally, which was quite strong for me. Went into a very pleasant deep nap."
1178,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"tramadols older, hotter, more ripe cousin IMO. i loved tapentadol before i wrecked my tolly. also helped my pain fwiw"
1179,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"The only time in my life I’ve had auditory hallucinations was once on tapentadol.

It was warmer than tramadol (and more potent) but my tolerance was high enough at that point that I didn’t get very high from them."
1180,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"That’s Nucynta homie.  It’s sort of like Tramadol, but stronger and a lot less side effects (and risk of side effects).  It’s strength is around that of Vicodin I believe, might want to double check that, but it produces a high most similar to a weak Oxycodone.

I’d say go wild.  They can be fun, especially if you have a low tolerance or fuck mostly with pills (e.g., if you’re a Perc or Vic user mostly you should be able to get a hit out of em)."

You know, I’m not sure. I’d like to say I’d keep my wits and do what I currently believe to be the right thing. Though,I have no idea what boat loads of money and the responsibility that corporate shareholders’ satisfaction would do to me.  I’d like to say I’d do what’s right for the overall human satisfaction or continuity but it’s not something I can accurately say. I’m not in that position yet. I’m sure everyone going there would say the same thing; “I’m not sure”. 

>	Are you ok with having to fire people, some of whom you may even be friendly with?

Yes. I’m not there to be buddy buddy. I have seen a coworkers come and go, some nice and some that deserved to be let go. It’s a game. It’s a business. You either put in work or you’re shown the door. I have no problem being a strongarm. 

I do opiates when I have them from the pharmacy. I have 3 herniated discs and a tumor located on my spine. The pain is unbearable most days and opiates are a significant help to me. They provide stability in my life and some clear moments of content. I’m not a junkie or anything but I do do opiates and I’ve come here to get more insight into the life of opiates in general. This sub has been a huge help to me.

A lot of shops are buying bulk flavorless ejuice, as well as nicotine and flavor shots sold separately, customer combines it themselves. I worry that if i invest in doing sales this way, the governor will just end up banning that as well. I am willing to bet in 6 months when they ""review"" the ban that we will be able to get juice again but it will be FDA approved, and they will tax the shit out of it just like cigs. We don't make anything in cigarettes, it all goes to the state. I personally think it is about money, not health. If it was they would ban alcohol and real cigs too.

I worry that if i invest in doing sales this way, the governor will just end up banning that as well. I am willing to bet in 6 months when they ""review"" the ban that we will be able to get juice again but it will be FDA approved, and they will tax the shit out of it just like cigs. We don't make anything in cigarettes, it all goes to the state. I personally think it is about money, not health. If it was they would ban alcohol and real cigs too. Also think the timing is weird seeing as marlboro just bought 38% of juul and the ceo of Marlboro is now the ceo of juul.",Wish you the best of luck man.  And its definitely all about the money.

It seems like you are using a fuck ton of times a day. If you are trying to taper I would definitely start cutting out two times of use a week. So you use before you leave for work. Don’t do that anymore cut that one out too. Also cut out using after the 10 am meeting. If you only want to cut out one time a week that would take much longer though. So how about you cut out two times each for the first three weeks then the next two weeks only cut out one use and you will end up using when you wake up and when you go to sleep. Or just cut one more out and you will use three times a day just in case you start to feel sick halfway thru your workday. Hope this helps.

I'm always way too high at work. Falling asleep 1 minute into a meeting while standing up, nearly falling sometimes.

Unfortunately I'm no longer a secret addict since my parents found the needles. They're the only people I wish never knew. I don't care if the rest of the world knows. I just feel so bad letting them down.

1384,Are new heroin users being made a lot these days? are they young? do they go str8 to heroin/fent instead of pills?,"Yes, your assumptions are pretty much correct, although the rate of new H addicts has declined due to the prevalence of OD's in the media and all the stigma that Heroin carries these days (excessive if you ask me, not referring to Fentanyl of course). I think as doctors prescribe less and less, the number of new Opioid addicts will level off.

There are still approximately 1.5 Million Opioid addicts in the US as opposed to 400-500K before the Opioid epidemic created so many new & young ones, so the market will still be bigger than it has been in a long time (probably ever) but thankfully teens have less of a chance to be exposed through pills that flooded the illicit market like 10 years ago.

Of course things can change or even reverse in a decade or possibly even less time, but for the next 5 years or so it seems like the illicit Opioid user group will be pretty stable. One thing is for sure, the illicit Opium and refined Opioid industry has certainly grown and earned a lot of poor farmers and others a lot of our money - there are many new people getting involved in the business as they see others benefiting from it, whether it's a peasant farmer in Mexico or a cartel associate refining a Kilogram."

1389,Are new heroin users being made a lot these days? are they young? do they go str8 to heroin/fent instead of pills?,About 5-10 years ago one of the high schools used to have a serious speedball problem where kids were buying speedballs then transitioned to just straight heroin and those classes that graduate make up the majority of opiate users in my area but a lot of younger kids have easy access to presses and it just makes transitioning to heroin seems so much easier and rational in their mind. That’s how I came to be a heroin user (age range 18-22) but I’ve been an addict of Vicodin and percs since I was 14. It really all varies. I know people willing to try heroin as long as it’s not cut up with bullshit like fent bc it’s cheaper and lasts longer quantity wise. Sorry for the ramble I know I was all over the place lol.

Infact out of my 20 or so circle of friends, one ended up straight on Heroin from other drugs like weed/coke -  I was the nerdy one who started off CWEing codeine then progressed to darkweb oxy.

Over here weed is the common drug, then cocaine. Also party drugs like MDMA.  Nobody uses Heroin or other opiates, other than the stereotype of the homeless H addict.

I left some oxy 40's in my office in work, the cleaners tidied my office and just left them on my desk. The boss came in and left a note on my desk about work, ignored the pills.  Nobody here even knows what oxy is. They were just generic painkillers to them. Here, ""illegal drugs"" are a powder or a plant.

1393,Are new heroin users being made a lot these days? are they young? do they go str8 to heroin/fent instead of pills?,"So here's what happened with me, started experimenting with pain pills at 18 but it never really became an ""addiction"" because of the scarcity. Tried heroin for the first time at 21 only because it was much easier to find and much cheaper too, and it became an ""addiction"" very quickly for that very reason. I'd imagine it would be the same for many young people. Most 18 year old kids aren't just going to experiment with heroin for the hell of it. But if they try pills first, they already know what to expect and the concept of heroin becomes way less scary.

I couldn't imagine going through a full blown pill addiction phase. Waaay too expensive. I've known people who had perc habits that cost hundreds of dollars a day"

Obv that’s just my experience and from what I’ve seen I’m the few. I’ve seen a few kids that are wild and will take anything and everything offered to them, few of them tried the wrong shit and ended up with addictions but for the most part they’ll still start with pills"

1425,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"I'll throw in my 2c having been in similar situations. I think most people are correct in that leaving him and moving on will be your best bet. One is that he will probably always choose the drug before you. Two is that you're not his caretaker, it is not your duty or obligation to make sure he's safe, okay, whatever. And third, is even if he gets clean (which I doubt you've ever known him while truly clean), he may not even be the same guy you fell in love with. Drugs change who you are and how you act. When I'm clean I'm completely different from when I'm using*. And honestly, I had much better luck dating when I used heavily. More chatty, better mood, more calm and relaxed, less libido so not nervous around partners, etc. When I'm sober I'm a completely different person than that. Especially if he's using to self-medicate, finding the drugs that make him feel ""well"" might be a longer process than you're willing to stick with.

All and all, you're young, barely an adult really. You don't need to waste your time trying to save a junkie who doesn't want to fix himself. You deserve better and you shouldn't get caught up in the sunk-cost fallacy of thinking all this time will be a waste if you leave. Holding his hand can be just as harmful as leaving him outright, really depends. Bottom line is he won't get clean for you, for his mother, for his future kids, for anyone other than himself. No addict will. So let him figure it out and if he becomes a man you can love then maybe you can let him back in your life."

I’m all for relationships but this one just seems problematic, and aside from the obvious problems everyone else is already going to point out, I just wanted to highlight that you’re at an important stage in your life. During college, you have school and your social life to focus on; if you add in a problematic relationship, you’re not going to have time for all three. These could be the best years of your life (they were for me, I’m not just repeating an annoying cliche)... don’t waste them on someone who is more focused on heroin than you anyway."
1429,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"Definitely leave the dude and dont look back. I dated a girl a lot like you (well, given the limited info I have about you) the first time I started to get strung out. That was 10 years ago, long enough that it shouldn't matter to me any more (certainly doesn't matter to her I'm sure), and I still wish I'd just broken up with her or just never started dating her to begin with. She was this bright light of happiness, genuine care for others and sweetness unlike anyone I'd ever met. I watched myself dim that light over the course of a year and didn't even realize it until a year after she dumped me finally. I've never stopped regretting it and still feel I haven't redeemed myself from it, probably never will. I cant/dont want to imagine what was going on in her head during that time. It makes my head hurt and stomach roll over. Unless you want to be dimmed too, definitely leave this dude."
1430,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"First off, I'm very sorry about your situation. I'm actually a recovering addict with almost six years of clean time, and I'm still trying to fix the relationships I destroyed. If he's already injecting it then he's not going to ever get clean until he truly hits bottom and wants to change. You're young, and it sounds like you love him. My advice to you is to tell him that he needs to get clean and sober, or you're going to leave him. I'm sure my advice sounds harsh, but I do know that I've hurt so many people when I was using drugs. I'm not a liar, and I'm not a thief. But I was both of those things when I needed another fix to prevent going into withdrawal. I've seen so many people who ruined not only their own lives, but the lives of their loved ones as well. So, I guess it comes down to how much you truly love him. I wish you the best and I hope he chooses you and his family over death and destruction."
1431,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,Run...seriously he has a long path to travel to have any chance of getting togeather and he may never.  You need to love from a distance so he doesn't drag you down with him.
1432,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"""Can we just be friends?"""
1433,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"Get as far away from this guy as possible. You’re a freshman in college with your whole life in front of you. He’s a grown man dating a child (I assume you were having sex with him before you were 18) and crashing in her dorm room because he has no where else to stay. No judgement here (on you, but definitely on him) but you have to run. He’s in the midst of active addiction, where many of us have been. He needs a lot more help than you can give him."
1434,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,Wait why is a 24 year old dating someone who turned 18 while they were dating. Little bit predatory.
1435,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,Move on. Don’t let this guy drag your life down. I know he probably seems worldly or some other bullshit - don’t let him fuck your life up. You can do better. He is living in your dorm without a job injecting heroin. Come one. Wake up!
1436,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,Pmd
1437,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"Hes a child predator and you're ridiculously naive. dump the fuckin loser jfc he doesnt give half of a shit about you. How is that hard to understand. Keep it up and you'll find out what real misery is. Like this is the situation you read about on this sub from the dudes perspective where its a thinly veiled brag about how much of a stud they are for leading some naive fool on into supporting their ridiculous habit. Most of the time cheating the whole time; only ever showing remorse because they got caught and lost their free meal ticket. Also if you want a relationship to work, little psa but forcing someone to give up everything they love for you isnt a good way to endear yourself."

I'm not saying you're in any sort of wrong for skimming meds the patient didn't need. I'm saying that overprescribing seems almost as bad (not fully as bad because at least the patient gets their relief) as underprescribing.

 but I know all too well that way too many 40-60yo docs are just praying that their rampant coke habits go undiscovered... something distracting to remember that next time one of them looks you dead in the eye when you present with a compound fracture at the ER & Dr. Lamborghini asks you ""have you ever had torodol?""

I’ve just met a few veterans where I live and they got oxy pretty easily and was just surprised by that. Opiate prescriptions r very strict where I live but not unreasonable. I had a kidney stone and they gave me 10 hydros which was more than enough bc the pain came back one time. That being said the did the whole xray to see if I actually had a kidney stone before prescribing anything.

There is way too much stigma in the US regarding Opioids, the public needs to realize they are not even that dangerous, nor toxic to the body.

1453,If you relapse after seven days off heroin will you withdrawl?,Probably not. Mentally it might stick with ya. Most people who relapse.. Use again the next day or day after that and are back to the races. Try not to be another statistic. Or at least make another week!
1454,If you relapse after seven days off heroin will you withdrawl?,A good possibility.ive went back into wd after 10 days ..
1455,If you relapse after seven days off heroin will you withdrawl?,"If you had a decent habit before that, yes unfortunately you will. It won't be exactly like starting over but IME it'll push you back to day 3 or so if you went without anything for 7 days. It's not worth it."

1457,Yeah I mnot going to. I also did subs for 4 days and stopped I’m counting that in the 7 days.,"I think the subs are still slowly leaving your system, or they have just about left.   So IMO if you used once, you have a very big chance of putting yourself back in withdrawals.

It won't put you back in Day 1 so you have to do it all over again (that is a myth - or tapers would never work)  - but it will set you back enough you'll regret it.

TBH I was 11 or 12 days completely clean once, and I relapsed on day 12 - and on day 13 I still felt a little bit icky and unwell.  After 1 dose.  I'd wait at least 2 weeks."
1458,If you relapse after seven days off heroin will you withdrawl?,"That is super dependent on how long you used before, how much you usually used/used again when relapsed, etc.

1494,Avoid sweating massively when on opiates?,Also the sweating is caused a combo of our temperature regulation being fucked because thats just what opiates do and also I assume slight withdrawal caused by the drug leaving your body when your busy doing other things the only way to stop it is to stop doing oxy Im pretty sure
1495,Avoid sweating massively when on opiates?,"Don't let people get to you, sometimes you'll see a post like this and nobody will say anything about your dosage. And other times everybody decides to jump on you. If you wanna try going cold Turkey then that's what you should try doing. If it doesn't work out, I wish you the best of luck on the subs. Anyway back to your question. I found this with a pretty quick Google search. Maybe try some Benadryl?

""Opioids: Opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone and Dilaudid are a well-known cause of excessive sweating. Why? Opioids stimulate a type of immune cell known as mast cells that release histamine, the same chemical involved in inflammation, and that in turn leads to sweating."" Jul 31, 2018"
1496,Avoid sweating massively when on opiates?,"I cold turkeyed 4mg of sub a day for 2-3 years for 6 weeks before I relapsed out of boredom and because I started smoking weed again. It's totally possible to cold turkey a hard habit if you've got real will power. Most NPCs here on reddit will tell you ya have to go to rehab for 90 days and it's literally impossible on your own, but that aint true. Ive cold turkeyed many hard habits, xanax, massive kratom habit, suboxone, oxy, etc. It's not that hard if you're actually determined to stop."

1507,Anybody else have nightmares?,"I almost never remember my dreams. But I usually know if they were pleasant or not as I'm waking up. So I can say yes, I have definitely been having some sort of unpleasant dreams a lot lately."
1508,Anybody else have nightmares?,I've had sleep paralysis and night terrors ever since I spent a bunch of time in the hospital watching my daughter's body give up. After the first week or so staying in that room since her mother wouldn't/couldn't it started to really fuck me up. Enough dope puts me out enough if I do dream I sure as hell don't remember it.
1509,Anybody else have nightmares?,"No, but I have dreams that I’ll find a stash of oxy and be pretty bummed when I wake up."

1516,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,My suggestion is to just leave him be. Clearly if trying to talk to him only upsets you are not going to reason with someone in WD. He is miserable and misery loves company. I mean from what you are saying this is only his behavior during WD. Why even bring it up if it only lasts a few days.
1517,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,I turn into a real asshole while I’m in wds I don’t mean to be It just happens i get very irritatable and short no matter what I’m doing or who it is I hate being That way but it just happens

1520,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,"I get the same way as boyfriend and am generally pretty mean, however, that’s not an excuse and I personally don’t think you should deal with it (even if you may or may not deserve it) and definitely need to bring up the conversation about possible rehab or getting clean. Ultimately what’s the point in dating if you don’t have some sort of thought about a future together, and unfortunately it’s usually next to impossible to change somebody you love that’s in active addiction. Wether realizing it or not, you are inevitably going to come second always, I just hope you figure this out on your own without needing to be stung first. Just my opinion though!"
1521,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,"Honestly, don’t try talking to him about anything serious, or having any prolonged discussions, while he’s in withdrawal.  Withdrawal completely fucks with your mental state and brain chemistry so he’ll be in rare form and likely won’t be able to convey any real feelings, just artificial anger and depression.

Save the serious shit for when he’s dried out.  During withdrawal, keep things superficial and short.  I know that when I’m in withdrawal, it’s hard for me to even hold a superficial conversation and I often get pissed off just having to engage with people for any prolonged period of time."
1522,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,"When your puking your ring up last thing your gonna give is a nice response to anything,,Fuck off being my default reply.
Its Not a good time to bring up anything responsible if you dont want to be rebuffed."
1523,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,Limit interaction with him.  Wait for him to initiate contact if possible.  Don't put up with any bullshit abusive treatment though.  Just because he's miserable doesn't give him the right to lash out at you for nothing.

1535,"Any reason why they won’t potentiate? because what I’ve read and heard is that antihistamines potentiate opiates hence the promethazine in lean. 

Cheers mate ❤️","They don't ""potentiate"" what they do is make you more sleepy and it makes you nod off more easily. But it's not a technical potentiator. Technically potentiaters fight for the same enzymes in your body, which makes your blood plasma level of the medication go up. What you're talking about is more polypharmacy sedation.
Edit...cant type"
1536,"Any reason why they won’t potentiate? because what I’ve read and heard is that antihistamines potentiate opiates hence the promethazine in lean. 

Cheers mate ❤️","They do not potentiate in the pharmacological sense. A true potentiator inhibits or induces the livers enzymatic system in one way or another. E.g the typical one grapefruit juice (white being best for furanocourmarins) which affects the P450 cytochromes of 3a4 and 2d6, these are the most common for metabolising opioids etc.

Antihistamines can have a synergy, where for example your morphine (enzymatically produced from the Codeine) is made more sedating accompanied with Promethazine etc. Personally finding synergy in combinations is far more common and usually results in great results. My favourite being gabapentoids with Opioids.

Hope this helps!"

And that first time will always feel special (even though my memory of it is miles off) but but my strongest/best highs have been lately now that I kind of know what I can use

Saying that though il never get a wicked codeine high again, laying in bed all warm and snuggly and smiling. That’s never going to happen 🤷‍♂️"
1571,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,"Probably remembering it as better than it was, since this is strait not facts"

I mostly use tramadol and codeine, but I like to take oxy probably once a week on average. If I go a week or two without any opiates, taking oxy will probably be 90 percent as good as the first time.

For instance, today is the first time in 10
Days in which I have taken any opiates and I took 40 mg of oxy. And right now, I almost can’t imagine the high being any better.

The tram and coroner high for me was never as good as the oxy or even endone high. Tramadol high made me , I dunno, more jittery?"
1574,"All good! I used mostly the same as I could get it from my doctor. The tram and coroner high for me was never as good as the oxy or even endone high. Tramadol high made me , I dunno, more jittery?","Yeah, I also get them from my doctor for pain. I agree, the high from tramadol and codeine is far away from
Oxy. I dont really like codeine, as it only give me sedation with no euphoria. Tramadol gives me a lot of euphoria, but I also get jittery, sweaty and etc. So I usually just take them as prescribed. 

But one of my friends actually prefers tramadol over Oxy and morphine"
1575,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,Not true... still loved getting high the thousandth time. Never understood people that said “chasing the first rush only to never achieve it”... I def achieved it and surpassed it many a times... that’s why I stayed getting high!
1576,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,You only get to discover something once.
1577,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,"This hasn't been my experience at all.  Every time is like the first time & I've been using (low doses) for 15 years now.  Hydro/oxycodone, codeine, kratom, dihydrocodeine... whatever pills I can get.  They all give me a nice hypomanic energy in low doses that makes me over the moon.  

I think abusing anything will make it less effective.  Basic law of tolerance.  This is why people 'chase the dragon' for years in search of that first high but it's never to be found again.  For me, weed has been the most dramatic in this regard.  No high from ANY substance will ever be as powerful & amazing as my first weed high.  Now it just makes me anxious & paranoid :\"

1580,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,"This isn't a fact whatsoever. If someone uses the same exact dose say once every 4-12 weeks, and get this, actually follows through on only using once every 4-12 weeks, they can easily use for a decade or more without their tolerance going up all that much. I used to use just 20mg hydrocodone or 15mg oxycodone once every 4 weeks on average of \~8-9 months per year like clockwork for roughly \~6-8 years, before I eventually found access to cheap international darknet opium and ultimately obliterated my tolerance and started using daily/near-daily. It's only once you use near-daily or at least 1-2x per week for months or years, particularly in high doses, that you tend to develop permanent or pseudo-permanent tolerance."
1581,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,Abstain for a year or two then bang a Dilly or two. That will do the trick. It won't be as good as the first time but it will probably be very remarkable.

1583,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,"If I haven’t shot up/used opiates in 3 months + when I do, at a sufficient dose, I get a high just like the first time... only with IV though"
1584,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,"Its all about whether you have opiates in your body or not. If you use daily then there's just always some opiates on your brains receptors but if you wait a week therell be none on your receptors.

Going from 0 to 100 is more noticeable and more intense than going from 50 to 100.  That's why when you are sick you feel it really good but if you already used recently its not as much of a change.  I always felt like the first use after a week or more felt just as good as a first time use"
1585,Methadone & Clonidine ?,"I can't answer for methadone in particular because I don't take it, But clonidine does not really potentiate opiates, it just makes you sleepier and more likely to nod off because it tanks your blood pressure. It's really useful for withdrawals but not really as a potentiator. Maybe somebody will come on here and correct me but no...it would not be worth taking with an opiate and possibly dangerous. And no they would not test for it on a your ua. It's a very commonly prescribed blood pressure medicine"

I was just wondering because I used to live in Baltimore and I’d hear that they’d take Clonidine with their methadone. It was called like the “bmore cocktail” or something.
1588,Methadone & Clonidine ?,Try a Benadryl. It is relatively safe and increases sedation.

1590,"Ever had intestinal issues because of opiate constipation? Fecaliths, Appendicitis etc?","After like 10 abdominal surgeries and cancer my muscles there are weak af. I’m on about 120 mg of oxy Ir a day and if I get an impaction, i literally do not have the strength to get it out. I tried laxatives, teas, prescription meds for opiate constipation and the only thing that works for me is a mineral oil enema. It basically lubes you up so whatever is in there can slide right out."

1592,"Appendicitis is right lower quadrant, not left.","Indeed, but Wikipedia says that it starts as unlocalized visceral pain that slowly manifests on the right side. Well, I just got scared and probably don't have anything, no discomfort or pressure today. Every time I have some physical issue, I start reading online and get paranoid, thinking I have cancer and other grave ailments. I have been a bit obsessed with Tetanus lately as I get small cuts frequently (working DIY projects, fixing my bicycle etc.) and then I end up doing some gardening without latex gloves and open ""wounds""...I should just chill a little :P"

The MOD team can't see who is doing it, but the admin team can. I have communicated with the admin team about it in the past but there isn't much they can do and this has been an issue for a long, long, long time. You are right. Someone is very petty and has some unreasonable vendetta against me. That's all I can imagine in regards to it.

>Also, I decided to take it upon myself and upvoated all of those comments that were zeros or in the negative because fuck whoever is doing this to you!

Can I just say WOW?! You did an amazing job, I scrolled through my profile and it looks like you basically fixed it. How long did you spend doing that!? I appreciate it so much. 

>I really hope you don’t let it get you down, though I’m sure it’s hard for it not to. But it would be a truly big loss if you decided to stop participating here all because some immature asshole has a stick so far up their ass they’ve lost any sanity completely. 

I typically don't let it get me down and still participate a lot here. It can be upsetting though when I have something important to say and it gets buried. I also think there's a ""voting mentality"" where if people see a few downvotes they jump on the bandwagon and contribute to it by downvoting, and if people see a few upvotes they contribute to it by upvoting...

I don't know, but it is what it is, if anything can be learned from it, you get farther in life when you're respectful of others. I'm a huge believer in Karma. I've been through a lot. Some of it has been self-inflicted and I take responsibility for that. However, it seems I've got a lot of good karma headed my way.

1670,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,"I think a lot of people internalize the stigma that is placed on them by non-addicts and in turn demonize fellow addicts. When people are treated like the bottom of the barrel, sometimes they react by wanting to feel like there’s someone beneath them too. (Could be in part a control issue here). I’m not excusing this behavior or condoning it by any means, simply trying to examine where the hate is coming from. I also think it’s entirely displaced anger since we cannot always get mad at those who put us down or fight back against the loved ones who think little of us so we come onto Reddit and unload here. You also make a good point about how often times anonymity makes it easier for us to be much more hateful when you do not have to suffer any consequences for your actions since no one knows your name and you don’t risk losing  any kind of reputation. There is also the fact that drug addiction itself is tiring and hardening. I have experienced people’s wrath simply bc they were WDing and obviously bitter about it and needed a proverbial punching bag.

1703,When d-boy gives u a bundle in one bag ??,I only lived on the east coast for a few months but when I'd weigh out a stamp is was generally between a .08-.15 so I think it just kind of depends. Tbh I think the whole stamp bag thing is stupid I'd rather just get it all in one bag.
1704,When d-boy gives u a bundle in one bag ??,Where I'm at buns ate 25. So a bun mite be quarter gram but like everything in the north east its straight fent. 10 years ago a 50$ bun was atleast 400mg
1705,Heroin with no legs?,"Here are the fents that DS strips recognize


Fentanyl • Butyryl-fentanyl • Tetrahydrofuran fentanyl• Acrylfentanyl • Cyclopropylfentanyl• Acetylfentanyl • 3-Methylfentanyl • Carfentanil • Sufentanil • β-OH-thiofentanyl • Furanylfentanyl • p-Flourofentanyl • Flouroisobutyryfentanyl"

But yes, it is absolutely correct that there could be an analogue that is not tested by the strip in your dope. I am not very well versed in anything beyond test strips as far as guaranteeing the lack of fentanyl, though. But honestly if your dope has no legs it's more than likely fent or an analogue. I got a batch of fentanyl dope a few months back and I couldn't fucking enjoy it because I swear to God by the time I was finished sniffing the shit it was out of my system lol.

1720,What's everyones opinion on the most effective way to do multiple times!?!,"Best way possible, get a 3ml-5ml oral syringe (doesn’t matter which kind), put the dry cottons all in the barrel, draw up 30-40 units of water so they are nice and submerged, and leave half the plunger down for room and shake it for a minute or so. Then simply squeeze the solution into ur spoon (this way you can squeeze every last bit) and I recommend wheel filtering for any cotton shots. However if it’s within 12-16 hours you shouldn’t get sick. Never seen anybody else make up cottons like my method before, and when I was still using I showed tons of people. Hope this helps."

1726,What will 7.5/325 Oxy do?,"You won’t feel much, if anything. You can attempt to manage pain with OTC tools, but if that doesn’t work and you decide to use what was prescribed, you should be fine taking one or half a pill.

There should be very little Euphoria if any at all. You may get some relaxation,  which will help your recovery. Good luck!!"
1729,What will 7.5/325 Oxy do?,"honestly I got hooked on just 60mg of codeine.  60mg of codeine is a tiny negligible dose, I barely noticed it - but when I was sat playing a video game after the drug, I noticed something was different. I was more content, I felt good.   A few days later I remembered this being odd and researched codeine.

Pandoras box was opened and now my tolerance is 480mg of oxycodone a day. plus dihydrocodeine, and tramadol.    Literally off that 60mg dose. I remember it like it was yesterday."

It lead to me thinking that it was all my fault. And inevitably we ended up using together cause I was too weak to say no. The relationship ended horribly and we don't speak anymore. Took some time to get over it all due to some circumstances that were out of my control.

Maybe initially I wouldn't bring it up on the first date, but I've never lied about my use to my long time girlfriend. She inspires me to do better. I look up to her because she's growing as a person and it makes me want to change. I started using fairly young, myself and was lucky enough to have a supportive family/girl who I can trust.

I've felt guilty about letting her ""party too hard"" but at the same time accept responsibility to the fact that I am the source of these party favours and it's up to me to keep her safe if I'm doing anything w her. You have plenty of options, good luck homie."
1770,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"**Start getting shit done and it won't matter!** I'm a decade into this. First just weed and pills for five years and then suddenly im doing oxy and banging street dope for another five, grew weed and did crime to feed my habit(not in the US, Im European), but you know how it goes.... I met a girl, and she got me straight.... No, not sober. She is though.  But I promised that I will never ever again commit a crime that harms another person physically or financially. She's tried to make me quit several times, but it never works for long. My longest is a month. This just seems to be how Im wired (I know its because my brain is fucked up from all the dope, spare me). So anyway I'm still doing drugs whats my point here? My point is, that is it really your addiction thats stopping you, or is the addiction just an excuse for you to not do anything else. because the dope helps you not care about what a loser you are? Really ask yourself. Why are you not doing anything with your life? is it because all your time is spent chasing drugs and shooting up? Well that is straight up bullshit. I am just now finishing a college god damn degree, from a good school no less, right now and I am a stone cold crazy speedballin' junkieman, and if I can do it, anyone else can. You will feel better about yourself and your life once you start getting things done! You'll rely less on drugs, and maybe eventually reach some kind of stability? Maybe start slow and just go outside for walks or something each day, get a shit job or something, just do something *besides* dope.

Your girlfriend will love you for it. And if she really does love you, she will be angry with you and there will be fights, but she won't leave as long as you try. Once you stop trying they're gone, man. You can have a good relationship with someone who does not use, as long as you put in the same effort they do but thats just every relationship. If one person isn't putting in any effort in that relationship it is DOA.  You also don't lie about your use constantly. You can never lie about it really, you have to be as honest as possible. Just tell them that you're noddy because you did H not because you're sleepy, just fucking say it. They will be mad but telling them is far better than lying and building up that poisonous doubt. If you are doing things in your life that are not just drugs then you might just be fine. My relationship works because my girl understands that i have serious anxiety issues that have to be treated some way, and the medical system has fucked me over so bad i refuse to see a doctor and so i ""self-medicate"". I also have pains from various injuries and a bad back. So she knows about the opiates and the benzos and has tried to get me to quit but she has kind of given up. I mean, i cause no trouble, I am always good to her, and I work my ass off both at work and school, do my absolute best to at least appear sorta normal around her and she appreciates that. However, sometimes I just splurge and will be a mess, but If all I did was lay around and shoot dope like i did before i met her... she would leave immediately.

So sometimes i choose and embrace the dirty junkie that i am, and at others i try to focus on more productive things, like higher learning. See, i think this is the problem and one huge mistake, an assumption that people make that you can only be either or. You're either a dirtbag do nothing junkie, or you hold down a decent job and have a functioning life with a wife devoid of anything that might accidentally be pleasurable. Me, i happen to have accomplished something inbetween as far as it seems, though its likely that i will die of some sort of overdose at a young age, i do combinations of huge doses of stuff that should kill me, like at least oxy 180mg crushed, some ketamine, alotta benzoz and at least a handle of whiskey, all at the same time which is mostly why my gf hates what i do, but she understands why and where its coming from, and thats just the best thing. And i respect her respecting me, by never ever doing that shit around her. Maybe that's the secret to our relationship really? idk. but if ur person doesn't like you getting high, don't get high in their presence.

But god damn stop making excuses, if you're the kind to just lay around. The only reason you haven't done something is because you haven't put the effort in, life's hard for everybody so buckle up bucko and earn that speedball at the end of the week. Think of your drug ""problem"" thats keeping you down instead more of as a ""reward system"", that you get for working hard. It will actually trick your brain, because you want that reward right... you NEED it... so go do your damn shift.

You will have more respect for yourself, and your girlfriend will respect you also, if you just keep at it and get stuff done. This isn't even some ""bootstraps"" speech, you might have a shit job your whole life... but holding that job down will mean something."

It's destroyed me but I'm stuck. I hate her having this hold over me as if I tell anyone it will ruin her. We have a child and I do not know if she is safe to look after her some days. There's no talking to her about it as she is a compulsive deluded liar in fear of losing everything...and by everything I mean sometimes her next hit/fix/hand full of tablets. 

So if you're worried then there's obviously something to worry about. You will at some point have to choose. Junkie or not. Or...just find yourself a user as a partner and spiral into coma's together safe in the knowledge that you both used and it wasn't your fault."
1773,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"The short and honest answer is yes, in my opinion. It’s probably possible for it not to be in very unique circumstances, but for most cases, it is selfish.

It’s a complicated question, to be sure. Rationalizations that one is protecting the other from pain in some way are just too easy to believe in, in the face of the challenges addiction presents."

1852,"This is completely wrong, bupe tolerance does not build fast. If bupe tolerance went up fast, so would your dosage when on Suboxone.  Bupe is used because you do not have to continue to increase dosage.","No you’re not totally wrong. What I meant as for your tolerance going up fast, recreationally, your tolerance will build in that sense.

It will still be affective for maintenance treatment, and will be useful even at a lower dose, you just won’t get high. So yeah I’m not wrong but you’re also not right.","No your wrong, your talking about half life. When using recreational opiates they have a short half life, allowing you to get ""high"" and then come down ""low"" over a period of about 8-12 hours. Bupe's half life is incredibly long, for an opiate, so, over a period of say 24 hours, one dose of bupe will keep you ""high."" Taking bupe every 4 days or so allows you to dose, get high, come down and then repeat the process. If you dose bupe every other day or every day, you don't really come down you stay in a perpetual high which after a week or so, doesn't feel like you're high anymore, it becomes your new normal. So, you remove the Bupe and you get WDs. 

The other reason bupe is prescribed is because it also has a ceiling. For me, it's 8mg or so. Meaning, I can take 60mg and feel no difference between them.
TLDR: Bupe is used because people do not have to keep increasing dosage, and because it's safe with a ceiling, preventing ODs unless you combine with something like a benzo."

So when I would take it recreationally, I’d have about 3 days I could feel it then it wouldn’t do anything but I would need to wait 2 weeks or so before I could get high off it again. That’s where the tolerance from it would be built up. It still would have an affect on me and not allow me to have withdrawals but it would need to be out of your system before it would allow you to feel high off of it again. It was also the same where after about 8mg the affect would top out and it would be a waste to take anymore, so when I would do it recreationally, I could take 30mg if I wanted and not be any more high than if I would take 8-12mg."
1855,"This is completely wrong, bupe tolerance does not build fast. If bupe tolerance went up fast, so would your dosage when on Suboxone.  Bupe is used because you do not have to continue to increase dosage.",Maybe there’s a better thing to call it other than tolerance but the quested asked was how come I can’t get high off bupe after getting high from taking it for consistent days in a row. Well because it builds up in your system fast and then won’t give you a high once you’ve reached that point. Would that not be considered your tolerance going up? I take 8mg a day and have for 4 years. I have also came off it and took it recreationally and got high the first few days then did not anymore after that.

Edit: you'll wanna edit out that part at the end asking for people to dm you, that's sourcing and is pretty against the rules.","Whoa...I have never even heard of CWE. haha. I had no idea that was possible.  I just YouTube how and it looked like I needed a beaker, acetone, boiling pots and the videos are like 30minutes long...made me feel like ""I won't have time to do that or get all of that"".  In your (or anyone's experience) is it worth it?  How hard is it?  Is there an easy way to do it on the fly for someone like me who has yet to try?  Or is there lots of trial and error and takes time/practice to get it right?  

Also..I removed the PM part...thanks man!"

1867,What should I do? Traveling Discussion,"If Tramadol is making you sick, then stay away from it. And there is a seizure risk at higher doses."

1875,What should I do?

May take a few years but once you find a dealer for them your mind will trick you into thinking you can cop just one more time and that’s it once you have a supply and have felt the feeling it’s over man that’s the truth .

There truly isn't much difference between oxy, opana, dilaudid, morphine, even hydrocodone, and heroin. Subtle differences yes but essentially they are all in the big leagues, the same animal, same euphoria and effects (and addiction and withdrawal) all on an equal enough level.

All the best opifam","I'm not up to date on their composition since reformulation. For the most part the biggest concern are particles under 50 microns in size as cigarette filters and cotton is essentially worthless for them. They will build up in your bloodstream (can't dissolve, but get injected and caught in small vessels), and especially places you really don't want them like vessels in your lungs. Yeah, it's fucking weird, but snorting and injecting pills will actually fuck up lungs pretty well over time. With years of it on you, I would really strongly advise doing all you can to stop further damage. It will cost you in yield and filters, not huge, but let's face it most opiate addicts aren't big on waste eh?

There is some additive common in pills that rides the line between soluble and insoluble in water, and idiots that cook their shots manage to push it over the edge into soluble territory, where it promptly precipitates in one's bloodstream. I am drawing a blank right now, but cold shots are highly important with pills especially.

Here is an excellent article explaining exactly how effective common filters are and what loss you can expect with them. It's based on MSContin, but will still apply for your situation. Biggest difference is likely to be whatever the current outer coating is, which I am not up to date on. Sorry. Strongly recommend reading the first few paragraphs at least, along with any sections on filtering methods you are willing to consider.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803777/

Ideally you would crush your pill(s) and cold water extract that, leave the solids. Then cotton/cig filter or equivalent, then wheel filter/micron filter. If you rinse a time or two you are looking at 80-90% yield of the good stuff with virtually no particulate, insoluble or semi soluble.

The cotton/cig filter before micron filter can be skipped and exists more to prevent clogging and thus accidental or frustrated bypassing/other loss.

Those little filters you are talking about, I assume I have had them before from an exchange. They are roughly equivalent to a cig filter in filtering ability but without added risks.

If you were a powder/tar user I wouldn't be stressing this nearly as much. Not if you just occasionally injected pills. Hope you look into this. That literature is useful, I promise. If you want to avoid nasty health complications 5+ years down the road the costs of playing it safe now have to be paid.


Microcrystalline cellulose isn't water soluble technically. In a basic/caustic and hot solution it does edge into soluble territory. Shouldn't be a significant issue, but with basic enough water in a boiled shot a small amount (small) is going to dissolve and crash out in the blood."

Much Love","No problem friend. Not much to do when it comes to vascular damage unfortunately. That plaque build up will be in part from naturally occurring stuff like ""bad"" cholesterol and whatnot, but be compounded with those particulates introduced. It hardens veinous tissue and kills elasticity. It creates blockages. The best thing you can do is limit further damage, and as odd as it is, mind your diet when it comes to cardiovascular health. If you get on top of it now hopefully it never results in some unfortunate bullshit like pulmanary embolism, stroke, or other nasty event. Not saying it will happen if you don't. Just that the odds really swing in the wrong direction.

I can't believe I am telling someone to mind their diet for cardiovascular health. I do a shit job on that myself.

&#x200B;

Cheers","Autoclaves... Only way I imagine one gets access to one of those easily is being in good with an OR nurse or tech. Anyone who sterilizes medical equivalent on a regular basis. Maybe a surgical vet place if you know someone. I'm not sure where else to look. You can definitely buy one, but not exactly cheap. Amazon and especially Alibaba have them. Possibly eBay. Probably 500 entry though.

Ovens get hot enough on cleaning cycle, 800+, to near instantly sterilize technically. With a convection fan system it would *probably* work in a second or two. That involves breaking the locking mechanism and is a fire risk (so you can open during it). Might have done that to turn an oven into a pizza oven... Not sure if the plastic will appreciate more than a flash or two either. Also not a moist heat. It would work, but it's sketchy for not health related reasons and if you are renting there will be displeasure.

Those filters are still going to clog eventually. Not nearly as fast with 2 stage filtering, but how many uses if you sterilize I just don't know. You can disinfect, not truly sterilize, with isopropyl or boiling water. The issues with isopropyl, and more so boiling water, is the rapid regrowth of bacteria. Say you kill 1,000,000,000 out of 1,000,000,002 bacteria with isopropyl. Given a 24 hour period you are back to thousands of bacteria. Used as soon as it is fully dry, the probability you are going to be fine is good, just not 100% ya know? Even enough dead bacteria can become an issue over time too, granted it takes a lot. A not great example, but it gives the picture, say you lost a Tupperware of food in the fridge for a few months. It's gross, bacteria have colonized it thoroughly. You throw it in an oven and take it up to the 600F range. Ignore that some is burned. The inside is sterile, but it's still gross and may likely make you sick. You won't get salmonella or whatever it was poisoning, but those toxic byproducts in their corpses are still there.

Point is that non live bacteria isn't entirely washing off in a iso bath when it can hide in filter pores. An oral syringe? Fine for many washes, but those tiny pores less so. 

An autoclave is just pressurized steam, so maybe a pressure cooker rigged up with some creativity is doable. Probably would take distilled water and a stainless steel rack, but if you can keep the plastic from melting it would do the same thing. Distilled because while other water will become safe through use in the process, it does have minerals etc that may build up on that filter quick due to surface are and clog and harden it. Fast enough to matter? No idea. 

Really spitballing there. I never reused them, but I had them in bulk cheap. I know some have to drop 2-3 bucks a pop which is not great. I would rig a pressure cooker into an autoclave, but only after testing how many times you can get before one clogs or tears. Is it worth the effort?

The syringe should be fine with an iso wash, but clean it after use, and then again hit it with iso before use ideally. It's not technically staying sterilized unless you can close off it's eviroment after by vacuum sealing. In theory anyway. Not sure how many would actually bother with that, but iso is near free and evaporates quick. It's how I handled my tar drip syringe when I went intranasal over IV.

Not super helpful, but maybe you can get an extra use or two out of those filters. Regardless if you find a way to sterilize I don't think they should be reused too many times. They are eventually going to clog or rip on a microscopic level I imagine. I don't have any idea where to draw that line and no literature. If you make it safe from biological hazards it is still better than no micron filter as long as it doesn't break mid use.

Sorry for the ramble, I just don't have much literature I can access on this. Bluelight is the place to try for someone who does. They had an opiate, IV, and pill subforums and some PHD packing regulars back in the day at least with dozens of threads on proper technique. Just can't recall much on reuse of micron filters."

Because of the poor venous circulation, the skin below the level of the injection sites will always be prone to breakdown and in the event of injury, even small injuries, healing time will be greatly delayed (compare poorly controlled diabetics).

(And this remains true even if they swapped to eg groin injecting or abstinence many years ago.) 

Because of the poor venous circulation, the skin below the level of the injection sites will always be prone to breakdown and in the event of injury, even small injuries, healing time will be greatly delayed (compare poorly controlled diabetics).

But I don't think it's nearly such a big deal with arms/hands as it is with legs/feet, where the complications are much more serious.","This comment is pretty much exactly what I was going to say..   i've had veins heal but its also because i stopped IVing.  OP the reason legs/feet are more dangerous is because its harder for your heart to circulate those areas making them more prone to infection as well.    Bottom line is: theres no safe way to constantly poke holes in your veins, you can only minimize damage."

2056,Long term issues from collapsed veins?,I blew out a shitload of veins when I was using. The one good thing I will tell you is that you'll start to grow corollary veins within a few months. You'll end up with new veins that grew out of necessity to help blood flow.
2057,Long term issues from collapsed veins?,My hands fall asleep really easily now too.
2058,Long term issues from collapsed veins?,Sometimes my leg of arms will fall asleep when I’m sleeping if I lay on them. I think it because I killed some veins.

I was lucky that when I ended up in emergency with asthma, I had a specialist down to see me within an hour, he used a portable ultrasound to get a vein. Regular blood tests though, they’ll just jab you 3 times and tell you to come back tomorrow.  A friend had an operation in a not so great hospital. They couldn’t get a vein, so they gave her gas to knock her out while they got one. She woke up after the operation, with a cannula in her knee. Her knee was 3 times the size.

2067,Long term issues from collapsed veins?,Your body will form new veins to make up for the ones you lost. Probably not anything you can shoot in though. I blew out the veins in my hands then one day I had a bunch of new ones. Really cool. Some useable but most were too small.
2068,Long term issues from collapsed veins?,My veins have been blown out for about 10 years. I cant even hit my jugular anymore. Ive been on methadone for 6 months.

2069,Long term issues from collapsed veins?,"I collapsed every surface vein years ago. No problems until recently. My right foot began to get cold at night, now it's mostly all the time. Dr says it isn't bloodflow, because pulse there is normal. But what else could it be?

Yeah new veins grow but as you age, circulation gets worse so problems start. And getting blood drawn is a bitch. I've been squeezing a stress ball trying to revitalise arm veins."
2070,Long term issues from collapsed veins?,"Hey /u/OpiatedMinds! I haven’t posted on this sub in a very long time and glad to see you’re still kicking. 

Anyway back to the topic. My hands and wrists veins had accumulated scar tissue from years of IV use. Like you mentioned, my hands would fall asleep in no time if I ended up nodding out on my arms or dangling to the side. But I’ve cut back a lot since jumping back on methadone and lost connects (5-8+ shots/day to 0-4/month). I think my veins had the chance to repair since I find myself having little to no problems registering a hit and doesn’t fall asleep or get cold as fast as before.

A few years back, this one friend of mine caught my attention with how swollen his hands were for a guy who works out (was a heavy IV user but switched to smoking BTH due to no good veins). Not to be mean but it reminded me of Mickey Mouse hands lol. I’ve seen it mentioned in some articles as “puffy hand syndrome”.

2117,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,Would this method work as good with subs as methadone?
2118,What’s a high off Tramadol like?,People either love tram or hate it. You either convert it good or bad. Don’t exceed 200mg because that’s when it starts lowering your seizure threshold. Start with 100
2119,People either love tram or hate it. You either convert it good or bad. Don’t exceed 200mg because that’s when it starts lowering your seizure threshold. Start with 100,400mg is the limit.
2120,What’s a high off Tramadol like?,take 100 mg and then in an hr take another 100mg. when the second 100 mg hits it's a pure euphoric nod just don't be in public you should be with friends. i do heroin and not pills but i would still do tramadol.
2121,So are different brand oxy 30s different in anyway? Like m30s compared to a215 or k9s . Legally it should all be the same strength but I feel like I have favorites (k9s) is this in my head and it’s the same stuff or is there some info behind this? But what are your favorite ?,"Its in your head man. Theyre all the same, all oxy (unless theyre pressed of course)

Edit: my fav are the mboxes just bc of the nostalgia i have. They were my first oxy 30s"

Legally it should all be the same strength but I feel like I have favorites (k9s) is this in my head and it’s the same stuff or is there some info behind this? But what are your favorite ?,FDA regulation says for any medicine it can have +- 10% of the advertised dose so some brands might have more or less but it’s pretty negligible. Usually the size of the pill is what matters most to people because they don’t want to snort a bunch of powder like in the RP30s

For some reason I felt like these smoked the best but in reality all of them smoked pretty damn well back then.... lol"
2124,RP 15. Do they actually suck or am I just convincing myself that cuz they are different?,I didnt mind them back when I was on my daily habit like 3 or 4 years ago but it sucks to snort if you do.  Such an ass ton of powder you are better of chomping that fucker down.
2125,RP 15. Do they actually suck or am I just convincing myself that cuz they are different?,"They work fine for me, and I have never seen or heard of a pressed one (although I don’t doubt they exist) but I have noticed a lingering headache when I get a batch of them."
2126,RP 15. Do they actually suck or am I just convincing myself that cuz they are different?,"IMO, they suck. Sorry."
2127,"IMO, they suck. Sorry.",Yeah eating them was 100% better but still garbage . I don’t understand how something with the same ingredients can be so much different ? Must have a weird filler in it or something .
2128,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,Wait about 12 hours after the last tram dose I'd assume
2129,Wait about 12 hours after the last tram dose I'd assume,Ok thank you.
2130,Ok thank you.,The longer you wait the better 12-18 hours seems like enough though
2131,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,The fuck? This is medicine and they decided to close shop early? How early/what time did you get there?
2132,The fuck? This is medicine and they decided to close shop early? How early/what time did you get there?,"Yeah. It’s a new chemist (drug store) closer to my home. As I was going into town each day for my dose. But that was a mission so my rehab found a closer place to my house. 

I started going there on Friday. The staff said they are open until 7pm every day. Then yesterday the manager said they’ll be closing Monday so she’ll give me my dose. She said she was also thinking of closing early Sunday as Monday is public holiday here and she’ll give me a take home for then. 

But I arrived and apparently they went home around 6pm. Shop next to them said so. I dose late in the day. So this has left me in the shit. Lucky a home call dr wrote me a small one off script for tramadol to last the next 2 days. But this means I’ve relapsed. I would’ve been ok if she called and told me to come in. But maybe because I’m new there she forgot about me. Sucks"

I would only use the tramadol if you truely, TRUELY feel dope sick. Maybe Monday morning then hold out and get to the chemist early.

If possible change your dose times too."

Ah I was super sick by 8pm our time which was over 24hrs since my sub dose. I got a home doctor visit and he gave me a prescription for a small amount to just lesson the withdrawals over two days. Tomorrow is the public holiday so I’d be going a couple days from my withdrawals. 

I’ve only been on suboxone for 1 month so having to use tramadol isn’t too depressing. If I had been on the program for a while I would’ve been pretty upset taking them. I’ll just have to talk to this new chemist to make sure this doesn’t happen again. I’ll be doing take home dosage soon anyways. But yeah. I have dealt with 3 months of on and off chaotic usage and withdrawals and was so not prepared to go a couple days when I’ve put a lot of effort into rehab and suboxone stabilising."

It sounds like you did everything possible in your power to avoid a situation like this. Unfortunately things outside your control will always happen. While the tramadol may in fact be your substance of choice, you aren't necessarily using it in an abusive manner, or as some would say in true relapse fashion lol. You are simply taking it to prevent withdrawal, just like your Suboxone. Although your rehab may definitely see this as a technical infraction, with full transparency of everything you have described to us, I believe your rehab will understand and not make too big a deal of it. If they do, in your heart you know you didn't relapse. Keep up the good work and props for not using this as a reason to say fuck it and burn it down. ✌️"

I was feeling a bit depressed about it at first. But I’m ok with it now. I have rehab psychologist tomorrow. But they’re super understanding and I did call one member of my rehab the night I couldn’t get my dose (they have one member stationed at the local hospital most nights. But they cannot subscribe anything. Just advice or help with WD symptoms) who said try and see if a doctor can help out for the two days because I’ve been following all the right steps and no need to put myself through WDs if it’s 2 days. Just to not go overboard and I need to make sure I speak with the chemist to make sure this doesn’t happen again just so I don’t have the needless stress of a dumb situation. 

Thanks for the kind words tho mate. Cheered me up"
2137,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,"No. You'll be fine. 

As long as there is a bit of sub in your system still, you will not be at risk for precipitated withdrawal 

Also, tramadol is atypical in its opi effects, and can be taken concurrently with subs"
2138,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,yes. you can dose your sub as you normally would. two days isn’t a long enough time period for all of the bupe to be removed from your receptors. as long as there is bupe still in your system you’ll avoid any pwds that could possibly occurre otherwise. unless you’re a freak of nature.
2139,When will people learn?,Stupidity + desperation = easy target
2140,When will people learn?,"Yeah, for real. Maybe i should get into the business, lol, they only do it because it works.

People who prey on the vulnerabilities of desperate addicts in withdrawal can get fucked."

2144,When will people learn?,I got some too. The same ole excuse. Msg me on Wickr
2145,When will people learn?,"I don't even think they need to do much once a picture is posted...every time I've posted something I would get a dozen pms asking where I got said benzos or if I sell. People literally come to you, the scammer doesn't even need to post something probably against community guidelines or look for potential clients to scam."

2147,When will people learn?,I almost fell for it as I have legit pain and get desperate. Then i realized quickly these scammers are too in your face.

2150,When will people learn?,Cmon guys this is why this sub is going to get shut down because fucking idiots keep sourcing when they are not supposed to. I know people get desperate and sick but stop trying to buy drugs off reddit. you really can’t be that fucking stupid.
2151,When will people learn?,This has only happened to me once though my account isn't even a year old yet. Had some rando message me asking if I wanted to buy L benzos or adderall. Hard pass on that.
2152,When will people learn?,I've said this before but unless you can meet the person in person then it's not worth it. That's the only time I've had things work out. I've never sent money over Reddit though
2153,When will people learn?,ive had multiple people message me about having x for sale and like i had to tell this one guy multiple times i dont do transactions over the internet unless its via DNMs. this shit is ridiculous.
2154,When will people learn?,"If they approach you on reddit to sell you drugs, THEY ARE A SCAMMER. So it's that simple. It's against the rules for a reason."
2155,When will people learn?,anyone who falls for this kind of thing deserves to lose all of their cash and end up in withdrawals.  just unbelievable how much idiocy is on this reddit.
2156,When will people learn?,Its easy to tell a scam though...a drug dealer who wont accept cash is a huge red flag for me.
2157,When will people learn?,It’s tough because not all of them are scammers either.
2158,When will people learn?,Now what to buy with all these gift cards...
2159,I finally got my hands on some kratom after day 3 of WD. I also have some zanaflex. Should I mix them?,If you’re on the third day a 4-5 gram dose of kratom should be plenty.  Inbox me if you have any other questions.
2160,I finally got my hands on some kratom after day 3 of WD. I also have some zanaflex. Should I mix them?,"2mg zanaflex tablets are rather large for such a small amount of active compound, so snorting tablets doesn't seem like an efficient method of delivery. Although a nasal spray is in trials and does have higher bioavailability due to the bypass of first pass metabolism, it requires pH buffers and absorption enhancers. But back to your question, I'm assuming that you chose a red strain of Keaton as your intended use is to control WDs. Zanaflex however administered, will likely add to the sedative effects of a red vein kratom but not much else. I have not tried this combination, but I have mixed kratom with baclofen, benzos and phenibut, and found them to compliment each other nicely. For me, 7g kratom with 1mg Klonopin hits the sweet spot. If your goal is simply to potentiate the effects of your kratom, you should first consider mixing it with grapefruit juice adding about a tablespoon of turmeric and a large pinch of black pepper. Ginger is also an effective enhancer and will help within a nausea you may experience from the kratom. These are much cheaper and more available options then the zanaflex you're attempting to use. If you insist on trying your zanaflex and kratom combination, I would at least add the ginger turmeric and black pepper mixture to control the stomach pain you will inevitably experience. Best of luck"

2162,I finally got my hands on some kratom after day 3 of WD. I also have some zanaflex. Should I mix them?,"A magnesium supplement would also be of benefit. Personally I recommend magnesium gluconate however magnesium citrate is more readily available and much more affordable. Natural calm is a blend of magnesium citrate and citric acid that you can get at most health food stores or Amazon. I would be careful with magnesium supplements if you're prone to diarrhea, however as kratom can cause constipation it might be of benefit to you"

Literally anywhere it says r/opiates then in the same search bar at the top of the page that says r/opiates within the search bar skip one space and type your search. In this case I put daily apap limit. I got about 20 posts that popped up.

I personally would not think that was a huge deal, probably just your anxiety fuxking with you. 7.5 mg of Vicodin is a very low dose of opiate and shouldn't cause any serious respiration problems unless you have a preexisting condition.

And as fall of a tolerance after using Vicodin 2 times over the span of a week or more, again this is just my opinion, but no you shouldn't have developed a tolerance that quick. One rule of thumb for opiates is that nothing is ever like the first time. I have spent 12 years chasing and trying to achieve the way I felt the first time I got high but its just not achievable. 

Also with a low dose like you have taken several things could change the effects such as how much you have eaten each time and other little variables that can cause you to feel more or less high"

2319,Help?,"I have a naturally low heart rate of 50-55 resting.

When I take opiates it can drop down to 35-40...when I first found out, I set off the bradycardia alarm in the ER and 2 nurses ran in looking panicked. I have to explain it any time I'm getting painkillers in the hospital ahead of time so they don't try and cut me off.

Took a while to get used to the feeling of it being so low on opiates, but I've never had any problems. (Besides anxiety)

2361,How many days can you take subs with out feeling wds from them when you stop?,I don’t understand your question if your an active addict and you switch to subs you will withdrawal if you stop taking them just as you would on heroin. If you aren’t a junkie there’s really no reason to take subs more than once in a while for a high that just makes you want regular opiates anyway. But if you’ve already been taking them anywhere from a few days to a week +  of taking them everyday will you begin to feel withdrawal. The thing about it is it’s hard to gauge if your withdrawing from something if your not already knee deep in an addiction. I didn’t think I had any withdrawals at all the first few months of doing tons of perks everyday most days it was almost a year before I could recognize I was in clear cut withdrawal. Times before that I’d feel funky or lethargic but I wouldn’t attribute it to withdrawal but looking back i know now it was the beginning  of wds

Have you looked into Kratom at all though?

1) id need to start w 7gram doses 3x per day and taper down 1 gram per dose per week likely.  Kratom powder can sludge up your liver and go tract at that much.  But it’s totally doable and I believe I can be successful there
2) more importantly, the way Kratom binds to and saturates opioid receptors, ibogaine doesn’t have 95% success rate as it does with traditional, whort acting opioids like oxycodone, heroin, morphine.  I’m 100% committed to my I Ogaden plan, pre and post treatment for coaching, integration and long term abstinence.  I plan to implement Victoria after ibogaine sets me free and repairs the opioid receptors and the brain damage I’ve caused to my natural serotonin firings.  

So that being said i can go on Kratom, large doses, and likely still have to deal with a min level of wd, and then switch back to oxy 2-3 weeks before ibogaine treatment and healing

Or

I can just taper my current supply of oxy blues, change from snorting to oral, get down to 45-60 mg per day “coasting dose” then kick and heal completely with ibogaine.  

Or yet so the same above but after I taper to 45-60 jump on kadian for a few weeks until ibogaine.  Leaning toward this option.  

I have to remain fully functional and top of my game the next 3 months to get my businesses crushing before I leave for Mexico for 3 weeks:  I’m willing to put in the work.  I just know myself by now and what will likely works best is the taper/kadian/ibogaine.

Anyone have success or experience with these options?’

Forcing your self to exercise in some way walk as much as you can and as fast as you can , remember if there was a bag at the end of the walk you would run!

Anything that takes your mine of it.. films , computer games and the like , its all about passing time each film is an hour and a half closer to felling better..

* Nicotine (important)

So Loperamide by itself will help with WDs immensely if you take enough. No, it will **not** cause your heart to flip upside down and start to die. Not in the amounts I take. I take 20, 2mg pills and wait 2 hours then take 10 more if I need it. It takes 2 hours to work so wait it out.

Trazodone is pretty decent at getting you to sleep if you're taking lope too. By itself, it will put you to sleep if your WDs are mild, but if in full blown Opana or Heroin wd, traz wont be enough.

Klonopin/Benzos are a godsend. Basically, life is worth living again with benzos alone but mixed with lope, its a sure thing.

Food/Drink and Nicotine - Basically, after you eat a lot of food you tend to get sleepy and when in WD, sleep is hard to come by. If I'm allowed to sleep whenever I want throughout the day (like on the weekend) the second I feel remotely sleepy, I go to bed. 

I can increase the success rate for this by timing my eating and drinking along with any form of nicotine. So say, I'll force down some ice cream or pasta or any heavy carb meal and then when I start to get that sedated feeling 30-40 mins after eating, I'll smoke or vape heavily and within 5 or 10 mins I'm ready to try to sleep.

Even with benzos I've been in withdrawal so bad that I still can't sleep and aren't willing to take 3-5mg of xanax with no tolerance just to try to sleep. That always scared me.

I don't always have benzos but usually have trazodone and lope and between them and some well timed meals and some ahem, *personal* time, I can usually squeeze out a couple hours sleep  throughout the day if I'm lucky.

If I take much larger doses of lope like 30+ 2mg pills at a time my success rate goes way up but that much lope feels dirty af.

I know this is sort of a shoddy process with a lot of goofy combos. You don't need trazodone if you have benzos for instance."
2403,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"It will help, but if you are on heroin or oxy, what you need is a few days worth  -- 3 to 5 days -- of methadone at a dose that makes you feel normal.  You can bypass or at least seriously reduce acute withdrawal symptoms that way."
2404,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,Help
2405,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"Benzos are what gets me though. I couldn’t have switched from methadone to Suboxone without them.

Magnesium and other supplements are good. Magnesium helps with muscle aches and cramps. Eating well, drinking lots of water. If you’ve got diarrhoea or vomiting, or you’re not eating much at all, Gatorade/electrolyte drinks help.

Try to keep yourself busy, even if it’s just having something good to binge on Netflix. Have everything done so you don’t need to worry about shopping, washing, or errands.

Keeping a diary is good. Score yourself /10 for mood, muscle ache, cramps, vomiting/diarrhoea, anxiety, etc... that way you’ll see that you’re getting better over time. Also keep track of medication, food, and water.

I like guided meditations. I find it’s easier to sleep with them. I’ll link one in.

If you have a spare room, you should use that to detox. I think they say that because you don’t want to associate your bedroom and bed with being sick.

Edit: https://youtu.be/ZAJFk0RQ0J0 search ‘guided mediation and sleep’ in YouTube, it took me awhile to find voices I liked. Goodluck!"

2407,You're the best thank you. I took 10 mg about 10 minutes ago or so already feel much better. I'm on day two of wd and it feels like it will never end,"It’s awful isn’t it. Do you have enough valium to get you through the next few days? I made sure u had a decent stash of valium and Xanax. The worst was I had to go into my clinic each day. I’d feel a bit better as the Suboxone was wearing off, and the underlying methadone took hold, ...but then I’d dose at the clinic and be thrown back into withdrawals. I would have quit if I didn’t need to be on Suboxone to travel.

Here’s the form the doctors use to gauge withdrawal. It’s only physical symptoms though. I felt more in control keeping track, but not everyone would.

2425,Tips on potentiating snorting oxy?,You can’t boost bioavailability of snorting as it bypasses the liver entirely and goes directly into your bloodstream. White grapefruit juice might make the half life longer though as your liver enzymes are impaired by it and will not be able to filter the oxy out of your blood as efficiently as normal. You could also try taking 50 mg of Benadryl (DPH) as it will allow you to nod much easier and reduce a lot of the itchiness oxy comes with.

2439,"Well how can I get a script for pain meds? I have scoliosis, wore a brace as a child if that helps","Just do a search in this subreddit. I come across pretty detailed and accurate instructions on here daily.
Just be prepared to start out with non-opiates and physical therapy and gradually (hopefully) working your way up to low-grade opiates etc etc .
And never EVER ask for anything specific, they’ll see directly through that and label you as a drug seeker and terminate everything. 
Also, a pain management referral is what you will eventually want/need in order to get any kind of monthly prescription. And ‘if’ you’re lucky enough to eventually get some kind of script, you will be subjected to drug tests and pill counts to make sure you’re not abusing your script and / or mixing it with other drugs. If you fail one of those you’ll also be booted.
Good Luck"

When I was first dabbling in opioids I really liked the chill, relaxing qualities. I thought to myself, “how could something so soft be as dangerous as I’ve been told.”

I just assumed these people had weak willpower. I had zero concept of physical withdrawals. I wrongfully assumed the decision to use opioids or not was as simple as choosing tea or juice with breakfast. 

I’ve been off for about 40 days now. After 20 years of destructive behavior and habits. I’ve been off before, once i was clean for 13 months, I relapsed. Another time I was clean for three years, I slipped right back in. It’s a lifelong struggle. 

I really do wish I could go back.

2478,Just a writer trying to make a character more real! Mind if I ask some questions?,"I have never used heroin, but there are some things I could tell you about opium. The smell oh, HELL, when smoked I sense it as sweet meat, never had sweet sausages but I'd imagine them to taste like that, and that taste, after a long night of smoking, lingers for the entire day after. The substance itself smells more like weeds, like cut grass almost with the smallest hint of sweet and tastes extremely bitter. A problem I often have is opium fingers, yeah, like cheeto fingers but way more expensive, opium is usually very brittle so cutting pieces off produce a lot of crumbs, the other presentation is like a sticky gum, similar to hashish if you have handled it, either way, it's not the easiest thing to work with, so sometimes I endup with opium smelling, sticky fingers.

You’re right when you say that there’s too much context to fully explain it, but I can offer you some hammerin’! 

He’s a heroin addict because the opportunity to be one fell in his lap. Kinda the theory that you can’t sell dope if you don’t know the quality of what you’re selling.

You’re right when you say that there’s too much context to fully explain it, but I can offer you some hammerin’!

I’m not trying to make this sexy or appealing, and I’m definitely trying to make it as accurate as I can.","Remember that back then, heroin was commonly bought (legally) as a liquid. A victorian Heroin user would not have been using a spoon to cook up, they would have been using their mail order syringe kit to inject the gear.

And back then Heroin use was not very common.  It was a novel drug - Morphine was the big ""epidemic"" at the time.  I'd consider making your character a Morphine addict, but I guess it doesn't have the same ""Shock"" value as H does.

Opium in the victorian era was legally available and I'd say the vast majority of opiate addicts used plain Opium.

Read Thomas de Quincey's book - he would buy opium at his local pharmacy (he'd walk in and the pharmacist would give him ""the usual"")  and he would take it orally.  Later he got hooked on laudanum (opium tincture).

Also, if your main character doesn't have access to a steady supply, if he has any kind of habit, the book will just be about your main character hustling to try to get dope."

You need to set up a reason for his addiction. I don’t know one addict that hasn’t had trauma in their past.  Everyone has a sad story. Though there would be people just using it for pain management, I just haven’t met any.

Heroin, benzos, and other depressants give a certain numbness. I’m coming down off Suboxone at the moment, and I’d forgetten how bad it was to feel everything. Anxiety, sadness, depression, as well as physical pain. It’s awful.

2488,"Not looking to alter, nor criticize your decision to include a heroin addict as what must be a rather important character in your book, only curious as to why you chose heroin as opposed to another drug? 

I understand if there's a bit too much context or whatever to completely nail the answer to my question down, but a little bit of hammerin' would be appreciated.

As far as your questions, I don't have much time, so I'll just say this: Most books, movies, shows, etc. that I've read or seen tend to portray heroin/opioid use and abuse in ab unrealistic manner to say the least, obviously some moreso than others. Think of examples you yourself are familiar with and it's probably safe to assume that you don't want to do it like they did. 

As for quality examples from fiction, Borroughs is great and Trainspotting is fairly accurate. Not heroin-centric, but A Scanner Darkly is a wonderful depiction of many aspects of addiction.

As for myself and my own drug use? Heroin is poop and I wish I'd never heard of it, the poopy poop.",Maybe the heroin/opium just works for his neo Victorian character cuz opium was so popular back then but I kinda wanna know too??

The era the OP has chosen and the creation of the first syringes were around the same time. And I'm guessing that only medical personnel would be inclined to 'mess' around with opium to convert it in to something that can be IVe'd? Or I could be totally wrong and should be ignored, lol."

With heroin you can just do a “miss”, which would still get the drugs in your system but that’s not enough for some... it’s the blood lust to get that one certain vein and (as I watched my ex do so many times...) they will dig and dig until finding that vein.

2501,What causes withdrawal symptoms to change over time?,"My w/d's change depending on what I'm kicking. Oxy, opana, heroin, fent all have very different symptoms. I mean they all consist of the same basic symptoms but they hit at different times if that makes sense. Like opana and fent would have me in near panic attack mode due to my anxiety in under 12 hours where that hits in about 36 hours with heroin. My stomach would be fucked up around 18 to 24 off oxy and can normally make it 48 til its really bad off heroin. Also it varies depending on if I'm shooting or snorting or smoking and how long I have been using for this time and how much I'm using daily. So many variables."

2512,how strong is oxy compared to hydros?,"1.5:1  exactly  , even with oral  bioavailability  taken into  account  thats an accurate  ratio.
So 30 mg of hydro = 20mg of oxy 
But its a different type  opioid   as its main alkaloid  is different  its far less sedating  and a lot more euphoric.  Id say start with 10-15 mg of oxy and add 5 mg every 45 mins till you reach  desired  result. Be careful  with it but oxy is still a relatively  weak opiod.
Just be carefully  of pressed  pills oxy is the most counterfeited pill out there so always  test ur oxy for fentanyl  if its not from the pharmacy, even if you trust your source, ur fuckin up already because **rule #1 is trust nobody** they may not even know  themselves. Anyways be safe  and enjoy oxy is probably  the most fun enjoyable opiate out there.

It would be a great contribution to the world. I've had just about enough of this ""war on drugs"". Opiates are technically some of the safest drugs there are. As long as you don't mix them with obscene amounts of other downers with little to no tolerance, they really are pretty benign. They cause no permanent brain or organ damage and the side effects are pretty minimal.  Society is ignorant and uneducated about any of it, they just blatantly believe what they're told. Not everyone can remain ""clean"" and when you think about how drugs like alcohol are legal, why should they? Alcohol is the worst drug there is, in my opinion. It damages the brain, your organs, leads to domestic violence and traffic accidents, yet it's celebrated like it's something great.   


People should have the right to wake up and take whatever helps them get through their day without blowing their brains or some one else's out. The fact that America incarcerates potheads and opiate addicts, while letting bars flourish everywhere, where drunks can get completely retarded and then drive home and kill another innocent family just boils my blood!  Getting a little off topic here, but I feel it's all relevant and it's an area I'm very passionate about. I wish I wasn't just another ordinary citizen and had some power to get things changed.

yes, well off and living comfortably enough that i recently turned down an opportunity to get back in the game with basically everything already setup and all the hard work done for me. it was a turn-key opportunity to make anywhere from $5k-$6k per month with plugs who had cheap but quality product already established as well as a large customer-base.

to explain what i mean by that: one of my best friends, also a fellow Reddit user, started dealing about 2 years ago and he was BRAND NEW to the game when it came to dealing. i helped him a lot at the beginning with plugs and sent him some customers that ended up being really lucrative who paid top dollar retail prices for large amounts on a consistent basis. he eventually over the next 2 years and some ups and downs ended up building this into a very successful operation that was pulling in approximately $10k-$12k per month in profits. he kept records of all his sales and P&Ls on an Excel spreadsheet, so i saw the exact revenue he was generating from this operation.

side note: he also paid me a commission for the customers i sent him, approximately $500 cash in total as well as some really nice gifts like designer clothes (Versace, Diesel, etc) and free drugs including 10 subs and an entire piece (ounce) of tar at once, 100% free (that was a good night lol)

he contacted me one day and said he wanted to setup a meeting, so i went and met him a his hotel room and he sat me down for a literal presentation on Powerpoint (lmao) showing me all the current and projected profits along with plans for expansion, etc and told me that he wanted me to join him in business and come take what was rightfully mine (aka half of the business & profits). he guaranteed me $1k/week minimum or half of the profits, whichever was bigger, and at that current time he was bringing in appoximately $10k-$12k in profits per month which translates to $5k-$6k per month in profit for me.

at that time, and still currently, i was working a sales job and making just a little under that (approx $4k/month after taxes) and while it was very tempting to say ""fuck a job"" and join him, after careful consideration i declined his offer because it wasn't worth the risk plus nothing is guaranteed when it comes to the game. one small mistake or change and everything could fall apart, or worse. and it's a good thing i made that choice, because he has been in jail for a couple of months now for Felony Evading Police as well as some probation violations and he will be there for a couple more months. another part of the reason i declined is because when i was in the game, i was very very careful and took every caution possible to stay safe and he was the exact opposite, very ""loud"" and sloppy and i knew there would not only be issues between us in how things were run but i knew it was only a matter of time before something bad happened.

A lot of people think that $5-$6k a month is insane money, and I guess for some people it is, but if you get a sales charge on an operation that big, you’re going away for a long time. 

Shit, with a minimum wage job around here, you can make half of that easy, and not risk going to prison. Find a job that pays good tips and you can make even more. 

I guess what I’m saying is, as someone who has been to jail for several months, it would take a lot more than 60k a year for me to risk that again."

And you're absolutely right. What made it even easier to turn down is that somehow, by the grace of the Universe, I have avoided ever catching a charge throughout all my years of using, selling, etc which is literally a miracle considering I have done some really grimey shit in and have ran lots of hustles in the past. I've also gotten SUPER close to getting hemmed up on multiple occasions but somehow always was able to walk between the raindrops. I shared several of my close-call stories on here in the past but recently nuked my comment history so they are all gone.

It made it easy to turn it down when weighing the consequences of potentially risking my clean record and entering the system at 31 years old. I have seen soooo many of my friends struggle with serving jail/prison time, being stuck in the system, difficulties with finding employment and/or a place to live, thousands of dollars in fees and court costs, etc

you are right about the stress, i have sold H in the past on a smaller scale as well and it was extremely stressful. there are so many factors that make it stressful and so many things to worry about from running the business in general, to sketchy customers, potentially being arrested or robbed, having someone OD on your product and it be traced back to you, making sure u don't run out of product and get sick, etc the list goes on and on.

throughout my career as a full-time dealer, i've had several different situations where i had some sort of law enforcement agency up my ass... from the local police, to the DEA, to the FBI (twice) although the FBI weren't really up my ass, they were investigating a close associate of mine both times, one time it probably wasn't that big of a deal but the other time, i'm certain they were watching me to some extent because i was the main supplier for a particular piece of contraband (not drugs) that my friend got caught committing felonies with. i've been on their radar since i was in high school though as well, so it's not that surprising. i remember coming home from a friend's house one day, when i was 17, and my Dad freaked out on me, screaming and yelling at me, because our neighbor told him that they saw an undercover cop across the street by their house sitting in their car, surveilling and taking pictures of our house.

as far as drug-related, one of my customers got caught with a gram of dope on him right after i served him and he was on probation, so they tried to get him to cooperate and perform a couple of controlled buys on me in exchange for sweeping his probation violation under the rug. he randomly hit me up 2 weeks later after i served him that day and told me he just got out of jail and he told what they tried to get him to do. i was honestly surprised cuz this dude wasn't really a close friend or anything, more of an acquaintance that i worked with at one point.

i've also been into hacking and cybercrime since i was a young kid (11 yrs old or so) and have ran a lot of rackets online in the past, and while i have always had pretty good opsec, i know for a fact that my activities did not go unnoticed and that i was probably on a list somewhere at some point. at one point, a server that i was operating from got seized by the Secret Service lol i still have the article somewhere from that one.

the things i've described in the post aren't even half of the times i've suspected that i was under investigation or came really close to getting completely fucked, probably for a very long time lol thankfully i've put all of that in the past and don't have to live looking back over my shoulders constantly...

but yes, my friend was ridiculously ""loud"" and kinda had that ""i'm scarface and untouchable"" type of attitude. he was notoriously sloppy and uncareful when it came to keeping a low-key profile. among the many, many things he did that were careless and irresponsible, one example is that he was almost always driving around, unnecessarily, with a life sentence in his car. i'm talking a bag with 5+ ounces of dope, an ounce of crystal or coke, ounce of molly, scales, bags, paraphernalia like pipes and rigs, large amounts of cash, weapons, etc. the only thing he was missing was a body in the trunk, and, he was on probation so they could search without probable cause. for a while, he wasn't even supposed to be driving cuz he had absconded on probation, so if they pulled him over and ran his name, he was done for. but he would drive around like this, all to deliver a couple grams of dope when he had a perfectly safe home to store all this illegal product at instead of only taking the absolute bare minimum needed so that he wasn't riding dirty. he would also regularly post up in sketchy places like random parking lots at 3am with all of this on him to get high. it stressed me out SO MUCH to hang out with him once he started behaving like this, which he didn't always act like this, only once the power got to his head did he start acting so careless.

so yeah, when he proposed for me to join him, i immediately knew that there was no way i was going to accept because we operated completely different and would have had many differences when it came to how we operated. i valued my freedom and there is a reason that i was able to do it so long without catching a single charge. i took the absolute bare minimum risk and took every precaution possible, always had a plan and then backup plan, and because of that i narrowly avoided getting hemmed up several, several times.

a while back, he told me that two of his runners got setup and picked up by the DEA or drug task force or something of that nature and one of them was a spineless, huge piece of shit who, without a doubt, rolled over and snitched the second they gave him the opportunity to. so he was already probably being watched and investigated and he ended up committing a Felony Evading Police when they tried to pull him over, but there is a no chase policy where i live so they didn't get him that night and he got away but a couple of weeks later the SWAT team rolled up on him at like 5am and arrested him at this house for running that one night, among other things i am sure... and i probably would have went down with him that night as well cuz i'm sure i would have been with him at his house.

damn, i didn't mean to type that much... sorry for the novel lmao"

Getting to know your customers and being a halfway decent human being goes a LONG way for a lot of addicts... if dealers operated under even the most common of senses, i might have an answer for ya haha",A thousand percent True

One night then he hit me up for $40 to go cop some fire from the capital (nearby-ish big-ish city with good dope).  Since I’d done so much business with him and he always came back, and I was giving him $60-100/day in business so the $40 seemed like a drop in the bucket that he’d never be stupid enough to rip me off for considering the scale of our business together.

Welcome to the wild, woolly, and sometimes maybe even warm world of physically dependent heroin addicts. 

Personally I have Ph-fucking-Ds from the junkie equivalent of MIT in rationalization, cognitive dissonance, avoidance, and denial. In other words if my only perceived route to getting well was to get over on you, I’d do it. I wouldn’t be proud of myself or enjoy doing it and I’d always feel guilty afterwards. I knew it was poor business sense if I was trying to middle for people or whatever: But if that’s what it took to be okay, part of me did what I did while part of me insisted I’m still not that guy deep down right? 

So if I did what your dude did and I came up a few days later or whatever I’d seek to make it right too. Exactly as he did, come on really earnest and desperate to make it right. 

I know people make a big deal of their reputations and that they’d never steal or whatever. That’s cool if you’re able to “manage a habit” or you’re on the dealer side of things where trust often matters quite a bit. Frankly when heroin started to cost me everything that made me human (ironically I did it because it made me feel human) I put aside what other people who did heroin thought of me. It wasn’t a disorder or a bad learned behavior or a disease to me, it was a moral failure and a sin. A product of my inability to look the world in the eye. I assumed everyone else was on their trip like mine, which was so far from reality I can’t believe I was so naive. But since I thought that every other heroin user was a spineless tortured oversensitive quasi-suicidal loser like me, I could easily dismiss whatever your opinion became of me. 

“Thief”? Big deal - you were stealing your family’s peace of mind and a parent from your kid and a partner from your spouse and a decent person from society. You were all part of the problem and you loved it. Why should I care about what you thought of me, as long as it didn’t interfere with my other connects?

But if things lined up where I could “do the right thing” and salvage a drug acquaintanceship, sure I’d do it."
2653,Dude who beat me for $40 paid me back...with interest...the fuck?,This actually happened to me once too.

Turns out he burned the plug and got the shit best out of him. Huge black eye and everything. But i guess he felt bad about ripping me off cause he atleast made sure I got what he owed me.

But i guess he felt bad about ripping me off cause he atleast made sure I got what he owed me.,"This is admittedly the first time this has happened to me, normally when a middle rips me they never talk to me again.  It is an interesting subject, though, because when you think about it, who is responsible when the middle gets ripped or fucked up?  Middles always justify charging me more or taking part of the order by saying that they are taking all the risk.  I’m fine paying middles (or providing them part of the order) accordingly.  However, if I’m paying a middle to assume the risk, they should assume the risk of robbery and loss and therefore, if they take a front, pay it back if they don’t deliver my product.

Of course, that is the logical business reasoning behind the distribution of risk and responsibility.  As most middles are junkies themselves, they are often far removed from any sort of logic or reasoning."

Apparently he’s still recovering from whatever loss he took (or whatever reason he robbed me).  That is kind of what I found most impressive, though.

When I was a full blown junkie, of course I did things I’m not proud of.  I robbed tons of stores, stole cash here and there from various outlets/channels, but as I was a junkie myself and knew how much being sick sucked and how hard it was to get the cash I needed everyday, I never fucked over fellow junkies as I would never want to put another person in that situation.

Been here my whole life and it's been like this for about 5 years now.,"I’m kind of in the same boat actually, I’ve just put together some plugs recently, but it was really fucking hard work.  I live in a VERY small town in BFE right now and there is one plug in the whole town who supplies the four or five street level dealers.  The four or five street level dealers sell half and quarter points for $10, but stepped on to all hell (first time I copped here was their shit, I was like 50+ days sober at the time I believe, I did a half gram and still wasn’t high, just not sick and sluggish).

We are somewhat close to the capital, though, where they have fire ECP stamps (ECP stamps that actually taste and smell like dog food).  In said capital, you can get buns for $30-40 as I understand it.  The main plug that provides to the street level guys goes to the capital, cops a few bricks, and brings it back and distributes to the street dudes for them to chop up and sell as they please.

My middle is said big plug’s cousin or brother or some shit.  He’s a junkie, but he is also the one with the actual connect in the capital.  As a result, he gets a free ride to the capital with the main plug and the main plug tosses him a bit each trip.

After each trip, my middle comes back with a few $30-40 buns (a little cheaper as he gets some tossed on for free) and then sells them to me uncut for $10/bag, but doesn’t cut them at all.  I get fire that I can actually get high off of as well as quasi-decent prices (especially for around here at least) and he makes a few shekels off of each bun and gets some bags to blast himself for free.

It’s a perfectly symbiotic relationship except when he decides to fuck me over even when I’m kind enough to front his ass."
2680,"I’m kind of in the same boat actually, I’ve just put together some plugs recently, but it was really fucking hard work.  I live in a VERY small town in BFE right now and there is one plug in the whole town who supplies the four or five street level dealers.  The four or five street level dealers sell half and quarter points for $10, but stepped on to all hell (first time I copped here was their shit, I was like 50+ days sober at the time I believe, I did a half gram and still wasn’t high, just not sick and sluggish).

We are somewhat close to the capital, though, where they have fire ECP stamps (ECP stamps that actually taste and smell like dog food).

2681,Shit atleast you got plugs. I'm semi in the middle of nowhere but in a decent sized city and there's not a goddamm thing here. Closest is an hour away and it's expensive as fuuuuuck. I'm talking $40 for like a point amd a half. Been here my whole life and it's been like this for about 5 years now.,You gotta get with the future and start buying drugs online lol.
2682,Dude who beat me for $40 paid me back...with interest...the fuck?,Y20 blue xanax
2683,Y20 blue xanax,Huh?!?
2684,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"You have to have some landing gear after coke. Oxy, H, Xanax. Whatever. H is great if you're coming down from a binge, need to take the edge off and still be functional. Otherwise it's Xanax for sleep all the way."
2685,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,What do you guys think about wiping your ass after you take a shit? Like bruh seriously is there any other option? Lol just busting your balls. But I won't touch coke or crack without some dope and maybe a Xanax for when I'm done
2686,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"Yeah I always had to do morphine or H after coke or crack. I can’t stand the anxiety associated with the come down. I just wanna nod off and go to bed. Albeit I was never super fond of uppers in general, so it wasn’t a common thing for me. But i’ll never say no to drugs so.."
2687,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"Yes, this is extremely common.  A lot of wealthy professionals like tech and finance folks who get coked out or blast Adderall to work longer and make more often develop Opiate or Benzo addictions in an attempt to find a consistent come down."
2688,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"If I smoke rock without opiates/benzos/both then I’m in for a miserable borderline suicidal night.

If nothing else, clonidine works well and also high dose l-theanine (sublingual) is surprisingly effective at bringing my heart rate down and easing restlessness"
2689,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"Back in the day, at the height of my use I was doing a gram of dope and coke a day, sometimes 2. I would literally lay out 2 equal lines of each, them mix them into one big line, a sniff the whole thing lmao... I would then smoke crack a lil later. Damn I remember how amazing it all was. I'm basically clean now, no dope but the occasional oxy once every couple months."
2690,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"This is a requirement lmao. Although, since I’m a total fiend, requirement means “nice, but if I can’t make it happen still gonna get high and hate my life coming down without black lol.”"
2691,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,I hated coke without opiates to level it off and negate the come down. Literally dysphoric without them for me overall. No idea how people can binge on coke without something else. They are some tough mofos or something.
2692,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,Obv
2693,How much codeine phosphate for first timer?,I’d say 120-150 mg for a good high
2694,How much codeine phosphate for first timer?,"90-120mg. If you dont feel anything dont redose you mignt not metabolise correctly im your liver due to lack of enzymes like me.

You’ll just feel sick"
2695,"90-120mg. If you dont feel anything dont redose you mignt not metabolise correctly im your liver due to lack of enzymes like me.

You’ll just feel sick","That's unfortunate.  Codeine is actually a pretty good high for beginners at the ~150 mg level, provided you can convert 10% of it to morphine.  There are also supermetabolizers who can convert much more, leading to a potential overdose.  OP should proceed with caution and let others know what he/she is doing, just in case."

2698,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,Thankfully the plug ended up agreeing to fronting me two
2699,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"I have chase, and I’ve never been able to overdraw my checking account, unfortunately. 

Ive been in your shoes, and even tried “process as credit” for some cashback at a gas station, to no avail."
2700,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"only way I know of is at the gas pump, so, if someone needs 40.00 in gas, they can give you the cash and you can overdraft as the pumps only look for $1 on whatever card you try to use, not positive about ""Chase"" but every card I have had other than prepaid like Greendot worked this way."
2701,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"Unfortunately I don't think you can with Chase. I used to be able to with Bank of America but not anymore. This is not an immediate solution, but have you tried apps like Earnin'? It takes 1-3 days to process but if you have a job (or other source of income), direct deposit and a bank account (which it seems you have all those) you can get money fronted to you. I just used it for exactly this lol. Worked like a charm."

2705,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,Lol I used to overdraft my chase  account 800 bucks every 2 weeks
2706,Lol I used to overdraft my chase  account 800 bucks every 2 weeks,How would I go about getting just $40 out then?
2707,How would I go about getting just $40 out then?,"Set up debit card coverage. If you have a consistent paycheck theyll let you overdraw about as much as you get in direct deposit in my experience. Its a shitty trap though be warned as i was doing the same exact thing with the same bank youre using and you get caught in this cycle of ""ooh i got paid today! Fuck $400 of it went to overdraft fees"" then you get to the point of ""fuck i aint got enough money to take care of my financial obligations after those overdraft fees were taken out, guess i gotta overdraft it again"" then you are getting to the point where maybe one of your checks isnt as good as usual and it doesnt even let you break even on your account balance, thats where youre trapped because youll just be thinking ""idgaf if i overdraft my account i worked for this damn money and i cant last til my next payday on whatever paltry amount i have now"" trust me man think long and hard about this one because its a killer."
2708,How would I go about getting just $40 out then?,You have a second bank account?
2709,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"There isn’t really a *how* to it. You either can or you can’t. It could depend on the account you have. If you have a free checking acct., or if you have, like, a “plus” checking acct., or any acct. that offers benefits over a standard account. There’s usually a few different types the banks offer when you open your account. Mine, for example, has no overdraft fees and offers up to 1,500 cash advance. If you’re not eligible for a cash advance, the ATM will probably not let you withdrawal money you don’t have in there. You can try getting cash back, but again, depending on what your specific account allows, the transaction can still be denied due to insufficient funds. Good luck. 

An alternative, try requesting in r/borrow

If you’re not familiar with the sub: people request X amount of money, with a promise to pay back X amount plus an interest-like tip, on X date.
(i.e. requesting $40, will pay back $50 on 10/04/19)"

2711,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"If you have overdraft protection you can just buy something at a grocery store or Walmart and get cash back. There’s obvi a fee, but I’ve done it when I’m desperate."
2712,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,[deleted]
2713,[deleted],I tried to do it online in chase’ settings and it said I had no “eligible” overdraft accounts unfortunately.
2714,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"You can deposit a check at an atm with chase and receive up to $100 or $200 of that deposit immediately.  I would write a check from an old account sometimes when I was desperate and deposit it, take the money out immediately from the atm and it would be a full two days before they realized the check bounced.  By the time the check bounced, my direct deposit would hit to cover the overdraft.  Chase didn't care for this type of behavior one bit and cancelled my account the 2nd time I did it."
2715,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,Overdrafting ability is not specific to the bank you use it’s specific to the way your account was set up. When you opened it you either selected or it was pre-selected based on the product whether to allow the bank to process transactions that will result in an overdraft. Often times people will say no bc they don’t want to incur the fees associated if it happens via error or even to prevent it happening with fraud. If you have bad credit the checking product may have it disabled given they aren’t confident you would be able to repay the amount plus fees if they did process it. Unless you have an additional product called an overdraft line of credit then you will not be able to overdraft at an ATM for sure and most likely nowhere unless it runs just the preauthorization amount first before true amount like someone was mentioning with gas stations above. If it is rejecting it then that is a factor of product and account set up. Call the bank and ask for overdraft protection (also called overdraft line of credit some places) if you want to be able to overdraft in the future but realize your credit score will impact if they allow you to have this product.
2716,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,This is what fucked my credit up. I would just take a cash advance out on my credit cards and if end up never paying it back and before I knew it my cards were maxed

2742,Why does heroin give me so much energy?,"Very high quality tar gave me energy too when I was using. In all but super high doses. I had undiagnosed sleep issues though so that may have been part of it.

#3 to a small extent, and tar and opium to a greater extent, tend to have other non diacetylmorphine opiates present with some varying degrees of euphoria to respiratory depression to sedation to stimulation ratios. Tar in particular has high levels of 6-monoacetylmorphine which is the god-king of opiates as far as euphoria to other effects goes giving a stimulating effect. Appreciable in top tier tar no doubt.

Some people just react differently to opiates though. I got energy and euphoria and rarely nodded nor even enjoyed nodding. Others get the sedation and love that going as far as preferring fent and analogues with their low euphoria to respiratory depression and sedation ratios.

I'd say you are a lucky one in your reaction."

Mix it with a certain amount of water, it will mix evenly in water, then you can measure out exact dosages, just make sure your math is right, ask on here if you need a double check.",This seems to be the safest method to accurately measure your dose. I've heard of people making this solution stronger and then putting it in a nasal spray bottle for ease of use and dose control.
2755,Good way to dose fentanyl?,32mg of sub a day? Jesus. I used to sprinkle fent on weed or tobacco and take very small hits. Id usually nod off and pass out after only a couple small puffs. Be very fucking careful.

Addiction is powerful but I believe everyone has the will power to abstain from anything they put their mind too. Stop allowing this word addiction decide the outcome of your life. You can live with addiction or you can let it push you towards your death. I'd just think watching a friend od would be enough for most to quit the nonsense. Ps I miss opiates everyday. Had to get my mom a perc script yesterday and never in the past 5 years did I want to eat a pill more than I did yesterday. I know I'm still addicted but I know my will power is strong.

2800,"Oxycodone and NDRI, any interaction?",One will cancel out the other if the doses aren’t correct. What you’re doing is called a spotted ball. Be careful because the duration of the drugs are different so if you do too much of one it might kill you if you’re not habituated to it at higher doses. Just know that they’ll potentiate each other but at your dose it should be fine to mix Ritalin and Oxy. A friend of mine used to take Adderall and Oxy all the time and said it was one of the greatest pleasures ever. Long story short he has a really hard dependency to kick
2801,"Oxycodone and NDRI, any interaction?","No one has answered: if these drugs are legal medicines, you can call a pharmacy and ask them."
2802,"Oxycodone and NDRI, any interaction?",I am not familiar with the stims you're taking as I have never personally taken them but I love mixing coke or crack and any and all opiates as well as meth and any and all opiates.

2809,I meant why as in more intense? Longer? What’s worse about it not the scientific explanation,All of it. Why do you want to know?
2810,"Which one is worse, heroin WD or oxy WD?","Generally, assuming equivalent relative use between opiates, the longer the half life the worse the withdrawals. Short half life opiates will have somewhat more intense withdrawals in comparison, but last far less time. 

Heroin depends a lot on the actual product you have. Pure diacetylmorphine will have a moderate withdraw period and intensity, while diacetylmorphine cut with just fentanyl (mind you, more analogues change this) will have an intense period of withdrawal early thanks to the fent, and continue into to moderate duration and intensity via the diacetylmorphine.

Something like methadone and bupe have long enough half life's to push withdrawals into the weeks to month+ range. That's just straight up acute withdrawal, not even talking post acute withdrawal depression."

I have noticed a lot of users quit when they FIRST get addicted. I did. I said the same as you -- weed was anxiogenic and I wanted to relax.

Well, as I got older and my addiction went on weed actually started to relieve the stress if my addiction to heroin. It became a great comfort during withdrawal, it allowed me to see my situation from the Birds eye view, and guess what??? From that perspective, a little dope sickness really AINT SHIT. And I can actually enjoy some goddamned music. Now, a lot of dope sickness (ie wd from a really big habit) really is shit, but it STILL isn't THAT bad, and it's still mostly just a bad flu if you keep the proper mentality (and a couple of subs, 10 Valium, and 20 400 mg gabapentin, along with the aforementioned cannabis doesn't hurt either).

Anyways... Bottom line, I do smoke herb again although I tend to smoke less during the worst parts of my addiction. Just smoking a little herb after being abstinent from it for a couple weeks tends to rein my use in, which is always a good thing. N

It makes me think twice about my use. In a good way.

Now, if I smoke TOO much, this self analysis can go too far and produce some anxiety or depression. But, that's just taking too much. Taking too much dope makes me, ya know, FUXKING DIE, so I just don't do that, and too much weed makes me anxious, so I just dont do that."

2859,"Doing the subs, clonazepam, weed diet right now.  Problem is in Canada we still get the white tablet subs with the arrow on the back. And insufflating really helps with bioavailability. Right now I'm on 8mg a day. Was thinking of switching to methadone but would rather not die and no idea what the equivalent dose is. See my sub doctor tomorrow. Shrink next week. I also take lyrics which is great for those i want full agonist cravings. Suboxone does nothing for me when sublingual. I know it's not supposed to get you high but come on give me a little bit of a boost. Maybe I'll roll my way up to 12 mg of subs and that 16.24 and then start tapering back down and then bring Kratom back into the picture start smoking some weed","Honestly, you'll probably get a bigger high from lower doses of sub.

And yes, Lyrica and similar drugs like gabapentin definitely help with cravings. They just also have their own dependence and withdrawal.

An equivalent dosage to 8 mg of subs intranasal (or really any dose above like 4 to 8 sublingual or equivalent in other routes of administration, eg 3 to 6 mg intranasal) would be about 30 mg of methadone. Maybe 40. Subs don't ever really do much more than what 40 mg of methadone does.

Again, increasing your sub dose will not add much if any ""good"" opioid effects. There's a ceiling on it's activity at the mu receptor. Going up will either do nothing or give you a bigger dependence to subs other (sorta weird) effects without making you feel any better."

Ideally, we would all walk the earth in complete homeostasis, every chemical in our brains in balance.   That's not the case because we're all damaged in some way, most drug use or abuse is an attempt to right the ship.

If you tested everyone, even the anti-drug crusaders, you'd find a majority of people have one or more of legal, non-prescription drugs like coffee, alcohol, nicotine, THC, psychotropic drugs (Xanax, SSRIs, etc), high levels of refined sugar, etc.

And the ""clean"" ones are on some other trip, like religion, or they're into pedophilia, they beat their wives and children, or they're just plain nasty people.

Do what you have to do to get by and try not to damage yourself or others.  Besides that, there are no rules.  I smoke weed because my system loves it, I might suggest it for someone with certain medical issues."

I could continue and go on about all the short and long term effects of spice and how i would advocate against whatever chemical happens to be in that batch because most of the potpourris are worse than even heroin. I found that out when i heard of addicts switching to spice because they weren’t suffering from opiate withdrawals as much as it was spice that was giving them terrible withdrawals.
2901,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Can’t think of any funny stories at the moment. But I was definitely the “square” or the “prude” of my group. I stopped smoking around 16/17 after being a heavy smoker for the last 3-4 years. I mean like a smoke tons of weed every day heavy user. For exactly the same reason as you. It made me extremely paranoid with awful anxiety. 

It was actually the group inside joke to ask me if I want to hit the bong whenever it’d go around. I also gave up drinking relatively young. And shortly after partying and all other drugs that weren’t opiates. And of course no one knew/knows I use(d) opiates. I was the tiny shy quiet naive innocent girl who was hopelessly in love with someone who didn’t love her back. (Jokes on him tho bc after waiting for 4 years we finally got together and are now engaged and together going 7 years strong)

Everyone pretty much thought I just got super serious about school but the truth is a really bad mushroom trip ruined all drugs for me. I’ve never been more scared except for the time my ex best friend OD’ed in my living room. After the bad trip I couldn’t be on anything that left me feeling ‘out of control/not completely in control of myself’.

Opiates specifically oxycodone hit that perfect sweet spot. I could get high and also feel super safe calm and in control of myself. I guess it’s usually the ones who appear the most innocent and put together that are really the ones with the darkest secrets."

I think the majority of us smoke pot. We do it because it gets us away from thinking about shit. I don’t mind small amounts of psychedelics now, but it does make you see things much more clearly. I’d prefer psychedelics over pot any day!"

I’m pretty introverted but I’m “cool” with everyone at my job, they are a bit younger, it’s wild to think I just turned 30, but my coworkers always smoke and ask me to join them and I just blame it on probation. I’m a pretty anxious person already and weed makes my anxiety and over analyzing everything go to a ten it’s so uncomfortable. This is common in opiate users I’ve come to find out over the years, people that used to smoke mad weed when they started using opiates, they started to hate weed. When you’re clean it’s even worse lol. Maybe it’s a chemical change in the brain or maybe we expect an opiate like high subconsciously and it’s something not even close. Who knows but I’m with you and I’m sure hundreds of people in this sub are too lol."
2905,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"yeah dude I've never really liked weed because of the anxiety it gives me (but it does improve my perception of music a lot, which is one aspect I appreciate). Before I became a daily dope user, I'd maybe do weed once in a while if I were really bored, but once my drug habit became serious, I would spend all my money on heroin and coke. I knew what kind of high I liked, so why sacrifice a bellringer or two just to get some weed? And now that I'm on methadone, I'm not supposed to test positive for thc if I want take-homes. 

Psychedelics were the first drugs I ever did and I really appreciate my experiences on them, but absolutely none of them were 'fun' or totally enjoyable, barring maybe the time I did DMT (took a xanax beforehand, but also it was so intense an experience, I couldn't get caught up in anxious thoughts-- I was too busy just being strapped in for the ride). 

I had a similar experience to you in college. Definitely was assumed to be a teetotaller because I didn't drink or partake in any visible drug use of any kind (although I would have if I knew more people at my college who used harder drugs). There was an arrogance and also an insecurity/anxiety behind it though. Anyway, that was a few years ago. Managed to hide my dope habit throughout 2 years as a data engineer in silicon valley, until I began speedballing, which made me spectacularly implode in a matter of months."

2919,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Weed's the only way I'm able to eat and keep food down, due to some undiagnosed motility issue. If I don't have any green to calm my nausea and ensure the food moves from my stomach to my bowels, then hours after I eat -- when the stomach should normally already be empty again -- I'll vomit back up _everything_ I'd eaten since the last time I threw up. In the past I've lost up to 30lbs in a few weeks and become grossly dehydrated and malnourished, to the point that my skin was flaking off and my hair was falling out. 
But yeah, in the end I'm just thankful that you guys _have_ and can take the option to not smoke weed. 

Granted, I'm not complaining _too much_ about it being something _I need,_ because I always have enjoyed a nice bowl every now and then, even before I got sick, but it starts to weigh on you when you realise you're no longer just getting high _for fun,_ and it gets expensive needing to smoke any time I eat, and I'm not financially stable enough to really continue this way; I am grateful to be relying on a natural drug as opposed to shit the Pharma shills try to get me hooked on so I'm drawn into their vortex of addiction, dependence and enabling, though. 

Another nice little positive to the whole thing is that it's gotten so much easier to obtain than it used to be (especially for a socially awkward nobody who lives out in the middle of Buttfuck Nowhere, Manitoba, Canada and doesn't know _any_ dealers personally and had to rely on another pothead to contact her dealer for me; she was a toxic, shady as fuck, _dirty ass lying whore of a ""friend""_ and _you know_ she never let me forget or live any of the times when I'd ask her to pick up for me down -- not that she'd ever _let me_ stop using her as a middle-man anyway, since she'd lose her ability to steal money and weed from me at every chance [sorry for the rant, it's a bit of a sore spot >.<]) since Canada rolled out the big okay for recreational marijuana and opened up dispensaries everywhere -- now there's one twenty minutes away where I can talk to super knowledgeable employees about what strains suit me best and I know if I find a good one I can rely on them to still be carrying it next time I'm there; not like when I was buying unreliable ditch weed from friend-of-a-friend dealers, where you have no idea where it's coming from, if you'll ever be able to get it again, the conditions it was grown in, if the dealer likes you enough to sell to you again or even _what strain you were just sold!_"

2926,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Was a pothead throughout my teens, but much like OP and others here, paranoia, anxiety, etc. ruined it for me. 

The one exception I've discovered were some 100% Indica (pretty sure it was Indica, anyways), 10mg gummies that were recommended by a friend of mine that works for a large edibles company in Colorado, and were among the goodies a group of mutual friends brought back after their 4-20 vacation. 

None of the negatives, just a nice, ~6 hour, full body high. The best, and totally unexpected, aspect of the experience was the complete lack of cravings for dope. Would love to stock up on those bad boys."
2927,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I know sooooo many heroin addicts who won’t smoke weed bc it makes them paranoid... like it’s this very common thing. I feel the EXACT same way- will not touch weed, unless it’s shake, I’m alone, in front of a tv, with copious amounts of food. 

The weird thing is a smoked a shit ton of weed til I was 23/24. Then boom, all of a sudden it’s the worst thing ever."
2928,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I would smoke a little when I was using fent but after I quit fent I got addicted to weed and got high literally any time I possibly could. Now my tolerance to weed is so high that I have to quit for a while. I don’t get high from any amount of weed, edibles, dabs, etc I just can’t get high. My vision gets different and I feel it in my body but I just don’t get high at all. For some reason I’ve never had any anxiety or bad highs from weed, so it was really easy to become dependent on it after fent"

He has one old friend that knows when he is supposed to get the script and shines around only to freeload the pills.  Last month my neighbor said, ""fuck off (name)!""  Lmao.  Anyway, this couple is like family to me, I just LOVE them.  Actually the entire block is all old guys that smoke.  My dad is 74 and smokes too.

Now with heroin I see people all over this thread freaking out if I say something. Ad about it. Y'all all know you are playing a game with life and death every time you shoot up. Maybe your friends freak out you dont smoke weed because you do heavy drugs. Maybe they dont want you to die and they freak out to smoke weed because the chances of dying from a joint is a lot less likely than sticking a needle with some heroin into your veins.

That’s when you know you gotta take it easy. It will be obvious. Although you’ll probably be alright, snorting opioids is relatively easy on the nose compared to more caustic chemicals like meth. 

About the boofing inconsistencies, if it didn’t work the boofer might have done it wrong or they had a giant shit in their pipes blocking absorption or something.

I want to also stress that a minute after snorting, wet your fingers with some water or get a little water cupped in your hand and lean your head back and snort a tiny amount of water. It will help with the drying out of your nostrils and make you feel a little better but it will also help break down any powder stuck to some boogers or whatever since what you’re snorting is water soluble"

2990,is a low flame better to smoke off foil ?(Heroin#3),"It's really difficult to describe without seeing. You want it at an angle so when it's heated and liquifies it runs and makes a trail. Its way better to angle it too steep then too flat. If it's angled too steep the worst that can happen is a hit or two are left on the trail and you can just go back over those spots. If it's too flat it's like a frying pan, it just Burns and bubbles and doesn't run. As for the flame I've always preferred a bic lighter, and only touching the foil with the tip of the flame. 

TL:DR - 45° is generally ideal, but it's better to angle it too much than too little"

3015,You don’t think it’s kinda dangerous to split em tho ?,"If you are only taking half, think of it as taking 40 mg of instant release oxy. So if you normally take 30, this would be like taking 10 more. It's going to hit you slower though. What kind do you have? Like what markings are on the pill"
3016,"If you are only taking half, think of it as taking 40 mg of instant release oxy. So if you normally take 30, this would be like taking 10 more. It's going to hit you slower though. What kind do you have? Like what markings are on the pill",Green OP 80
3017,Green OP 80,"Ok, the OP are the hardest to ""make instant release"".  You could cut this in half and take it and it would still be like taking an extended release pill. The extended release is distributed throughout the pill, it's not just a coating. You'll find that when you go to cut it, it's extremely hard so a pill cutter really is the best way to do it. If I was you I would cut it up into really tiny pieces and parachute it or you can try to chew it up but it's really rubbery. These are the ones that people say to drop in a small glass of Coca-Cola overnight and that breaks the instant release mechanism. With the theory being that it's an acidic solution so it's like sitting in your stomach so the oxy is released. I've done it a few times and it does feel like an instant release pill but I don't know if you wanna weigh 8 hours lol. So your best bet is to chew it up and like I said that would be like taking 40 mg of oxy because that's exactly how much it is"
3018,"If you are only taking half, think of it as taking 40 mg of instant release oxy. So if you normally take 30, this would be like taking 10 more. It's going to hit you slower though. What kind do you have? Like what markings are on the pill",I’ve read that splitting the actual pill causes the “extended release effect” to not happen and people can OD more off of it because it hits faster? True? Or myth?
3019,I’ve read that splitting the actual pill causes the “extended release effect” to not happen and people can OD more off of it because it hits faster? True? Or myth?,"40 mg of oxy is 40 mg of oxy. You don't magically make it more by cutting it up. If you have no tolerance then yeah, I guess making it instant release would be more dangerous. But everybody on here is trying to break that extended release mechanism lol. If you are normally taking instant release pills these are going to feel different. They're not gonna hit as hard or as fast"
3020,You don’t think it’s kinda dangerous to split em tho ?,No
3021,Can you split OxyContin 80?,"Splitting isn’t dangerous.  Dual polymer matrix woven into the shit so the time release is all up in the white shit inside too.  If you want to ER them, you need to chew or dissolve them.  If you cut one in half and then swallow, it will be ER still."
3022,"I was about to inject an OC-40, so wold 1ml of water be enough for the oxy to dissolve in the liquid?","the rigs ur probably using, should be anyway are likely 1ml

so all of the dissolved solids from the pill + 1ml of water won't fit in a rig"
3023,"I was about to inject an OC-40, so wold 1ml of water be enough for the oxy to dissolve in the liquid?","never shot a pill before but have shot heroin, fent, meth and coke. 1ml was always enough when shooting those other things, idk why oxy would be any different.

this sub has a ton of information on shooting safely so I'd suggest make sure you know what you're doing first. good luck and stay safe :)"

3027,Does Taking opiates after working out boost the effects?,"Are you asking if working out potentiates opiates or that opiates enhance a workout? Because they definitely help with workouts and getting a pump, I guess you could feel it more because you’re tired or sore post workout so maybe you’ll feel the pain relief more lol"
3028,Does Taking opiates after working out boost the effects?,"Without a shadow of a doubt. Best to have a small dose before your any cardio, flooded endorphin after Mu agonism is heaven."

3037,"30 days in rehab + probation, or possibly jail+ probation?",I suppose the other part of all this is that you could be sentenced to JUST the rehab and no probation as long as you finished and all that Jazz. What charge are you getting sentenced for and is this your first charge ever?
3038,"30 days in rehab + probation, or possibly jail+ probation?","You probably would get probation but if you are just going to do more dope, what is the point?

We all always need our jobs but active addiction is a great way to lose one.

Plus, if you get probation they will pee test you anyway. So you are probably better off in rehab where that will not be such a hazard."

It could be an allergic reaction like people are saying, you could try taking 25 mg or 50 mg of Benadryl before next time. If you're snorting it, it could be irritating your sinuses. Your sinuses are connected all throughout your head to your ears and eyes. If it's irritating your sinuses you may not necessarily feel it in your nose. It might be backing it up into your eyes as well. After and before you snort you could irrigate with saline (dont irrigate after until you've already begun to feel the effects).

3066,the pill is meant to be extended release for 12’Hours,In your experience did you feel high for the full 12 hours?
3067,In your experience did you feel high for the full 12 hours?,"If your tolerance is truly low, you're much better off splitting it into 2-4 pieces and taking those a few hours apart.

You're likely to get sick and puke if you pop a whole ER 80 with a really low tolerance.

And to answer your question, I'd say the high lasts around 3-6 hours, but again it depends on your tolerance a lot."
3068,In your experience did you feel high for the full 12 hours?,I don't know much about extended release other than the fact that it releases x amount per hour but in my opinion man if you are not opiate tolerant I most certainly would not be taking the entire 80. If someone with more knowledge than me could enlighten me I would greatly appreciate it but whether it's instant release or extended release if you haven't been doing this s*** for a while I think taking the whole 80 would be a bad idea. At the very least I would imagine that you will be throwing your guts up for 12 hours
3069,the pill is meant to be extended release for 12’Hours,6.6666677mg per hour
3070,How long does the high from an 80mg OxyContin last?,The ERs never last the length they say. For me anyways. I’m lucky to get 3 hours out of them. Usually 2.5.
3071,How long does the high from an 80mg OxyContin last?,"“Feeling high” is a sensation linked to your perception. It’s highly subjective, we can’t really tell you how long YOU will be high. 

But an OxyContin, taken whole as intended has a 12 hour window of affect. Subjectively, I always felt them wear off around the 8-10 hour mark."
3072,How long does the high from an 80mg OxyContin last?,If your tolerance is low DO NOT take the whole pill. Figure out your tolerance and split the pill with a pill splitter accordingly.
3073,How long does the high from an 80mg OxyContin last?,"I wouldn’t take much at all then take 10 mg more each hour, and Id say don’t go over 30/40 mg total. If u don’t have a tolerance I think you’ll feel it"

I guess thats why it was easy for me to finally quit, after 11 years, because I dont live with any chronic illnesses like that. I dated a girl with fibromyalgia. She and I got really bad into pills then dope. She got clean right after we split up, I cant imagine how shes dealing with the pain now. I can tell you that I have never had pain in my body and when I was in active addiction when I was in with drawers it would actually cause me to have very severe lower back pain and funnily enough as soon as I got to wait for good I haven't had any pain issues since Sotomayor opiates definitely make pain worse in the long term. 

I really hope you're able to push through and beat this demon that we all carry if that is what you want. Think of all the money you will save and the relationships you can rebuild and think of the future you have without drugs, that's honestly been my biggest motivation that and the fact and my ex-girlfriend is talking to me again.

I'm too old and have done this shit way too many times to count now. It comes a point when you just can't keep putting yourself through the same shit, over and over, you know!? And unfortunately, I'm not a pain patient, no. I got in to this when I was younger through seeing my brother doing it. I started my detox Saturday and my back 'popped', for want of a better word, on Tuesday. Maybe it went before and the gear was masking it, I don't know. And it sounds like you could have had the same happen to you, aha. I've been the same, always illness free when using. No aches, pains, flu etc!

And I have that very same motivation! People on here say not to detox for others, instead do it for yourself. Whereas, I'm doing it for my Mrs that I did it for the last time, also! For me, that's a good enough reason! I nearly lost her to this shit, this time. And I can't lose her... She is everything to me and so much more worth than this devil! Also, now she knows everything, she's really supportive and got me through it with ease the last time. We sat down and talked about shit too, which led us both to buy home drug test kits, to make sure I don't slip up. But as with the original post, the tablets from the Dr's will throw a negative, which is why this last blip is happening. And in my defense, this gear is helping my back right now, so I can do shit until, hopefully, the scan letter comes from the hospital. I'm glad you found another reason to quit, other than yourself! When I see these posts about just doing it for yourself, I always think it's more healthy to have other reasons too! Because they become the gaols that some people can't think about while they're detoxing! And I really hope you get back with her, dude!

And nice! Keep it that way and keep her! I hope it works out well for you! And damn, we're in the same boat, all except this is my 2nd time going through it with my Mrs. And there's no way I'm throwing it away either. There is not one thing that will stop me from showing her that she means more than a devil drug, or anything else for that matter. And that's the thing with this drug too! Most of the people that use are actually nice people, hearts of gold! I like to think I'm one of them. And the same as you, I like to think that my Mrs can see that in me. And to be fair, mine and yours must see it!! They wouldn't have stuck around else... 

Are your drug tests random, or? I used to smoke a LOT of weed, but haven't smoke it for nearly a decade! I tried to smoke it a few months ago, and fuck...!! Weed has been engineered to be so much more potent than I ever remember... I ended up in the hospital, tripping balls and not breathing properly... needless to say, I won't be touching that again, ahaha! I shouldn't even be smoking gear, as 2 years ago, just before Christmas, I run the lighter too close to the foil and blew half of my lung due to the heat! Apparently, lungs are like pockets of grapes, my left lung now is half grape and half tennis ball. Been told not to go scuba diving as the pressure could pop the tennis ball area and cause my lung to rupture/collapse... I also need to stop the cigarettes too. Been smoking for 22 years now, with a 2 month gap back in 2010 after a mini-stroke I had 🙄

And I love that feeling!! The feeling of being clean which comes with that feeling of actually being awake for the first time in... Fuck knows how long!! Its like you've been emotionally disconnected through all the using. You don't notice at the time, as when you're using, you're just numb to everything and think that's 'normal'... But finally waking up! Fuck, I love that feeling!! Its so much better than the high from H, a thousand times better! Awake, a clear head and the energy to even feel just a little motivated... I want that soooooo bad! That and the thought of my Mrs wanting to stay with me... Nothing could ever ruin that, which is why I know I'm going to be free of this shit very, VERY soon.

And I know that feeling only too well!! My Mrs is the same, she won't try to mould me in to the person she wants to be with, she takes me for me and loves me all the same. Which in turn, just makes me want to be a better person for her, to be the person she deserves! Because all the lies and shit that I've fed her these last few months... She deserves sooo much more than that and so much more. I don't think I'll ever be able to say ""that's enough, I've repaid her to what she deserves"", because she'll always be worth more than anyone could give! And you're right! Theres a very big difference! 

Also, I know my Mrs. Loves me, even through all the shit I've put her through. Our first date... I met her on PlentyOfFish(don't know if you have that over there, it's a dating site). We talked on the phone and Skype for a few months. I finally took the dive and drove for an hour and a half to meet her. Our first date consisted of us just chatting shit in her living room, getting a dominoes pizza, 2 beers each... Then we fell asleep on her sofa while having a cuddle and still chatting shit! ahaha!! 😂 in my eyes, it's the best date I've ever been on or heard of, lol. And that date was nearly 5 years ago now!

Hell, I go to the dentist for a root canal and they offer me twelve of them if I’m hurting afterwards, I usually decline them though because I’m off opiates now. There has definitely been a push to keep teens and young adults from any opiates because that’s your primary age where people get turned on to opiates and eventually addicted, it is less likely for people to become addicted as they age. In addition, it’s also more likely for people to age out of addiction if they survive that long. It’s not a rule or anything though."

For the longest I was functioning getting great grades and everything was working out. People would not relate my drug addiction as a problem because it wasn't affecting my every day life. I wish I had someone to say you are a fucking dumbass for continuing to do this shit. I ultimately had to tell myself this because that's ultimately the only person who cared enough. I was selling just about anything so I could buy my drugs and this alone is bad. I was buying praz from black web and pressing xans. One day I ate about 100 xans and blacked out for a few days. Than my dealer offered me a huge bag of fent to press blues. That was the day I decided to quit because I realized how many people would be dying from that shit. It's no way to properly make a blue with fent in your house but people do it anyways. And everyone in this thread knows that and continue to put their life at risk. Anyone who dies from this shit I feel for I really do because I know it isn't easy to quit. But they know the possibilities of buying fake pills that are pressed. They also know they dont wanna feel dope sick when they cant get their clean pills so they'll be okay buying a fake one because hey maybe it will work and you won't die  but I'd rather not take the risk as it seems stupid. If you need drugs to not feel bad about yourself you are caught in a terrible circle. Once you clean up it takes awhile to even start feeling normal again. That's even after the sickness pass.

Coke to me isn’t much of a stimulant in the way that amphetamines are, but more of a euphoriant. In my experience with high purity cocaine, a true coke high is oddly chill and feels very mentally uplifting and talkative. In a sense it’s like an opioid without the sedation or analgesia, but the euphoria and ego boost are still present. 

On the other hand and in my experience, amphetamines are less euphoric than coke (with the exception of MDMA) but they are much more true to the word “stimulant”‘ than yayo is. I get a more adrenaliney, productive high from amphetamines, one that makes mundane tasks much more enjoyable to do, compared to how when I’m on coke all I want to do is focus on the euphoria. 

A way I describe their differences to my less experienced friends is that the amphetamine class of drugs makes doing things feel good, and cocaine makes you feel good to be doing nothing. Unless I am socializing or doing something else that I already find enjoyable, other things can feel as if they are distracting me from honing in on my coke buzz."

3232,"I’m not sure, today I took 60mg in the morning and 60mg before I went to bed last night. If I take 180mg tonight will it be like normal? I’m going to take it with 50mg DPH to make it more potent

Edit: never done opioids before those 2 doses",How do you mean normal?  If you were to take 60mg of codeine right now it would basically feel like what you did this morning.  How did you feel off the 60mg?
3233,How do you mean normal?  If you were to take 60mg of codeine right now it would basically feel like what you did this morning.  How did you feel off the 60mg?,I felt a little sedated and kinda uplifted. By normal I mean would the effects be altered because of previous doses or be how they would’ve without them

3235,How fast of Codeine tolerance develop?,"I'd say about a week and you'll notice the high decreasing. Depends if you're opiate naive or not though. For me, it takes 2 - 3 days for my tolerance to sky rocket but then I am a long term codeine addict constantly hopping off of it then back on"
3236,Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with recreational use of opiates?,its very possible but EXTREMELY difficult
3237,Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with recreational use of opiates?,I'm not necessarily recreational but have been on oxy and oxycodone for 7 years and am still married. Lol
3238,Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with recreational use of opiates?,"I can't speak for everyone but in my own experience and from what I've seen, many people who are using opiates recreationally typically have something going on which makes them look for a drug that's enough to block out that pain. However there are people out there who have pretty great lives and are able to take opiates once in a while just to enjoy the high. I feel like most people who have great lives or are in good mindset will normally do different drugs tho"

The type of person who finds that they can't live without them after a taste is generally someone who is going through life with unresolvable mental distress.  Previously, they have no idea what life feels like without this distress.  Once they discover opioids, and what they can do, there's just no replacement."

When I started out it was actually for a good time and then for blocking out. Emotional pain from the death of my father .. Then I get into a car accident which I broke my hips and legs and had to learn to re walk and making story short chronic and nerve pain. So its for physical pain now but still I go months at a time without using then when I do its no more than 4 days .

I started with other drugs to block out my emotions and thoughts from past events that took place in my life but never touched opiates as I knew how bad they would be for me and how many friends I had lost from them. Well long story short 5 months ago I started experiencing pain in my upper right side of my mouth which made eating and daily life super painful and uncomfortable... I went to the dentist for 2 months straight and I finally got prescribed Tylenol 3's then Norco shortly after. I then seen my Dr and was then switched back to t3's but since my tolerance is higher, it takes many of them to even help slightly. I have permanent nerve damage in my mouth from old dental work.... I take opis for my chronic pain and for my non physical pain..."
3242,Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with recreational use of opiates?,I was able to accomplish this BEFORE MY ADDICTION TO OPIATES. Now I can use them only like once a month or less even but I now getta horrible hangover afterwards that I NEVER got before my physical and mental addiction. Idk kinda doesn’t make sense to me
3243,Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with recreational use of opiates?,Yes but it can be challenging. I used to be a sporadic Heroin user but my physically demanding job didn't mix well with my fibromyalgia so I started using it more and more to kill the physical pain from work until I became physically addicted.
3244,Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with recreational use of opiates?,"I used to only use to numb my life. I'm doing better now, not addicted anymore. I still like to use now and then because...well the opiate high is great lmao. Real hard to keep it in check though, gets out of hand now and then so I need to take breaks."
3245,Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with recreational use of opiates?,I get by with doing opiates about once a month. I crave them everyday but I can control it.
3246,Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with recreational use of opiates?,Ohh yes I am a recreational user .. You could say.. Yes they are addictive and I once was addicted but got clean years ago and now I occasionally use every couple months on a vacation or visiting my family up north.  I will get a couple and do them for a couple days 3-4 days have a good time then I get back home and dont use got months at a time. I have cravings hereand there but I don't feel them out or buy them where I live .. I hsve some fun.. Then go back home to sober living.

During the day i take them together. At night, i take my last Xanax at like 5pm. And no more for the night unless their is an unexpected panic attack. And then i take about 20mg oxy around 8 or 9. Then bed at like 11. I figure its enough time for the Xanax to wear off. I’ve never had any issue.

3383,Currently available RC opiates. Thoughts?,"I've heard certain colored batches of Piperidylthiambutene are inactive. I've seen at at least one post on the subject before.

Also I think PRE-084 is a sigma receptor agonist that's chemically related to PCP.

And O-DSMT is the opioid metabolite of Tramadol so it cuts out having to be a good CYP2D6 metabolizer to get good effects out of it. It's about as strong as Hydrocodone so if you have a tolerance it won't cut it but it's a good alternative for the opioid naive."

3412,What kind of withdrawals should I expect?,"Opiate withdrawals are extremely mental.

If you fully commit and, better yet, situate yourself so you literally cannot use for a week, it's so much easier than if you sit at home debating whether to use or not.

So if you're gonna do it, tie yourself to the mast, delete the numbers from the phone and have someone delete them from your google accounts, give your phone to a friend if necessary, go out of town if possible...

It is seriously so mental. 

You'd probably barely get sick at all if you knew it was literally impossible to use.

Also, gabapentin or pregabalin are your friends."

3414,I agree it is very mental but the physical part is very very real,"There are real physical withdrawals that are not mental in any way.

But, eg, it's a fact that someone detoxing at home when they know they CAN get it and WANT to get it, eg because they need to pass a pee test, will get sicker than someone who is in jail, or who is in a rehab in the middle of nowhere without the funds to get home or even to a city to cop.

I've experienced it and I've heard the story repeatedly.

Last guy told me he did 6 days in jail. On day 6 he was feeling better coming off of dope. Then he finds out he's getting bailed out. IMMEDIATELY he is sweating and getting hot and cold, etc, all ways for that scumbag addict part of his brain to remind him to go use.

All those symptoms that had ended were brought back the moment he heard he would be free and have the opportunity to use. Like his addict neurons wanted to make sure he remembered to use dope even though he had objectively already finished (mostly, was getting was better) withdrawal a day earlier and was sleeping and eating and felt he had a normal temperature.

It's like that for me. At home, I'm a mess. At rehab, I don't feel GREAT by any means, but I sleep (just less) and I feel tired and chilly, versus at home where my body feels like its trying too force me to use."

Just curious as to how it works because I know when I couldn’t get pills or just didn’t take em I damn near wanted to die. After about 24-30ish hours after a line or two of H, the back and joint pains start and the chills kick in. Shortly after that the sweats come but I’ve never really pushed it past that before dosing again."

3420,Why aren’t subs an option? For a drug test? You’re still using other drugs so I’m not understanding why you’re worried about subs and not the other shit?,"I think he’s saying that the subs won’t work for probation because they stay in the body for a lot longer? Like with H/pills, after about 3-7 days of no use, it’s out of the body and won’t show on a drug test, but subs can show on a drug test like a week+ after stopping. I could be wrong about that, but that’s about the only reason I could see someone saying that subs aren’t an option in this situation."

3491,Is doing opiates even really worth it anymore?,"Dude, these are the days where literally anyone with money, an address, some research using modest reading comprehension skills, some minor tech skills, a bit of market research and some patience can get high quality dope delivered to them in bulk at a good price. The slightly smarter and more patient ones will source a few samples and send them in for analysis to get exact compositions of active components and then source a large bulk order off that and be set for a long time.

You can not move from your desk and have a half pound of 60-95% diacetylmorphine at your door in as little as 48 hours in most countries and less than 24 in some.

Yeah the average ignorant user won't do this and will be subject to the garbage of the present market, but you don't have to be the average ignorant. You could even profit off them and they will thank you for it and be safer.

3504,Any of you guys ever sold blood plasma for drug money? What was your experience,"I used to donate plasma at OctaPpasma all the time, and it was usually a pleasant enough experience. The only thing that I didnt like was when they were busy and I had to wait forever till it was my turn, because the actual process took about an hour too. 

They dont drug test you, but you do get a little physical when you first sign up. The first time you donate they send your blood to a lab to test for HIV and a few other things. They also check your vitals everytime and check your plasma levels before hand and if you're too low they tell you to come back the next day. Some people like to go to different places to try to get more money because they only let you donate 2 times a week. They do have you show your arms during the vital check every time and they look for track marks, so if you shoot and have marks they might turn you away. They have a little kiosk with a touch screen computer that you answer the same 20 something questions every time you go. They ask things like if you have been sick since the last visit, been out if the country, gotten a tattoo, paid for sex, live with someone that has HIV, hepatitis, things like that.

The process isnt too bad. I dont shoot up, but I dont really have a problem with the big ass needle they use. It just takes a while because they take your blood, it runs in a machine that separates the red cells from the plasma, then it sends your red cells back into your arm. It does this probably 5 or six times until the bottle is full of plasma, then there's a bag of saline that it pushes into your vein to kind of rehydrate your blood since they took all that plasma out. Like I said the process takes about an hour. Yoire sitting/laying in a comfy chair thing so you're comfortable. They have TVs and wifi. You're allowed to watch stuff and text on your phone, you just cant talk on your phone. 

The money is decent too. At the place I went to you get $75 for your first donation. After that they have a system where you get $25 on your first visit of the week and $50 on your second. Plus they always have special promotions going on. It's either an extra $20 for your 2nd donation of the week. Or they base it on your total donations for the month and you can only do 8 a month since its max 2x a week. Like an extra $25 on your 6th, $30 on your 7th, and $50 on your 8th. Its Definitely worth it of you have nothing else to do and have spare time. You're also helping to save lives and create new medicines. 

Unfortunately they dont give you cash. They give you a prepaid debit card that you have to use and keep track of because they reload the same card everytime you donate. Once the guy in the back scans your plasma bottle the money gets put in your account. It was usually on there by 30 mins after I was done. The card isnt too bad because you can get cash back with it. I would go to publix and buy a soda then get the rest of the $ in cash back since you can pick exact amounts of cash back at publix. 

Sorry for the book I just wrote. Lol. I just have some experience with it, so I figured I'd tell you how it was for me. If you have any more questions, just ask and I'll answer them if I know."

Don't expect to go in and get started right away, itll take about 2 weeks to begin donating. Its not painful after they poke you, and they usually have pretty comfy seating.

3516,Found a 30mg oxy in my bathroom! But i took some kratom?,So drink a couple beers and go to sleep then rail the 30 tomorrow and enjoy it fully!  Instead of not knowing if you’re feeling it did to the Kratom already having you feel 50% of the effects already.  Don’t waste it
3517,Found a 30mg oxy in my bathroom! But i took some kratom?,Yes you will feel full effects
3518,Yes you will feel full effects,Are you sure over on the kratom page theu say waot 24 hours?
3519,Are you sure over on the kratom page theu say waot 24 hours?,I'm positive. The only reason to wait would be because you could get more fucked up than normal. Keaton works on the opiate receptors the same way as the pills do. It doesn't block anything so if you are still feeling the effects of the kratom you will get higher than normal when you do the blue so maybe do a half and see how u feel

3522,Well kratom is an antogonist though? Have you tried the combo?

When i am going to a doctor to get a script for subs, does that somehow make me not an addict while im taking my sub script? Somehow going from buying pills and dope to paying a doctor hundreds for a script of subs or methadone would change you from an addict into just dependent by your logic?  There is no difference imom

Sure you get your dope from a pharmacy but ive met so many people that got hurt bad, got on cpp, then out of nowhere they get cut off.  What would you do if you took your last pill, went to your doctor appointment and either the place was closed with a paper on the door saying ""the doctor got arrested/shut down and sorry for the inconvenience"", or you get inside into a room and the doc comes in and says ""sorry. Heres the numbers for the local methadone clinic. Good luck"" ? 

Would you just shrug your shoulders and go home with no meds and be fine with nothing or maybe spend weeks trying to get into another cpp doctor, only to get in and he says hell give you tramadol or 3- 5mg hydrocodone per day?  Youd be sick as fuck for a week then feel like garbage with no energy for months and months without a script

The last detox i was at there was a ~40year old woman that was in a bad car crash and had full dentures from knocking her teeth out. She got oxy 30s for a long time then out of nowhere the doc gives her the numbers for methadone clinics so she ended up doin dope.

Sure opiates work for pain at first, but with longer use at the same dose, all it does is make you feel normal. Now im not trying to put oxy users down, but even with way stronger opiates like opana and heroin dope, after 20 years theres increasingly diminished effects that i could shoot 2 grams of good dope and id still get better pain relief from tylenol/motrin. My tolerance back in 2010 was 40mg opana per day sniffed and one day i was sick and my friends mom had a few bottles of perk5s unused so i took 16 of em and it didnt even stop the wds and that was a decade ago. I just cant see anyone legitimately taking ~100mg of oxycodone per day for 5-10-20+ years and still be affected by that same dose. After a few months of the same dose all it does is get you dope sick wothout it and when you take it all it does is make you feel unsick.

I guess if it makes you feel better to think youre different cause you get it from a pharmacy then go ahead and keep thinking that way, but you said you already take extra doses to feel good so just that already means you like the high from opiates and that your prescribed dose doesnt do much for you anymore.

Best wishes.","I meant no offense. That's just my opinion on the subject.  I just know that they don't do shit for pain after awhile. They actually make it worse. Your body develops a tolerance by making more opiate receptors in the Brain to handle more n more opiates, then when you don't have that same dose you now are more sensitive to pain.

Opiates change our brain. We will rationalize to make it ok to do the drug.   So basically if you take 80mg oxycontin twice a day, eventually you'll stop feeling That same 80mg dose.

  Now obviously if every day you wake up and take an 80mg oxycontin at 8am then 8pm every day, you'll wake up feeling a little bit dopesick, then take the 80oxy, youre going to feel better.  But instead of getting high you just go from sick(negative high) to feeling normal like ur basically just sober and then you would need to start taking more than 80mg to get the high.  And obviously this isnt scientific, its just a very simple explanation of how taking the same dose eventually just gets you to normal and youd then need to take over 80mg to start getting high from it"

I guess because it's a normal part of my daily life I don't put thought into it these days. I absolutely feel like they dont work as well for pain but I am moderate in my usage. Thank you. It isnt because in trying to get high that I take extra, it's because I have days i can hardly care for myself due to pain. Those days i say fuck it and hope for a better day ahead. The meds arent my only form of pain management but just about the only one I find effective.

3549,Why do people hate addicts or heroin users?,"People don't want to take the time to get to really know someone or understand why they've made the choices they've made. It's easier to put users all under a blanket and call them stupid and/or worthless because it's easier than trying to understand, or makes them feel better about themselves, or both. 

For example, I was having a conversation with this girl and she was going on about how ""I don't know how people get addicted to pills, I was prescribed percs after my wisdom teeth removal and I didn't get addicted!"" ""addiction's not a disease, cancer is a disease!"" pretty much had no clue what she was talking about, and I asked her if she ever tried heroin and just ""No, I'm not stupid!"" in a way that gave off the overwhelming vibe that she was calling ME stupid without actually saying it. She knew nothing about me. So I think a lot of it is just ignorance and an unwillingness to learn anything new or hear people's experiences."

3570,Spitting out saliva after letting suboxone dissolve FOR AROUND 30 mins compared to swallowing? GO!?,My buddy goes to a sub doctor and his dr told him to do this same method. The doc said for whatever reason this is the best method. And he’s been a sub doctor for quite a while.
3571,Spitting out saliva after letting suboxone dissolve FOR AROUND 30 mins compared to swallowing? GO!?,"You want an actual difference in effectiveness via buccal/sublingual RoA? Then you, dear sir or miss, need to take it with a wee bit of ethanol. Seriously. A little ethanol, of your choice, improved rate and effeciency of of bupe absorbtion. 

Use your ethanol of preference, stronger is good, but too strong or too much will cause chemical Burns and be counterproductive because of increased saliva production response resulting in dilution.

Me? I find 55% ABV gin diluted to about half that with water works well, but it's individual.

It makes a significant difference. Not talking placebo either. There is literature easily dug up.

Don't spit. Be a man and savor that bupe with some proper liquor."
3572,Tolerance reset?,"Your tolerance doesn’t increase after your first EVER dose of an opiate/opioid. Up and down regulation plus other factors are the key.

At least to see if it's something I can benefit from. The meetings at the one I've been looking at are about an hour and a half  according to the website. I just can't imagine what they do for that length of time? Also do you usually have to speak? I'm usually more introverted and would just prefer to listen at least the first couple times.

I'm usually more introverted and would just prefer to listen at least the first couple times.,"1.5 hour meetings are very rare unless it's a speaker meeting which is more of an event where everyone comes to watch just 1 person speak and share their story, it's not run like a regular meeting

Generally meetings are 1 hour or 1 hour 15 mins and usually the first 15 mins are doing the readings and handing out coins for clean time anniversaries, etc and the rest of the time is going around the room with each person sharing anywhere from 1 min to 5 mins. It goes by pretty fast for the most part

You are not required to share, ever and you aren't expected to, especially if you are new. If they call on you or ask if you want to share, it's perfectly acceptable to just say ""I'm new here and would just like to listen tonight, thanks"". I'm introverted and hate speaking and I'd pass all the time, it's no big deal.

One last thing, both AA/NA are great, and if you don't care for your first meeting, don't judge it based off that one meeting. Every single meeting is different and I've been to hundreds of different types of meetings with some very different than the others. A lot of factors go into making a meeting what it is, so ""shop around"" and try a bunch of different meetings until you find one that you really vibe with. 

I'd recommend trying some AA meetings as well, even if you are mainly a drug addict and didn't drink. I personally went to AA mainly even though I literally never drank and was a hardcore IV heroin addict for many years. I personally find that AA meetings have more of what I am looking for and NA meetings can sometimes be full of people who just want to talk about who's the biggest baddest junkie. There are great NA meetings out there as well too though.

Good luck buddy and congrats on the clean time. I'm currently kicking dope and right behind you!"

At that point Im hitting 1600-2000 mg of Tylenol at one time. I dont ever go above 1000 mg at at time. Thats why Ive been looking into CWE lately.

&#x200B;

Edit: Ive also read articles based on that as well. Anyone with a normal liver will survive over that by im sure a great amount, but my worry is i take Tylenol every day. Im more so worried about taking damage long term. FDA also caps limit to 1000 mg at a time"
3681,CWE issues?,"Not saying you should do this, or anyone, or that it was smart of me to do, but one night I ate over 8000mgs of APAP. I ate either 25 or 26 10/325 Norcos and when I woke up the next day and realized what I had done I started panicking like oh shit.. thankfully I was fine, but I always CWE after that scare. Even if the shit comes out a little bit cloudy which only happened 1-2 times and it was really barley anything, I still drink it and it gets me just as good as popping them straight up. 

Even if the “ *Up too* 60% “ thing is true and we assume 60% that’s almost half the dose cut off, which isn’t bad at all. You take them everyday so definitely should be CWE that shit, measure out water, extract it,(I like using a cheese cloth or tightly woven shirt for the extract step), find out how many MG per ML you have and dose from that. 

Going up to 25-30mg of the hydrocodone you need for your pain calls for a lot of Tylenol on your way there. A suggestion from me to you would be asking your doctor for the 10/325 pills or at the very least the 7.5/325 pills (assuming the little 5mg oxys are out of the equation). Still CWE them but you would have even less Tylenol obviously, which is what you need imo when daily intake of the medicine is required."

I had a weird experience that kind of spooked me (could be completely coincidental) where i ate Tylenol too close to drinking alcohol and ended up in the hospital the next day with an inflamed pancreas. I was in the hospital for 2 days before it finally started to go back to normal. I never told the drs I drank due to being afraid i would get my pain meds taken away. I never drink and I thought i waited enough time before taking it. 

This is true, and I agree. I have tried to talk to my Dr the past few visits but its hard. I barley get these it seems like, I keep getting told how young I am.

Thats only 1 article that says up to 60% can be left  too, and it could be the highest amount that the study had in just 1 test they did. Like we talked about even if we assume it’s always 60% it’s way better than nothing and you would have to CWE up to 3,350mgs worth of pills to get to the 2000mg mark which comes out to be over 10 pills and 50mgs of hydrocodone. You take them everyday and I can not stress enough how important/and lucky you are with keeping/having your working dose dose in the 20-30mg range. 

If the 30mgs stops working for you you need to cut back and take a break because it’s possible to keep that nice low dose for a very long time, but very easy to slip up. Once you do slip up it’s pretty much game over tolerance wise and you will have to go an extremely long time without the drug to get it back down which is out of the equation in your situation. I’m no doctor or anything but I am an experienced and knowledgeable drug user, especially when it comes to opiates. 

P.S when you CWEcoffe filters work fine, I suggest you double them up though, and always make sure you get the coffee filter wet first before pouring the drugged water through them so you don’t lose anything"

3686,CWE issues?,With as little water as possible there’s physically only a certain amount of paracetamol it can hold. Especially if it is properly cold. You’re not trying to remove it all. Keep the amount of water small. Even a clear result is no good if you have too much water.

3688,I have heard this as well. Some people argue against this but I agree with your logic.,"There's a certain amount of apap you simply cannot remove with a normal CWE. No matter how cold you get it. That amount depends **directly** on how much water you use.

\-- Let's say you are going to CWE 10 percocet 10/325's for easy math's sake. 

\-- [That's 3250mg of apap which requires 232.xxxx ml of water to dissolve it all. ](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Acetaminophen) .

If you used something ridiculous like 233ml of water to dissolve the 10 percs, you would, effectively, dissolve ALL the apap into solution and the **only** way you are going to remove it is by lowering the temperature of the water. And that's **only** if you used close to 232mls of water and not much more.

If you used half that much water which is still a lot, you would have half as much apap in solution which is a good start but we can do better. By using a *much* smaller amount of water we give the apap almost nowhere to hide and so it gets filtered out.

It only takes a ml of water to dissolve 166mg of oxycodone into it so really, we need enough water to dissolve the pills and make it something we can filter but not much more.

What arguments to the contrary have you heard in regards to using more water?"

3690,CWE issues?,"When I do CWE's I use very little water, dissolve the pills in it, wet the filter in tap water and cover a glass with it, then just before I pour it through the filter, will add some ice chips to the water to get it cold then filter it. Sometimes it's cloudy, sometimes it isn't but scientifically, I put more APAP into the glass than the water can hold so I already HAVE to be removing apap. Lowering the temp makes it even harder for apap to dissolve so that number goes up.

Even if I'm only removing half of the apap from 10/325 percs and eating (back in the day) 6-8 at a time, that's only 1300mg a dose which I can live with. I'm pretty certain the extraction is more than 50% efficient though.

I've always felt pretty good about CWEs once I put the thought into the process and did some homework on the solubility of different chemicals (Merck)."

After a 3 month hiatus, I had a two-week fent binge.  Having used it enough, I use a microspatula to eyeball measure a tiny, tiny bit of it (NOT RECOMMENDED on your first time using) -- at least at first.  It was magical, the first time after 3 months of buprenorphine pap.  I may be depressed, but I'm not ready for eternal oblivion yet, so the first couple of times, I would inject a third to a half of it first, see what happens with the needle still in, and then shoot the rest if I felt okay.  Despite my best intentions, I started using it regularly at an escalating dose, and despite the nausea it was causing me after months of not using it.  Just as I was getting into the groove of shooting up five times a day, I ran out.  Luckily, my dosage hadn't gotten out of control yet.  

The only down side is that after a few months, your tolerance is through the roof, and then no amount of buprenorphine will take the edge off when you withdraw.  This time, I only had about 50 mg or so of fentanyl total, so I ran out before that happened.  I upped my dosage of bupe to a full 8 mg strip, but I still felt really crappy yesterday....

I made a 1 mg/mL solution and dosed according to that.  The problem with that is that you need to a way to preserve the solution, otherwise, it is dangerous to IV after a day or so, due to bacterial contamination.  I learned that the hard way after getting a fever and chills (what people call ""cotton fever"", without the cotton) shooting a contaminated batch.  After that, I typically added about 20% ethanol as a preservative.  However, too much ethanol is harsh on the veins.

I've seen friends die on the street, but worse, I've watched family spend the last month of their life in a hospital bed doped up on diamorphine and had the haunting suspicion the doctors do this not for the patient but for the patients family. You know, the same chemical, but its only junkies when its self prescribed and bought from a dealer.

On the other hand I dont think people need to respect any form of glamorisation of recreational use of any drug, alcohol included. For me, drugs are best felt but not seen...","I’ve actually read up on this because at one point I was wondering how drugs became illegal. There really weren’t any bans on any plants/drugs/medicines until the early-mid 20th century. Before then there were unregulated patent medicines that people and companies made for various purposes with random ingredients and that’s where those pics of like “dr Schaffer’s coffee syrup” pop up from and the ingredients are cocaine, morphine and thc lol"

They don't have the strength to have faith in something they build themselves unless someone else tells them it's great, but they're always in denial about their weakness, so they spend all their time breaking other people down and thinking about how successful and strong they are compared to others. It takes a miracle to make a reasonable person, so don't feel bad about anyone being a dickhead, just keep looking for like minds.

You always will be."
3890,Does this shit happen to all of us?,"lol, yes, all the time. But it is important to look at it objectively and not take it personally... it says far more about them than us.

Firstly they hold disgusting, shameful opinions, dehumanizing people with addiction is dehumanizing an enormous chunk of humanity, because many people will have a struggle with addiction at some point, odds are they even know someone who has or has previously been affected by addiction. Dehumanization is the gateway abhorrent human evil, people dehumanize others before they do things like lynching black people, gassing Jewish people, so... yeah...

Second I'm going say they are weak, weak willed, weak arguments, weak everything. They have been totally conditioned by anti-drug propaganda (weak critical thinking skills), they are filled with hate, due to ignorance, they can't form a valid argument (their cognitive minds are weak).

Third. They lack moral fortitude, integrity, basic decency etc. So, when you guys are disagreeing on the cutest age range of kittens, they *creep* into your history and try to hurt you with something from your life that they know many people find painful.

Fourth, they're dumb. Tending not to be bright people at all - based on my experience that's a noticeable trait and not a just a baseless insult. I genuinely believe they have a below average intelligence, but also very sub-normal emotional intelligence.

I could go on and on, but it is common, it is sad, humanity can cause many a sigh, many a rolled eyeball, but I'd trade a heroin addiction that I can overcome than being stuck as somebody that stupid, disgusting, creepy, that mean spirited and soulless. They cannot be happy people, it grosses me out thinking about them.

I've even had my sister, who falls very much into the weak minded camp, use my drug use against me to 'win' an argument or add weight to her child-like attempts to get her own way on family issues. I opened up about my drug use a couple of years ago and I had a LOT of really nasty discrimination from people close to me, but it strengthened my good relationships too.. I'm going off on a tangent, sorry:

3900,My friend is doing the ibogaine treatment?,"Works two ways: 1rst it kind of cleans some receptors so no bodily withdrawals symptoms are present after the treatment (success rate roughly 80%) and 2nd it sends your soul on a ""life-review"" kinda trip so one can see which deep issues are still causing pain.

**It is important for your friend to undergo some cardiac testing before taking the trip (usually done in the clinics, if not they require it, when responsible) cause Iboga can be lethal for people with special heart conditions!**

All in all it is a fantastic kickstart into sobriety, but no magic bullet – the work of getting back into life and dealing with old pain and staying healthy etc. is still to be done by oneself"

I don't think I've heard of anyone dying who had a normal heart ecg. I've had a normal ECG, Ibogaine intrigues me but tbh  half of me is terrified and the other half feels it is too good to be true.  

Plus I've read many stories of people who got clean on it for half a year and then relapsed - 6 months tends to be the relapse point from ibogaine.   For me paying all that cash to go to Mexico from Europe is too much; but I'd like to try a home ibogaine detox (if I had a sitter...)"
3906,My friend is doing the ibogaine treatment?,"I’ve heard from some who have family members who did it and the results were/have been excellent and none have relapsed and they didn’t have any horror stories but just said it was intense and reminded me that as addicts they were always looking for a quick fix and assumed (incorrectly) that Ibogaine was that quick fix bc after the treatment, they still had to find a support system and stay clean."

3908,Pregablin (Lyrica) dosage for WDs. Is it okay to empty a pill and do half?,200-300 mg wouldnt reccomend doing more than that if you have no tolerance someone told me to do 600 mg the first time I took lyrica and felt like shit thought there was a ghost in my room and felt super nauseous. A week later I took 300 mg and felt amazing. Sedating and euphoric.

3911,I got some opium. I'm a heroin/fentanyl addict with about a half gram a day habit. Will it do anything for me?,I love opium more than H but I never had a big H habit. Opium is dirt cheap and lasts a lot longer when done orally. I use it 2-3 times a month and it lasts all day and into the next day but once your tolerance hits a certain level it wont really do much to you but it will be worth keeping around just to mitigate WD. I find opium really strong and heightens my tolerance really quick but like I said I never really had a H habit. The withdrawal also cucked more than a H withdrawal IME(but the longest I binged H for was around 2 weeks - 2 weeks of the tea fucking ruined me)

1) For some reason when I draw up into the syringe, there’s always air I accidentally draw up towards the back of the syringe. And this makes it so when I try and inject, I can’t create another air bubble to check for blood on the other side. How can I avoid this?

2) Do you just poke INTO the cotton and draw? Or THROUGH it?

3) How big should the cotton be? Should it absorb all of the solution or is it okay if it absorbs most and there’s still some in the spoon? I’ve been using cottons the size of like a pea. I notice when I’m done the cotton is still dark like I didn’t draw everything up — or is this normal?"

Also it can blow you vein out too which is no good. Just takes practice.  There were days where I’d cook up a shot and get it in the first hit. Then there were days where it could take up to ten times. But if you try for hours at a time, best to maybe plug lol"
3983,Tips on registering? I have veins people that use are envious of and still have to continuously poke myself... but when someone does it for me they have no issues. I can’t seem to get it.,"Make sure you’re going in at the right angle, just about parallel with the vein"
3984,How soon can I take a sub?,wait until you cannot take the discomfort for another nanosecond ...not sure what drinking a lot of water would do.
3985,How soon can I take a sub?,People ask this question a lot and there really is no exact answer because everyone is different. There is so many variables like how long you've been using and how much you've been using as well as what opiates you've been using. The best advice would be to wait until you're in moderate withdrawals to take any kind of bupe product. Usually if I had waited 24 hours after my last use of heroin I was in the clear to take subs. But the one time I transitioned from hydrocodone to bupe I only had to wait 12 hours. Really the longer you wait the better.
3986,How soon can I take a sub?,Suboxone has answers to this on their website. Like a whole ass chart lmao. I believe heroin is 12-24 hrs on that chart
3987,How soon can I take a sub?,Try and get to 24 hours

4015,How long until heroin/ fent withdrawal starts. In number of days?,For me mild H withdrawal starts after even 2 days on continuous use.  If I buy a gr kill it I'm 2-3 days and then stop its mild but real shitty withdrawals. A month daily and it starts to get hellish
4016,How long until heroin/ fent withdrawal starts. In number of days?,[deleted]

4018,Like how many day of continuous use will I start to withdraw,"For me, three days."
4019,How long until heroin/ fent withdrawal starts. In number of days?,2-3 days of continuous use will cause withdrawal if you been dependent before.
4020,How long until heroin/ fent withdrawal starts. In number of days?,"I’m confused 🤷‍♂️ withdrawals would probably start within 24hours. They will last probably around 1-2 weeks. as for the od question I can’t answer that and you shouldn’t just listen to a stranger on here, you should know how much you need not to go over 😉"
4021,When would I start subs?,"Wait till you can’t hardly take your W/d symptoms.

Wait till your in full W/do’s: runny nose/eyes, shitting your brains out, that deep deep depression that turns every thing hopeless and gray etc...

Then take a strip and hold it under your tongue.

The relief should start about 30-45 mins after you dose the bupe. 

If you dose sub too soon you can go through precipitated W/d’s as the bupe strips off the opioids left in your brain. 

Waiting till your in noticeable w/d is how the clinical literature says is best.

24 hours isn’t a set in stone kinda guideline. Everyone is different so I would just go with how your feeling."
4022,When would I start subs?,why bother do some kratom or score some fent
4023,why bother do some kratom or score some fent,"I'm just trying to stop entirely.  Im a senior in college, set to graduate soon.  Ive successfully managed my usage the last year but it's time to stop before I truly get addicted addicted.  I don't plan on using the subs forever, but moreso as an easier way to get off the H.  Like If I just used subs, tapering down from the start, I assume I could get off the H and only need the subs for 2 weeks-1 month.

&#x200B;

I wouldnt have a problem stopping if it weren't for the withdrawals, which subs can deter."
4024,When would I start subs?,If its fent wait at least 36 hours minimum and wait till you feel like you are fucked like pour sweat and pissing out your ass..  I go into precipitated even after 36..  sometimes I know it's gonna happen but just want to get the ball rolling.. sucks
4025,When would I start subs?,Start the subs once you feel sick. If you take them to early it will send you in to pwds which is absolutely miserable and 100 times worse then waiting the 24 hours an being in the beginning stages of withdrawal.

4057,How fucked am I?,"Depends on a few things. How long ago you first started using, your metabolism, how much you used during your mini bender, how strong was the shit, ect.

Overall, it probably won't be the worst. But try to get some subs, kratom, weed, xanax, clonidine, even lope (worst case scenario) if you have too. Any of those would help a bunch. I know it sucks.

I have definitely heard that (no euphoria) before though just not my experience or anyone I’ve talked to in person.",What do you mean? Good heroin is muchhhhhh better than fent and %99 people can attest to it. I’ve literally had pharmaceutical fentanyl before in the form of a patch. Just cut a little off and smoke it. And while it was very sedating it last about an hour with very little euphoria.

Just cut a little off and smoke it. And while it was very sedating it last about an hour with very little euphoria.,"I definitely would prefer H but I never would do that much or that often. Got fentanyl/heroin (I think I even paid more for that sample) then smoked the whole bag in 2 nights of heavy smoking when normally the same amount of (I think relatively high purity) heroin had lasted a week or two. Smoking it I got some of my best highs in my life but would throw up and black out like every hour. 

That could just be because there was a little bit of heroin and I was just smoking more than I normally would’ve in addition to fentanyl. Didn’t know it had fentanyl until I had finished it and the friend who bought it told me it tested. And people with the patch have said that it’s just hours of bliss."
4090,What would happen if I smoked a fent pressed 30?,If ypur lit off of 30 mg oc you prob shouldnt play with fent if you do i would take one small hit at a timen wait a bit how do u know its pressed
4091,If ypur lit off of 30 mg oc you prob shouldnt play with fent if you do i would take one small hit at a timen wait a bit how do u know its pressed,My buddy with a lower tolerance ODd off half last night and is bringing it over to me to test with fent strips.
4092,My buddy with a lower tolerance ODd off half last night and is bringing it over to me to test with fent strips.,"OD'd on half a 30? Wonder what the results will be 🤔🤔🤔




Edit: Oh and Id make a volumetric solution with the assumption it's 50% pure fent and work your way up with boofed doses. 



I.e. if the pill piece weighs 100mg, then dissolve it in water with the assumption its 50mg of fentanyl. 


100mL water=.5mg/mL, a starting dose of fent for you would be maybe .1, so boof a fifth of a mililiter and then adjust accordingly. 



Be sure to A- make sure fent is water soluble (90% sure it is, but not actually positive) and B- put the sealed bottle of fent-water in a tub of warm water for a little while and shake it really well before each use



If you really wanna be safe, assume the pill is 100% fent. Or even 100% carfent


Oh and it most likely contains less than a couple miligrams so youll have to end up taking way more than a fifth of a mL. But better safe than sorry."

4099,It’s not like I want to graduate to fent but it’s getting impossible to be a pill addict anymore and I don’t have any desire to go sober.,Tbh heroin is safer than those fent 30s. Do not underestimate there. I know people with huge tolerances end up in the er from less than a whole fent 30. 30 mgs of oxycodone ain't shit compared to some of those presses.
4100,It’s not like I want to graduate to fent but it’s getting impossible to be a pill addict anymore and I don’t have any desire to go sober.,Not worth it bud. Take a tolerance break off the oxy and keep stickin with that. maybe try a different roa?

But I would buy test strips to be safe. Tar is pretty easy to tell if real or not. It should smell like vinegar and taste bitter. (I know its sounds weird but if you lick it you can usually tell because its bitter as fuck.) West coast tar is usually WAY safer than fent 30s. I've been using tar for over a year now and only got fetty in my tar 4 or 5 times.  The problem with fent 30s is you dont know how much is in them. Sometimes they're bunk other times they're way too strong. With your tolerance I would stay far away from fent 30s.

So who knows how many mg might be in whatever or hitting a hot spot plus with fent ur eather passed or getting sick or dead its not worth it"
4113,What would happen if I smoked a fent pressed 30?,you really dont need to with your current tolerance. The only time I would ever recommend fent is when tolerance gets so high that you can no longer get a buzz. Even then I would still recommend time off before going to fent because tolerance is a never ending cycle.

I'm on the east coast and I've copped off blocks with crazy fentalogues, and only OD'ed once by being reckless and doing a fat line of dope I haven't tested, even though it was a stamp I hadnt had before off a block I hadn't copped before. But ime, if it's mostly heroin with mb a little bit of fent and you do testers, you'll usually end up being fine. It's def wayyyy safer to get dope than fent 30s, fent doesn't even feel euphoric like oxy and dope, it just makes you nod out."

4153,"Holy fuck dude, glad to hear you're still breathing !",Me too! Be safe out there brotha!!!
4154,How quickly do Heroin overdoses after using?,"Depends on just how hard they OD'd and ROA.

Smoking hits you really quick, but is hard to OD on because you have to take it one hit at a time. Snorting starts hitting you in about 5 minutes and is fully kicked in by 30 minutes, so it could be anywhere from 5 to 30 depending on just how much you took, more drug=less time

Shooting, less than 5 minutes regardless of dosage. Instantly if it was way too much.

I hope this helps."
4155,How quickly do Heroin overdoses after using?,"I have OD'd right away from IV use and after about 30 minutes with nasal use. It depends on the strength of the dope, the ROA, and if you have anything else in your system. It is different for everyone I'd think."

4164,For months clean? Should I still feel like this?,there is no way you should still be having withdrawal symptoms after that length of time. The fact that gaba helps leads me to believe you may have an underlying condition.

When I first got on subs I still felt like I was in minor withdrawal for the entire first day and a good portion of the 2nd if I remember correctly. This was switching over from 1-1.5 g’s of BTH per day. However, the further from my last use I got the better I felt. 

These days I jump back and forth so much that the subs will hardly touch my withdrawals. Last time I tried to switch over I took 24 mg’s throughout the day and was still sick AF. Ended up buying more fucking heroin because I couldn’t ride it out lmao"

4196,Why so hard to Stay Off opiates?,I think its all individual. Some people come back 100 percent while some don't. I think our environment and lives have a lot to do with it. For instance if youre homeless or have always been depressed then it may be harder to enjoy sober life with nithing to look forward too. But if youre a successful person with a good job and family.. When you get clean you may truly enjoy it and have motivation because there is morr to enjoy. It's also important to try and progress when you're clean.

If I wasn't opioid dependent I'd play around with them for the sake of novelty, perhaps one day when my tolerance lowers although I'll likely try rectal or intranasal usage as I despise needles... 😫

Bulk (a box of 28 or more) it was only £10 per 80, so maybe ask about bulk prices too? But for that price I’d totally pick up one or two just to test out.

I also gave up looking a long time ago, perhaps it's time for me to do more research 

I'm in the same area you are - I know I have it, have probably had it my entire life. I'm intolerant to CBD products.

I take low dose kratom a few times a week, that helps a little. Afraid to go any higher because I don't want any dependance to grow. 

I've supplemented with various supplements that support GABA production to mild changes. I work out a few times a week; that usually helps. I use other supplements (vitamin D, as an example) that help a little. I take supplements / try modalities that ease the CNS and address the adrenal glands. Helps, but in my case my anxiety isn't too severe. 

I've learned how to mitigate the low grade pain I seem to always hover around in with stretching, yoga, hot baths, supplements, PT, etc. 

Part of it is time and age; I've gotten older and more used to navigating the world in my body. I'm grateful for being able to have these things in my life. 

BUT - None of those things come close to opiates. 

The first time I tried opiates I finally felt Normal. Not HIGH (that came later) just NORMAL. 

That's the way I feel on low dose opiates. I feel NORMAL.

The way I want to feel, every day, is just FUCKING NORMAL. 

You kinda reinvigorating me to look at this again and dive into the medical literature and see what's new. If you find anything out there, let me know.

I'm in the same area you are - I know I have it, have probably had it my entire life. I'm intolerant to CBD products.

I take low dose kratom a few times a week, that helps a little. Afraid to go any higher because I don't want any dependance to grow. 

I've supplemented with various supplements that support GABA production to mild changes. I work out a few times a week; that usually helps. I use other supplements (vitamin D, as an example) that help a little. I take supplements / try modalities that ease the CNS and address the adrenal glands.

Also, ever tried kava? It's pricey but may be helpful for you to use every so often. Supposedly it increases GABA receptor density (GABA helps the nerves to relax) and supposedly isn't physically addictive like benzodiazepines are.

I think I'll get some naltrexone and start with 0.5-1mg. Its use in treatment of opiate addiction and alcoholism is enough for me to try it out.

I'm really worried about getting sucked in to full on alcohol, benzo and opiate addiction because they're really the only things that make me feel content."

SSRIs are garbage drugs that only help a minority of people; and people are constantly forgetting or are simply unaware that there are other antidepressants available out there as well. The fact that you prefer the more stimulating opioids like tramadol, tapentadol and oxycodone with tramadol and tapentadol being very strong noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors could mean that you have a problem with low noradrenaline and dopamine. Just a gut feeling but your uneasiness and preference for the stimulating opioids could be symptoms of having ADHD.

You should look into more stimulating ADs like Wellbutrin, Nortriptyline and MAOIs - and also have a psychiatrist screen you for ADHD which could give you scripts of stimulants to try as well. All these medicines will boost your natural endogenous opioid production as the monoamine system is heavily interlinked with the opioid one. If you still have cravings for opioids you could combine your AD with maybe suboxone or kratom. Oh and by the way, kratom is a great replacement for those dirty acting shit drugs tramadol and tapentadol. Unlike tramadol and tapentadol kratom can also be combined with any antidepressant including MAOIs. Probably want to avoid taking SSRIs/SNRIs/strong SRI drugs for your problems and if you already found no relief from SSRIs.

But yes I do believe that in some people there definitely is an endogenous opioid deficiency - these people probably need to be on opioid replacement therapy (ie sub/methadone) for life. If you suffer from anxiety and depression other antidepressants will be helping you as well in combatting these problems and your possible natural opioid deficient state - but some unfortunate few people may still need an opioid of course.

I would want to say though that depressed people in general probably are in a constant low endogenous opioid/endorphinic state, but for some or a lot of these people other antidepressants will raise endogenous opioids through downstream action enough to restore them to normal levels."

I have often wondered recently if I do in fact have ADHD. I took amphetamine once, and I could definitely focus and do things better and felt more content, but the physical tension/unease issue I have wasn't really helped, if not worsened. I am generally sensitive to stimulants and avoid them. But don't really fully remember the amphetamine experience since it was so long ago. Also don't know exactly the dose I took, so you may have a point there.

I think I'm more likely to be aspergers. It's hard to get an actual real diagnosis where I live. I just know that SOMETHING is off and I've started self-medicating to get relief. I have no reason to be how I am, other than some mental deficiency. I didn't have that bad a childhood, get abused or bullied, or anything like that. Just have anxiety and some related depression. The anxiety is worse and really wears me down to a point of almost constant fatigue and irritability.

Do you think I should ask my doc about tianeptine? That's a tri-cyclic antidepressant and opioid agonist. I actually tried Amitriptyline (a TCA) a few times, but the constipation was horrible, so doubt I would do well on tianeptine unless I did some anti-constipation protocol, too."

Well yes, not everyone with ADHD responds well to amphetamines or other stimulants but usually they can find something that helps. Also if you have no idea what dose you took or even the quality of the shit you were taking then that doesn't really say much either. If it was some powder it could have been anything really, like some dirty rc, and racemic street amphetamines can be quite different from pure dextroamphetamine in terms of potential side-effects.

>I think I'm more likely to be aspergers. It's hard to get an actual real diagnosis where I live. I just know that SOMETHING is off and I've started self-medicating to get relief.

Well you could be all three, or four of those: Asperger with comorbid depression, anxiety and ADHD. The combo of Asperger or autism with ADHD is extremely common. Depression too.

>Do you think I should ask my doc about tianeptine? That's a tri-cyclic antidepressant and opioid agonist. I actually tried Amitriptyline (a TCA) a few times, but the constipation was horrible, so doubt I would do well on tianeptine unless I did some anti-constipation protocol, too.

Maybe, if you won't abuse it. Tianeptine is technically a TCA but their effects are nothing alike!! Tianeptine lacks anticholinergic and adrenergic properties - so it most likely will not cause constipation. As for a comparison, when I tried tianeptine at 50 mg daily, I actually had increased bowel movements!

This may seem a little extreme but you may maybe want to look into MAOIs also. Moclobemide could be a good alternative and you usually don't have to follow any dietary restrictions on it, though probably don't want to eat tyramine rich foods in excess. You can combine Moclobemide or any other MAOI for that matter with both tianeptine and for example bupropion."

4291,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,"I moved out of state, but my plugs actually still hit me up to check on me and talk.  Had one hit me up for “that white boys number” yesterday, I asked what that made me (I’m white) and he said “my nigga”, so I guess good...pretty solid, lol."
4292,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,My plugs great. My fiancée and I get free drugs for trading sexual favors. Sounds bad but it’s very good.
4293,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,Me and my last plug became close friends. Before that I was coping from corner boys or hood cp plugs. Those were just like any other business relationships. We acted like friends during deals because we both had what each other wanted but that was it.
4294,What’s your relationship w/ your plug like?,"My plug is my best friend.

Not  that my best friend happenes to be my plug, he just became my best friends over time. He fully trust me and I fully trust him. At some point he even started looking into his hiding spot for money while I was there. He know he can trust me.

He doesn't deal h though, but high quality coke and can also get his hand on pretty much anything if I ask him. He's a really good guy. We're planning on tripping on acid this week with my girlfriend."
4295,Nyquil for sleep during detox?,"It could possibly cause RLS, everybody is different. For me personally when I'm in withdrawal the only thing that puts me to sleep is more opiates sadly. I've tried benadryl, nyquil, seroquel, remeron, ambien, and multiple different benzos but for me personally none of it does the trick. Most of them actually make my RLS worse even after taking something like requip on top of them to combat it. But I know a lot of people that say some of that stuff helps them get at least a couple hours of sleep, especially benzos."

High benzo dose also lets me sleep but I’m on a tight leash with that prescription because of past abuse so I can’t really do it eveytime. Everything else (Bendryl, Nyquill, Nytol etc) gives me RLS in high enough doses for me to sleep. Robaxacet with carbomethamol (spelling?) might work but I wish it didn’t come with Ibuprofen/Acetominophen/Aspirin...! Micro-dose of opiates works but I try to avoid it."
4297,Gout and dope?,that sucks.. i've seen people dealing with gout and its not pleasant looking.  dont jump to gout right away though because there are specific criteria for gout that only a doctor could diagnose.. hopefully its just a one-off situation ya know.  and hope that powder didnt kill your kidneys lol

""too much seafood or red meat""...lol"

4303,What does the gout in your foot feel like?,"Omg it was horrid. So first my foot felt really stiff like I had a cramp I couldn't shake. Then it turned bright red, got all swollen and hot at the base of the toes! The swelling went down a bit, now it looks like a black and blue mark. Still hurts, too."

4305,"I dont think thats gout... i mean it could be idk what that actually means in all fairness, but I got what yore describing when i was shooting in my feet... do you shoot anywhere under your hips?","Nope, just my arm. It's definitely gout, I've seen it in my patients at work many times. I just never heard of it happening as a result of opiate use."
4306,Opiates and etizolam?,"Yup, I've tried it. I woke up in the middle of a busy street surrounded by paramedics. Definitely not safe especially because Etizolam gives you the delusion of sobriety (you think you're sober even though you're absolutely fucked up)"
4307,Opiates and etizolam?,"Yeah pretty dangerous. I mean benzos are pretty safe on their own, but add them on top of any other CNS/ specifically respiratory system depressant and it can easily turn your lights out for good. That being said I used to be heavy on the opiates and could easily take 2mg of etizolam on top of my dose without any noticeable ill effects. But I wouldn’t recommend it. Opiates were just as fun without etizolam, and all the etizolam did was make me careless enough to do a little too much dope and pass out too early. Just really wouldn’t recommend it man"
4308,Opiates and etizolam?,No fucking way.
4309,Opiates and etizolam?,It can be dangerous when you mix too much.
4310,Opiates and etizolam?,"If you take very small amounts, it's fine. The problem comes with re-dosing and not knowing how prone you are to it. We all lose some self-control when under the influence.

So, not recommended. Just stick to one or the other."
4311,Opiates and etizolam?,NO
4312,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,Shit forever lol how long u been using
4313,Shit forever lol how long u been using,"Fuck man that’s what it seems to be for me. I quit 3 months ago. Tried to get high on prescription roxi for my birthday (not a relapse, just a planned celebratory single dose) and I snorted all 3 of the pills I bought within an hour and still did not feel high. I suppose this is because I used to use fentanyl pressed pills and my tolerance was sky high, coupled with the fact that I’ve been using kratom for maintenance. But still, after 3 months I expected to easily be able to get high with 30-45mg of oxy. But nope, not even 90mg was enough. Crazy how tolerance works. I think it depends a lot of whether you’ve been totally clean or using something for maintenance though."

4316,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,"This is prolly the last thing you wanna hear but I stopped taking oxy for 2 years and tried it again after and needed around 100mg to feel anything which was similar to the dose I was taking before I quit. Idk why but my tolerance I sincerely believe will never return to normal, hope you don’t have the same problem lmfaooo"
4317,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?," Honestly, when I read these tolerance questions regarding opiates, I recommend just getting off and staying off..find another drug class to experiment with as its just not worth the possible trouble..

  Once someone gets addicted or develop tolersnce, it takes several weeks of clean time before opiates regain any sort of magic ..they can still get you high but tolerance will develop at a very fast rate if you start using them with any regularity.."
4318,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,Month
4319,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Depends on tollerenca im sure some would die off of 120 mg
4320,Depends on tollerenca im sure some would die off of 120 mg,I have used alot of tramadol so i think my tollerance would be a bit higher
4321,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,"With no tolerance a 30mg amount will be perfect! Honestly you will get rocked, don’t listen to the people going above this until you gauge for yourself."
4322,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Go slow with it try 40 mg if 25 was weak
4323,Go slow with it try 40 mg if 25 was weak,Never tried oxy so i wondered if 25mg was enough. Also will mixing oxy with other opiates like cosylan and tramadol potentiate it
4324,Never tried oxy so i wondered if 25mg was enough. Also will mixing oxy with other opiates like cosylan and tramadol potentiate it,[deleted]
4325,[deleted],Benadryl is impossible to get here. I have some antihistamines. Is oxy liver toxic? I am on alot of methyl tren now and have to be careful.
4326,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,35 mg of oxy should have u feeling good chew it up and youll be vibing within the hour
4327,35 mg of oxy should have u feeling good chew it up and youll be vibing within the hour,Will i nod out on such a dose?
4328,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Well do youbtake tramodol everyday n how much of it do ubtake
4329,Well do youbtake tramodol everyday n how much of it do ubtake,Not everyday but i have had binges and i take it whenever it is avaible. I have to take about 500mg staggered to get completly fucked up
4330,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,First off do u know you can have seizures from doses that high of tram.. Second oxy is alot stonger start with no more then 25 mg

4351,Its hard to quit when you totally dont want too.,A big part of me does want to quit. Really more than anything. But I feel like that addict part of my brain won’t give up. Like my brain is being controlled and it’s a constant battle between what I want and what my brain thinks I want.

I wanted to quit just like you. But would mess up Every time and try and justify it. Eventually we have to be honest with ourselves and admit you aren't totally ready. Just that realization made me want to quit Even more. And when I eventually did quit it was a lil different and i knew i HAD to stop. It doesn't have to happen that way. But it did for me. I always knew I wanted to quit but wouldn't act on it. The letdown you give yourself fucking hurts lol. Telling yourself. You'll quit but never do.

I'm going through the same things myself so I understand I'm just going through withdrawals of over 12+ years opiates  now on suboxone but I'm in terrible pain so I use cbd .

""If you take hydrocodone or oxycodone and either bupropion, dacomitinib, fluoxetine, hydroquinidine, paroxetine, or quinidine together, your pain medicine may not work as well.""

So i would guess no. Ive never heard of using it to potentiate either. Did someone tell you they do?"
4383,Wellbutrin as a potenator?,Wellbutrin has a stimulant like effect so no
4384,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,"Yea bud. doesnt even really matter your weight. Even with zero tolerance youd just get a pretty solid nod going with that.

Edit:
Your weight definitely matters. i just mean that even at a low weight (120lb) you wouldnt really overdose.
Im no doctor though. I just know from experience.

Stay safe!"
4385,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,"We are not doctors so we cannot tell you what is safe and what is not safe. What I can say, is you can always take more, but you can never take less. So take some and evaluate how you feel in 30 minutes if you're okay, take a bit more, and so forth until you've reached your desired sweet spot. 

Also, just because it seems like you're early on in your addiction, consider quitting now. It's a lot easier to walk away while it's still a choice. That's all I'm gonna say on that because I don't want to patronize you."
4386,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,Yes because morphine has a low oral bioavailability but I wouldn't take it if you're on Oxy as that's a waste imo. If you want to add to the Oxycodone you already took take 25 to 50 milligrams of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).
4387,Yes because morphine has a low oral bioavailability but I wouldn't take it if you're on Oxy as that's a waste imo. If you want to add to the Oxycodone you already took take 25 to 50 milligrams of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).,What would be the best way to take the morphine?

4391,"I looked on psychonaut and it didn’t say anything about the two being dangerous I’ve took 500mg of tramadol anyway, feeling nice lol","Everyone’s different.  The danger with tramadol is more related to seizures, whereas codeine would just be respiratory depression really (or allergic reaction in a VERY rare instance).  If I were you, I’d just pick up an antihistamine like Doxylamine and take a dose of that with my codeine.  Definitely helps stop itching."

4395,"I mean, it’s probably not the safest idea, but I’ve heard loads of success stories, so it’s definitely possible.,, girls and guys included... just dress down don’t act flashy and never let your money walk","I've cold copped successfully hundreds of times (100% success rate) in a Major City that rhymes with smalltimore. I'm a 28 year old white dude who weighs 140 lbs. And I was the only white guy in the entire area. Just stay alert and read the situation, it's not that hard here where I live. If you're worried about getting robbed or sold fake stuff maybe just buy a little bit so that you can go to try it and if it's good go buy more"

4398,Is cold copping a horrible idea?,Look if you ain't shady looking it don't matter much. They want your business. Honestly IMO I find it easier for a female to do this than a male. Dealers trust females more and don't think they would set them up
4399,Is cold copping a horrible idea?,"Not to be sexist but for a girl I’d recommend against going out alone at night.  It’s the street and people are fucking mentally sick, desperate, and don’t give a fuck about anyone life including their own.  

Can you get a buddy to go with you?  I only say this because every girl that’s ever told me about trying to cold cop in cities said they just got taken advantage of, groped, or worse.  

At least go during the day, and to an area with considerable numbers of people around

If you must go alone at night, AT LEAST bring some form of protection.  Taser, gun if you’re bout that, etc... 

Funny story (and genius idea for peace lovers/tree huggers)... someone I know actually brought a small concealable bullhorn/megaphone with her to cold cop - though I’m sure a dollar store air horn can would work just fine - and when a group of old men ended up approaching and threatening her, she “blooooop’d” it real quick and said “y’all  wouldn’t believe how loud this shit gets”

The pussies scattered faster than light flashed rats lol"

4401,Hypnagogia. Similar to that half awake half asleep feeling you may get as your falling asleep or if you only partly wake up. Google it.,lol such a weird word
4402,What exactly is “nodding out” and why does it feel so good?,"Neat question, but I feel like the answer might be so in-depth that it wouldn't mean that much to a layperson. Hopefully not though and someone answers. Even complicated things can sometimes be simplified to an extent that it can be understood to a lesser degree, but some things just require you to do the time to learn all the knowledge underpinning the understanding.

I know (and I mean know in the loosest possible sense) that benzos work by doing something to a certain chemical ""gate"" that moves things (ions?) from one place to another in the brain, which I think inhibits the effect of something called GABA at certain receptors. I've read that this is why mixing barbiturates and benzos is so lethal, because while one type of medication reduces or increases the number of these chemicals or ions, the other reduces or increases the frequency, meaning 2+2=8. I wonder if opiates work a similar way?

I had a look on wikipedia, on the [endorphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins) page:

>In the [PNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system), endorphins, primarily β-endorphin, are released from the pituitary gland and bind to μ-receptors. The binding of these two components inhibits the pain signal of the periphery nerves by blocking the neurotransmitter [substance P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_P). The mechanism in the CNS is similar but works by blocking a different neurotransmitter. When the endorphin binds to the μ-receptor, it inhibits the release of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which, in turn, increases the production and release of dopamine, the neurotransmitter associated with pleasure.\[15\]\[16\]

So it seems that opiates inhibit the release of GABA, but whether this is true of all opiates or just endorphins I don't know. But as far as I can tell there are a bunch of different opiate receptors with varying effects, and each opiate will have a distinct binding profile.

Whether this is significant or not, it seems that opiate receptors are considered ""G protein-coupled receptor"" ( ...constitute a large [protein family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_family) of [receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor) that detect [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) outside the [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) and activate internal [signal transduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction) pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses.). From wiki page on GABA:

>Two general classes of GABA receptor are known:\[3\]  
>  
>GABAA in which the receptor is part of a ligand-gated ion channel complex  
>  
>GABAB metabotropic receptors, which are **G protein-coupled receptors** that open or close ion channels via intermediaries (G proteins)  
>  
>Neurons that produce GABA as their output are called GABAergic neurons, and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the adult vertebrate.

So as far as I can tell opiates inhibit GABA and in turn causes dopamine to be produced. So they cause drowsiness in a similar way many ""drowsy"" medications do, such as benzos, but how similarly I don't know. I simply don't have the knowledge to know whether most of what I've written is right, because I don't have the more fundamental understanding of how the brain works, so don't take any of this as gospel. A little bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Whether we could understand to any meaningful extent an explanation beyond ""it does things to the chemicals in your brain"", who knows. Hopefully someone with the expertise can reply and try their best to dumb it down for us. May be worth posting this on ELI5 or another ask questions sub if you're really interested.

edit: Also worth keeping in mind that we don't fully understand how many medications work, opiates probably included. From [here](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/opioids-mechanisms-of-action):

>Inhibition of neurotransmitter release is considered to be the major mechanism of action responsible for the clinical effects of opioids. Nevertheless, despite extensive investigation, understanding of the cellular actions of morphine and other opioids is incomplete."

You won't make it home at all if you wreck and die, or even worse, kill someone else (worse bc you already knew the risks you were taking while driving high, those other people didn't sign up for that even if everyone knows that there is technically a chance of dying from getting hit by a driver under the influence every time they get in their car, you still don't expect it and shouldn't have to).

I always leave my rigs at home to make it easier to wait so that I couldn't do my shit even if I wanted to. Plus when you wait until you get home that makes the shot that much better bc you can just sit and enjoy it without having to worry about someone seeing you do it in your car or call the cops bc you're taking too long in the circle k bathroom so they assume you're shooting up, or have to worry about getting pulled over bc you're driving extra shitty since you're high.

4449,Anyone had a piss test sent to the lab while using fake pee (quickfix in my case)? What was your experience?,"You’re fine. Most employers have a contract with a certain lab, so they collect it wherever is convenient for you then ship it to thier lab. 

Just went through this a few weeks ago and i read a few stories online about people getting busted for substituting. The few of these stories that come up are suspicious. They usually are from new account users and don’t have many details. This leads me to believe that the reviews are fake perhaps from a shill for a different synthetic urine company. 

I also think that if you give the person administering the test any reason to suspect you may have just substituted they may have some BS protocol they go through to make you perform an observed test. Things such as taking way too long in the bathroom, or making noise with the bottle, leaving the bottle or cap in the bathroom. 

If its on temp and looks like pee the person administering the test cant really do anything even if they do suspect something.  If you made it past the initial validity testing done there at the collection site and they poured it into tubes and shipped it you are fine."

I'd take a dose with me, in my pocket, during the interview. If you feel you need it, do it. I've done it before when I came back to work on day 6 - I had a small dose on me. I got through the shift without it in the end as I felt better at the end of the day.

Thank goodness... It's based on education, experience, and skill.  They will check references but not a problem.  I'm actually a model employee as far as work and productions is concerned.  Have been in leadership departments of past employment locations for past 15 years.  Developed this problem really in 2015 but started when I broke my leg in 2002.  Funny...I enjoyed opioids then, and was in surgeries for 3 years straight... prescribed Opioids the ENTIRE 3 years.  Soon as I healed, didn't even ween off... just stopped.  And I know it's crazy, and maybe ignorance is bliss, but I swear I did not experience any withdrawals then.  

I didn't touch a single opiate until maybe 2005-8 at a party or two.... then nothing for 7 years.  A co worker had a steady supply and that's when I really began to enjoy the oxy ride.  It's so strange to me I could do 3 straight years of Oxy and stop without thinking about it before, but now that I know withdrawals are associated with stopping, I swear it makes it 1000 times worse.  Plus, I was in my early 20's back then so maybe my body processed the chemicals easier...kinda like when you're young and never used to get hangovers....now they last 3 days lol."

I know I was over the worst at the end of day 3/early day 4 so was fine until they moved up the interview.

And @\_morpheus\_23 - You're exactly right....I could get through the interview, but i would be at 20% tops as far as being on top of my interview game... and I think I'm being generous...probably closer to the high single digit percentages.

There's a lot to prep for tomorrow's interview so I did pick up this am.  I got 3 OC 80's (the crushable ones...not the gel ones) and dosed 120mg's today to help with my prep.  It was a god send as far as the energy it gave me and the ability to concentrate on my prep...not to mention the confidence I did not have leading up to this interview.  

My plan is to dose the rest 120mgs tomorrow 1 hr before my interview on an empty stomach, chased by a cup of thick coffee, black.

4517,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,"This was brought up before and heavily debated on bluelight or opiophile in relation to another opiate, but the general consensus seemed to be that you'd have to drink GALLONS of tonic water to even get close to enough quinine. Tonic water is just too dilute.

There used to be higher dose quinine pills sold OTC in the USA for leg cramps, not sure if these are still available or not. 

Your best bet if you want to try this is finding a source for quinine pills online like a foreign pharmacy, or pure quinine powder(no idea on sources for either). Good luck, keep us updated!"

4519,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,No but Ive used quinine tablets for withdrawl muscle cramps and it really helps. The only drink Ive used for opiates is [grapefruit juice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9420451)
4520,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,I can't even find real Quinine water anymore.  Do you order it online?  The stuff they sell at the grocery stores contains barely any Quinine to be useful.
4521,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,"Modern tonic water contains considerably less quinine than it did in the past (when it was actually a malarial tonic). I’d imagine if it was as loaded with quinine as it used to be it would be unbearably bitter (unless you add plenty of Gin and limes!) so I’d assume that’s why. 

I think there’s something like 8mg of quinine per litre now, but that’s just off the top of my head and I’m almost certainly wrong so check it for yourself to find out exact numbers."
4522,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,The only opioid I've heard of people using Quinine to potentiate it's effects is Loperamide (Imodium).

Then tried another .5 grams to combine for a total of 2 grams, and I am chillin!!

Congrats on your taper so far!! Btw how as your taper? I tried going from 30 mg to 10 mg, and that was fine. Probably because I only dosed my 30 mg every 12 or 16 hours, well spread out, with sometimes only dosing 10 mg between each day until my next 30 mg dosage. I did that for a while, and it worked great. But then I had only 1 week of dosing 3-4x a day on 30mg, and my tolerance increased. 

So I decided I should try to taper just for a week or so to lower my tolerance. Going to 10 was fine, I did that for 5 days no problem at all. But when I tried going down to 0 mg, I still had bad stomach pains, restless legs, antsy behavior, anxiety. Not too bad though, but enough where I realized I was withdrawing.

So that's what led me to Kratom, and it's great so far. I would try doing 2-3 grams of Kratom"

4538,Used China white heroin (never used an opioid before) for the first time a couple weeks ago. It was super underwhelming. What went wrong?,"Heroin is a little strong for a first opiate. When I see non opiate users try it, all of the other side effects often overpower the good feeling. If you're looking for typical opiate euphoria I would try something weaker like hydrocodone or oxycodone (if you can be sure that you're taking real pills).  


But all that aside, I would suggest not getting to the point where you have a taste for opiates. If you tried them once and didn't see what the hype was about, GREAT. Go back to your life. You won't have much of one if you keep doing H."

4547,Really? Everyone here talks about how euphoric opiates feel. If they didn’t feel pleasurable then why would people do them? And I have sever depression so I figured I would have felt something strong.,"I was surprised too. I'd describe them more as being extremely numbing as opposed to euphoric. You can imagine why a numbing drug would be popular among people who have been dealt a bad hand in life. Also fentanyl is also known for being more sedating as opposed to feel-good. Stimulants, now that's real euphoria.

Speaking logically, the best advice you will ever get is to never take recreational opioids again. If you're absolutely determined to try a new drug, which I would advise against, ketamine is probably the best option in your case and has less life-ruining potential.

Drugs gave me that motivation to pop out of bed, go to work and do school etc. Everyone is different. (Currently in very early recovery)

I don’t know you. I don’t know your life, but the simple fact that you took time out of your day to seek help for this issue on reddit let’s me known you are not enjoying this lifestyle. 

If drugs are ruining your life, then stop doing drugs. Reach out for help, people on reddit won’t solve your problems, but we can help you understand the questions you ask.

Best of luck to you. Have a blessed day.","Concise reply!!  Definitely solid advice.  Could be\most likely other underlying issues to address, but in order to do that, you have to get clean.

4586,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,"It sounds to me like you got some other issues goin on.  Major depression? Or some other mental illness?  Or maybe your body isnt running right with some vitamin/mineral/hormone deficiency?

I could see if you just didn't do as much activities as you used to, but doing nothing but staying home 100% of a year only shooting dope and sleeping is a long fuckin time to do nothing.

You can't take the dog for a walk/ go for a walk in the park, or go out to eat, go see a movie?  Most of us Just don't have the extra cash to pay for movies or dinner out, but going for a walk or bike ride is free."
4587,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,It's a mix of depression and extreme reliance on the short chemical boost from dope.
4588,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,Yes. It happens with addiction. It doesn't mean depression. Its the drugs draining you.
4589,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,I imagine if I didn't have to come up with the cash to support my habit thats about all my life would consist of at this point. If you've really gotta get motivated for something just throw some meth into the mix
4590,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,"Addiction is only a small part of your equation. You clearly suffer from some kind of mental illness related to depression. The long term methods to turning your life around are the obvious ones, including exercise, proper sleep schedule, and social interaction. Obviously therapy, various blood tests, and likely medication are needed for you to recover. Now this is a huge double edged sword, but adderall might be beneficial for you in the SHORT term, IF you add it to the rest of what I mentioned. If you simply take adderall and do nothing else to improve your situation, within 6-9 months you'll just need adderall to feel the way you do now, and without it you'll feel even worse."
4591,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,"Sounds like the life, you have a boyfriend,  you have dope, lay around all day, no work, i do not see the issue :)"
4592,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,I do the exact same thing it sucks in bed forever constantly
4593,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,Just avoiding life 🤷‍♀️
4594,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,"Ok see the weird thing for me is if not for opiates I spend all day laying in bed going in and out of sleep.

Get some opiates in me and they act like stims, like an adderal, I have the motivation to get up and go.

&#x200B;

It was like that even before I started opiates, in fact thats why they gripped me so hard for more than a decade."

4596,Can you overdose on suboxone?,"If you have no opiate tolerance, yes.  Also a chance of overdosing if you mix with benzos."
4597,"Hi again guys, subutex, suboxone or methadone?","Suboxone if you were on weaker opiates (oxy, codeine, hydro, etc) and methadone for H or Fent, maybe even oxy depending on dose."
4598,"Hi again guys, subutex, suboxone or methadone?","It all depends on what else you have going on along with addiction. Like myself I have chronic pain so my choice is gonna be straight towards methadone. I've had both, methadone is an effective pain med and for myself it didnt give the the craving effect like other opiates have. The only thing I'd say to warn people of is be prepared to either get on it then get off as quickly as possible if you dont want to be dependent on a drug, if your gonna do the long haul make sure you are gonna be able to get this script for as long as you want/need it. Most say that you'll never lose a prescription as long as you abide by the guidelines, dont abuse it sell it whatever it would be to cause you to loose it. I know otherwise. Drug policies changing every day getting stricter made it impossible to continue methadone after 13 years of an unblemished script history when my doctor retired. I simply could not afford what the few doctors that prescribed methadone were wanting. Second thing is be prepared to loose your teeth. Theses meds dry your mouth out so bad it is unavoidable, so be prepared to be very proactive on dental care."

4609,Why does heroin make life less boring?,"This is a somewhat philosophical question that deserves some philosophical pondering. I believe it falls directly in line with Lao Tzu and his “Tao Te Ching” explaining Taoism (Daoism)

“We mould clay into a pot,
but it is the emptiness inside
that makes the vessel useful.”

— Lao Tsu, Tao Te Ching quotes 11

Essentially - it’s not what a life “contains” that matters...it’s the creation and process of setting up the kind of life that is what is meaningful to the individual. Further, it’s how you create your experience and why you do it that makes it worth it (or not worth it).

So in your experience, you are creating a life that allows you to feel good about doing nothing. But if you did nothing without scoring, it would not be the life you want, and thus the boredom is palpable. When you score you know that you are giving yourself the confines of what you want, so whatever happens inside those confines, boredom, is much more acceptable to you and your mind.

A look into this can be seen as following:

However important it is, non-being cannot exist without the being.  A pot cannot be a pot without the clay.  A house cannot be a house without the pillars and walls. Money cannot play the role or exchange if cannot be recognised as a tool of trust.


Just a thought.


Not to mention...H dulls senses, emotions, fears, anxieties, etc. thus doing nothing feels like doing something, when high.

4667,"Idt you can just say “anyone who is breathing to little is automatically overdosed”
Thats just not true lol","But isn't there a difference between overdoses? An overdose is simply when you dose a little too much, it can go from breathing a little less to stopping breathing completely. Or am I completely wrong?"

Ive used all forms of opiates for comin up on a decade and my girl used to sit up and tweak just listening to me sleep... I would apparently take one GASPING desperate breath every 45 seconds and slept like this multiple nights a week depending on how hard i went...

But every day I woke up rested and felt normal as fuck. Ive never once overdosed in my entire career as a dopefiend.

I used a lot of speed when I was younger. Honestly I never found it that recreational, I only used it for energy, concentration, motivation. Plus it was cheap enough to use everyday when I was still in school. It's euphoric, but different to oxy. It's worth a try I guess, but just note that if you rely on speed for energy/concentration regularly, it'll fuck up your sober energy and concentration levels."

4700,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,I wouldn't worry too much. Here in the US I can tell you that all of the treatment places ive been usually use one main medication to taper you off opiates whether it be oxys or dope you were using. This is usually some sort of suboxen or methadone. They usually add additional meds to help with anxiety and stuff. I have gone through the same exact treatment when I initially had a pill problem and when I became full blown IV dope user. What changed was the starting dosage of whichever tapering drug (methadone or subs) the facility would be using. Typically when you start the treatment process you will be dosed accordingly until your discomfort fades away. All you need to do is be vocal about how your withdraw symptoms are.. It really dosent matter pills or heroin. Best of luck.
4701,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,"Oxycodone does not show up under opiates, and heroin would test positive for opiates, they won't do just a standard 5 panel.. urine analysis kits have been around for so long, it's easy for any institution to choose a urine test that tells them what they need to know, or possibly test your blood, but they don't cater it to you that specifically, as stated above, u will get either Methadone, max they can give you is 30mg to start out, probably be more realistically 20/25mg, or Suboxone (Buprenorphine, and Nalaxone) 8mg\2mg, 
      If you are worried about them telling anyone else about your drug use, don't HIPPA protects your right to Privacy, unless you are considered a threat to yourself, or another person, in that case they are obligated t to say something. 
   The main reason they will drug test you is to make sure you in fact test positive for one opioid substance or another, since Methadone, and Buprenorphine are both powerful medications, they don't want to take the liability of giving a non opioid tolerant person a dose of either as it could be potentially very dangerous and even life threatening! 
   I've been in both programs several x and am very familiar with the process that take place in either the methadone clinic, and at a Suboxone Dr... Sounds like in your case you are more than likely going to b given Suboxone... Ns if you have any experience with it, but it's a lil strip, or a tablet you place under your tongue and let fully dissolve, I personally hate Suboxone, but there are others who swear by it, that said, they both do work to alleviate all w\d symptoms by 2nd day several hrs after 2nd dose.
    They will also in either case make sure you are in active withdraw b4 they give you either med as well, it's easy enough to fake this part if you had to, just look up all the symptoms of opioid use disorder ""post acute withdraw symptoms"" or PAWS, and memorize... A Dr will ask u a series of questions, the goal is to basically say you are currently experiencing as many symptoms on that list as possible 👍 how that helps you understand what is likely going to happen going forward in either case, good luck!"
4702,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,Tell them about the dope because if you don’t get any comfort meds it’s gonna be extremely hard to stop.
4703,Tell them about the dope because if you don’t get any comfort meds it’s gonna be extremely hard to stop.,"What ""comfort meds"" are you thinking they will give besides methadone or buprenorphine, definitely no Benzo as these programs are getting extremely strict as far as putting anyone on Either Bupe and benzos, or m\done and benzos, they might give you an otc non-stimulant stool softener, Buspirone for anxiety, Seroquel for help sleeping and really I don't see much of any other comfort meds being used that isn't otc garbage, or shit meds rx'd to you basically no one in the program will want to take.

So I’ve basically been paying for both his stash and mine, and his is twice the size! Haha. But he will deny deny deny even if I were to show him a damn video of it. He would try and come up with some bogus answer haha."
4744,Where could it have gone?,"Your boy definitely took it. If you cut it open then it wouldn't matter if it was already opened previously, it would still only open where you cut it at if it was either glued or melted back together, as long as he did a decent job of gluing or melting it"

4762,Who uses “make-up” to hide scabs and track marks?,Just a thought... But they make that special cover up for tattoos. Although I havent had the opportunity to test it out I would be it would cover up track marks well.
4763,Who uses “make-up” to hide scabs and track marks?,"Hey! A good option if you’re really committed to hiding the track marks is to first apply a green color corrector. That will neutralize the dark marks. You can apply it with your fingers and kind of buff, or blend, it in. Then go over that with concealer that matches your skin tone. Again you can use your fingers for that. If you really want it to last you can buy powder to set it with."
4764,Who uses “make-up” to hide scabs and track marks?,"I never IV’d, but learning how to do my own makeup years ago has been awesome in general (as a dude.) Everything from under-eye circles to scars are gone if I want. Great for looking fresh on little to no sleep."

I'm a girl and I have a hard time finding the right color foundation because I have freckles, but I went into an Ulta store (sephora or the like would work) and they have samples of the concealers out so you can try them and find the right shade.

4767,Is it safe to chug a beer or two on suboxone?,I think its fine. But idk honestly
4768,Is it safe to chug a beer or two on suboxone?,"A couple things to consider—

Buprenorphine is metabolized by the liver, so your liver health and overall drinking history and habits are worth considering.

The main concern with buprenorphine and alcohol is respiratory depression, where tolerance and dosing and bupe’s long half-life come into play, along with other factors (especially any other meds or supplements that could contribute.)

The biggest issue I see is....Natty Ice? You may want to see a professional on that one ;)

Edit — in another thread you said you’re almost nodding? If your tolerance is that low to bupe at the moment, I would not push it with alcohol. Being on subs long-term versus recreationally makes a big difference with respiratory depression."

I thought id never get off tea.litterally dident think it possible. Know i eat a ounce of kratom a day for pain and am on benzos. Both help immensely but ive stopped both for weeks though never in tandem. And benzos only when i had pills. Dont just go pick up. A mean benzo habbit. Tougher than smack.

4791,"Generally same mg if subutex is peachy/pink football. 8mg.

I'm simply wondering if I'm reading this wrong. It appears that it really does include 8% more bupe than the brand name strips. The subutex tablets I have access to are white and perfectly round."
4792,8/2mg Brand Name Suboxone vs. 8mg Generic Subutex: They Aren't the Same Dosage?,"ilucki think generics need to be within 20% of name brand to get an fda approval so they may just throw the extra 8% in to make sure they are on par.

Good luck. I got some tablets just 6 when i was getting off and i ddent like them but it prob had to do with not waiting long enough and putfing myself in precipitated wd.

They can be +/- 10% of the peak plasma level achieved by the name brand. So in theory, two generics could differ by as much as 20% in terms of peak plasma level, but can only differ by a maximum of \~4-5% in terms of active ingredient.

4802,Panic attacks?,"Hey dude, this could possibly a reaction to anything that your dope is cut with. Maybe some Strange new/old fent analogue or smth else. it could be literally everything.

 If you dont send your dope to any testing company then you never will know. It is also highly possible that with a new batch the panic attacks will be gone. Or in the worst case scenario cause no one says a thing your dboy uses more of the cut that is causing this and it gets worse. 

If I were you, I would talk about it with your dboy. Just be nice and friendly and tell him whats happening with you and your body. Give him a feedback. Otherwise he wont will know about that issue. I know that many customers are afraid to tell their dboy that their dope is shit but if you dont do it he wont will know it and wont do shit about it. 

Maybe he already gets his dope cut Like this. Then he has to make the same conversation with his dealer like you need to do with him. 

So the best advice is to a) send it in and get it checked (IDK about the USA but in my country its a free service or b) talk to your dealer which may be uncomfortablw but at least you will know two things ftom talking with him. 1) If he cares about his quality and 2) if he cares about his customers. I wish you the best of luck and if you want to know my opinion the best choice would be to talk to him."

4824,Will three days get me past the worst of it?,"It will help absolutely. You will most likely feel some residual affects of WD, but some of that is unavoidable and it's minor compared to what you would/could have felt.

4826,Will three days get me past the worst of it?,"I’d conserve and save that sub for when ever you truly fucking need it and can’t take it anymore.  And no point should you feel 100% normal or comfortable because if so then you’ve taken too much. Wait as long as you can and take half a mg. Should keep you ok for 12ish or more hours but I’d wait like 24 before taking another half. But who’s really say what you’ll experience. They’re a so many variables in these situations. Your tolerance, how long you’ve used, how much suboxone you’ve ever used, how you respond to suboxone. Take me for example, if I was seriously going through it and had been using dope continuously for some time that 3/4 isn’t gonna do much except maybe keep me from shitting my pants, I’d still be a miserable useless sweaty anxious mess. Good luck"

4841,How much IV heroin for my first time?,Just snort it. IVing new white heroin is an EASY way to die from fentanyl
4842,How much IV heroin for my first time?,"Really I would just stick to snorting it at least until you've built up a bit of a tolerance if I were you

But if you absolutely have to bang it, snort a match tip size bump first just to gage how good it is, then go from there. If it's awful or decent or in between do 1/4 a point (a point is 0.1g), if it's amazing do 1/8 a point.

4849,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,Hahahah fr opana is the shit
4850,Hahahah fr opana is the shit,"I wouldn’t call them shit, but  i definitely like oxy WAY more"
4851,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,Gotta hit the right dosage for your tolerance and it is bliss plus energy. At least for me. Oxycodone is the shit. If you’re looking for true bliss/euphoria in a pill then you need opana my friend! Oxymorphone is the best drug I have tried. Well opiates at least. My heart and mind still love mdma and lsd. Especially together. Morphine is boring. Dilaudid is alright. That’s hydromorphone. Look for those pandas duder.
4852,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,"Dilaudid fucking sucks ass, but opana is amazing so if you can get some you need to jump on that as quickly as humanly possible"
4853,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,Apparently everyone is different. Oxymorphone for me is even more energizing than oxycodone and it doesn't put me to sleep like hydromorphone and hydrocodone do. It's euphoric for sure but I can never nod from it and it doesn't feel like noddy heaven right before bed like the hydros do. A puff of weed helps give it a noddy edge but sometimes it takes away from the euphoria.
4854,Tomorrow bright and early I’m finally tapering. I will be going down from 48 mg a day to 30mg. Then in two weeks down to 24mg. And stabilize at 24mg for a while. What can I expect? Also doctor put me on suboxone so it’ll be my first time taking suboxone instead of subutex,"How long have you been on 48mg per day?  There should be no difference from subutex and suboxone for you, unless you’re shooting it.  Even then many people say there is no difference whatsoever.  At over 32mg, I’m not sure of the side effects of the naloxone to be honest.  Most docs script under 32.  
 
The buprenorphine itself actually presents a higher binding affinity than naloxone does under normal conditions.  When people get PWD (precip withdrawal, after taking subs too soon following use of full agonists) it’s not the naloxone causing it, it’s the high affinity of the bupe.  It kicks other opioids off receptors, and doesn’t allow you to get “high” (at least not easily)

I imagine you’ll be just fine with the taper.  You can always ask for minor adjustments as needed; maybe even ask your prescribing physician for a direct(ish) number to call if your symptoms are too bad - if you feel lucky.  Maybe even ask to stay on subutex and do the taper if it makes you more comfortable.  You can always warm yourself up to it beforehand by taking bits and pieces less each day until your taper appt. 

Then you’ll even have some emergency milligrams to spare :p"

That is a very high dose and for many people the pain does not start until you get down to doses of 2mg and lower.

Good luck to you!  Once you get down to lower doses and if you feel any side effects, ask your doctor for some comfort meds during the end of your taper (if the goal is tapering to 0).

4869,How do I snort without it going down my throat?,"Why would you snort suboxone? The membranes in the nose that absorb it are pretty much the same as the ones under your tongue and considering sub strips are made to be administered sublingual you’re just wasting product, especially if it’s going down your throat (there’s no way to prevent drip considering it’s your body’s purposeful reaction to a foreign intruder) The effects will come on in the same amount of time if you snort it as it would if it was taken sublingual; Anything about better bioavailability is not true. Just take it as directed, there’s no reason not to. They were designed with addicts in mind, none of you guys are pulling wool over your psychiatrists eyes"

Everyone just kept saying I was gonna die so I freaked kinda but I also have nothing to live for so I was just gonna listen to music and go to sleep and go peacefully.  I think it’s been a couple hours since the xans. It was light outside when I did. Not tryna offend anyone I just don’t value my life but I’m more scared of dying painfully than anything.

I’m alive rn (10:47pm) and not even too high anymore so I guess I’ll be good. I wanna finish this last bit of dope up but at this point Id be playing Russian roulette lol

I wouldn’t advise it to anyone. But snorting the xans is a waste too anyways if you do that.
4907,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,I’ve seen a friend do it many a times.
4908,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,"In order, I snorted half of 1mg xr Xanax I had crushed from a few nights ago, popped a whole 1mg xr Xanax pill, then snorted a few small lines of dope."
4909,"In order, I snorted half of 1mg xr Xanax I had crushed from a few nights ago, popped a whole 1mg xr Xanax pill, then snorted a few small lines of dope.",Why would you do that? It doesn’t pass the mucous membrane to begin with and it has a ton of fillers. You can’t snort most benzos. What you feel is from the drip.

4911,Xanax is a oil pretty sure some would cross no ?,Defs seen cunts IV them but they had black dead fingers from it
4912,Xanax is a oil pretty sure some would cross no ?,No. He had a 1mg pill he split in half. That’s .5mg out of the hundreds of mg of binder and filler that aren’t water soluble either. That’s waste and nothing more
4913,No. He had a 1mg pill he split in half. That’s .5mg out of the hundreds of mg of binder and filler that aren’t water soluble either. That’s waste and nothing more,What if you wheel filtered it

 Then there’s one other Water Soluble but I’m not sure if it’s in the USA. Can’t remember the name. Of course unless you run across a Vial and can IV/Inter-muscular. 

I know several that Snort benzos, but they say straight up, it goes straight to my throat.

4919,It doesn’t. It’s not water soluble it cannot be snorted. Your guy is having a placebo and getting high on the drip.,"shhhh... Yes, Op.  it gets u wrecked bro just keep snorting them!  don't even eat any.  dope works best if you mix it with honey mustard and spread it on your kneecaps for 15 minutes, too"

4923,Why does suboxone give me an amphetamine like high?,Same it's fucked do you IV it by ant chance
4924,Same it's fucked do you IV it by ant chance,"Nah I dont IV it, I'm always scerred I'll fuck it up and damage a vein or something. Plus my parents are super nosey and they'd find out eventually cuz I'm an everyday user. I just mix it in a tad of water and put it in a nasal spray bottle, I'll mix like 20 subs in a bottle and keep it handy"
4925,Why does suboxone give me an amphetamine like high?,Do you take any other opiates as a rule or only just the sub? Many opiates give you that energetic feeling with focus. If you don't have a tolerance and take a small dose (generally) you get that feeling bigtime and it lasts a long time. I usually do 4mg at a time twice a day and get that feeling within an hour of taking it. It's not as pronounced a feeling compared to when I'm totally sober and do a sub though.

4929,Why does suboxone give me an amphetamine like high?,"I used to get that energized euphoric high from any opiates. It eventually went away with amounts and time using increased. I have never even understood why everyone wants to ""nod""? To me that's just a waste of good drugs! Anyway to each is there own! Enjoy it any way you can, and no do not mix subs with any opiate..."
4930,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,I dont think so
4931,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,"The rule with subs is generally less is more. I'd take 1/4 of it or a half just to save money and get more doses out of it. If I'm taking my first dose of the day, I can't tell a difference between 4mg and 8mg. I haven't been on subs long but long enough to have made that out."
4932,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,It won't if you stick at that dose. Anything above 12-16 (at once) mg IMO is a waste. Your milage may vary
4933,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,Don't snort it just put it under your tongue. You get the exact same effect that way without the possibility of losing some that you get with snorting it
4934,Is it safe to do coke and subs at the same time?,It's as safe as combining 2 highly potent addictive substances can be. Which is not much. But as long as you keep it in reason I would not expect much harm.
4935,Is it safe to do coke and subs at the same time?,"Nothing like a speedball. 

You're better off waiting until the coke is gone to take any sub"

4944,What's everyone's opinion on Ibogaine for recovery?,"I believe it to be majority ineffective, although some people seem to like it. I think it also has a “mystique” associated with it that it’s some kind of suppressed medicine, as another poster called it, and that western medicine just hasn’t caught up. In reality I think a lot of it is snake like used to bilk desperate people out of 10k in Central and South America for a quick psychedelic fix to their problems. There are going to be people who very vehemently disagree. I’ve known 3 people who have done it in real life and all of them relapsed. But hey, I think we should do some studies and decriminalize it and see if it helps. Maybe there is a process that needs to be followed through in order for it to be effective. I want to believe!"

4949,"Dealer arrested, is my phone # hot?",I wouldn’t worry about it. Plenty of my dealers have been busted over the years and I’ve never been arrested for anything related to heroin.
4950,"Dealer arrested, is my phone # hot?","Cops don't bust a dealer, then downgrade to small time users, they might try and flip him for info on his supplier, but cops try to find the next guy up the ladder, not climb down the food-chain"

Finally a guy answered the phone and I said thank god im withdrawing so bad I need to come see you now. That guy on the other end of the phone wasnt my dealer he was indeed a cop, he replied “your dealer is face down on his floor dead as a door knob so please stop calling we’re trying to clean up this mess.”  Lol and nothing ever came of it so I think you should be good."

4956,Most effective way to dose suboxone?,Intranasally is higher than sublingually
4957,Most effective way to dose suboxone?,"I wouldn’t even try to inject films like that unless you have micron syringe filters and experience using such a small amount of water to dissolve one. 

I’d just use it sublingually. You could try and dissolve it and use a nasal spray bottle to use it intranasally, but again you would need to be so careful about the amount of water you used for it to be worth it."

4959,Gotcha. What do you mean careful btw? Like be careful not to use too much water?,"Exactly, nasal sprayers are effective in how they distribute/deliver the water nasally, but they only deliver tiny amounts of at once, so you’d have to spray it more and more depending on how much water you use to dissolve the strip. And that’s all just to get one strip up your nose. 

A brand new, full bottle of Afrin nasal spray, for example, is 15mL so you’d want to use far less than that for it to make practical sense."
4960,Most effective way to dose suboxone?,"wut? Nothing and I mean nothing completely bypasses the liver. Maybe first pass, but that's it. 

Put them under your tongue.  They're made to be used that way. Their bioavailibility is high sublingually then putting it in your nose. 

If you don't have an opioid tolerance then shit the best way would be to shoot them, then you'll get 100% bioavailibility instead of the 95% or whatever it is sublingual."

Insufflation has I believe in the 60 to 75 % range when done correctly and a lot of people do it wrong. 

The strips are purposely made for sublingual, and I haven't check the percentage,  but usually when they're made a specific way, they have an extremely high BA that way.

Let me check and come back with an edit, specifically for subs.

Edit: well fuck me running.  It's got a very very poor absorption rate sublingually. 30 to 55% is what all the clincal data reports.  

I was wrong. Apologies. I'd figure the formula would be much better sublingually."

4964,Can you get high off vicodin?,"If you have to ask, then I guess you'll never know. My suggestion is you toss them. If you can't figure out how to get high off opioids then you should probably just flush them."

4966,Are you kidding?,uhhh no
4967,Can you get high off vicodin?,"Yes you can get high on Vicodin, that has been my drug of choice for 5 years. Youre going to need about 30-50mgs though, 20 didnt even touch me when i first started using. Also, alcohol takes away from the effect of the Vicodin, so I'd recommend not drinking until about 3 hours after youve hit your peak"
4968,Can you get high off vicodin?,What whiskey do you drink? I love opiates and whiskey
4969,Can you get high off vicodin?,30mg hydro is around 20mg oxy. 20mg hydro is around  ~13.3mg oxy which wouldn't get me high even without tolerance. So yes you can. But you shouldn't be liek that and start using google.

But you shouldn't be liek that and start using google.,Really??!! Even with a tolerance I definitely at least feel something something off even 10 mg of oxy. With no tolerance I’ve seen some people nod out off of 10 mg of oxy. It’s more of a person to person basis in my opinion

4978,M box 30's pressed with heroin?,"As said above, most likely a fent analogue, buckets of the stuff available sadly. Fast becoming a cutting agent which I find a disgrace to the opioid world.

4983,if I never got sick and had and endless supply of money I'd never want to get clean.,"If I had a replicator like off star trek, that could magically replicate any opiate or duplicate any substance, yeah I probably would not quit.  I'd just make sure to keep huge stashes squirreled away in various locations.

But for now I want to quit as my tolerance is just so high.  I don't get high any more, infact I feel mostly sick in minor withdrawals most of the time. I'm tired of being always cold, low energy etc.  I had much more energy, drive, and motivation when I was clean.   Even with an infinite stash of opiates I'd probably just waste my life getting high and doing nothing, but at least with a stash like that you wouldn't have to worry about chasing dope."
4984,Who wants to be clean?,"I'm OFF all opiates. I'm off all methamphetamine.  I'm off all benzos. I'm literally off everything.  I'm 30. I never expected to live pass 27. I always expect to be a static because that's all that I've ever felt I was worth.

I've realized, I'm worth more. I don't want to go back. I don't want to be involved anymore. I've picked up so many felonies this year. I think I had a total of 14 felony charges, 4 of 5 Misdemeanors, and I was still getting stopped by cops.

I've settled some of the stuff,  but I don't want to give up my life to jail. I don't want to stay in the cycle.  

Sure, if there was no social, emotional or physical impact upon myself,  others and the police. I'd get high every single day for the rest of my life, but there are consequences and I'm done with them.

5005,Has anyone ever recorded themselves high?,I make pictures of myself after I used. Writing on the pics how much I used etc. and strangley I just look nearly exactly the same like when I just woke up. The only difference are my eyes of course and  that I am also often a bit pale. But otherwise I look semi normal and not disgusting. But maybe its the ROA too since I aniff my dope and dont shoot it. But the few times I shot my dope I looked like I was serious ill and about to die. But if I record myself while nodding it looks very strange and disgusting thats true. Oh and one time I recorded myself while on some xans and dope that was awful disgusting.

Oh, but when I'm hitting him I can't talk bc if I ever try to in order to give him a taste of his own medicine he'll throw an absolute bitch fit temper tantrum and tell me he's gonna take all of my shit regardless of if I miss on him or not.

He's recorded me a couple times too and I absolutely could not fucking stand what I saw in the video either, but I usually don't get high when I do my shit bc I like to be able to stretch it out so that I don't have to be sick as much.

I've definitely done a number of ""talk to the camera/camera phone"" bike rides while on dope. I probably have those videos since I don't say anything incriminating in those videos.

I wonder.....

Usually if I was doing that, I was more ""energetic"" as opposed to nodding out. Such videos often happened while riding my bicycle to work but I've done it on days off.

5065,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,I cut a strip and fold it backwards to itself so both sides are facing out and put it in my mouth between my gums and lip . Kinda like chewing tobacco. That got me lit I nodded out found it on the floor the next day and put it back in my mouth and got loaded again lol but I was also on OC 80’s at the time so I had a lot in the old system...
5066,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,Yea depending on the brand (Mylan) and if it’s not a gel patch you can cut up the strips into small pieces and put under your tongue.  It will get you blown but be careful obviously bc it can cause overdose.  I wouldn’t recommend it ever but It feels like heaven.

5070,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,My first 100/ug h patch i cut about a fifth of and put it on my cheek. I woke up tasting the dirtyass carpet. Dont know how close i came to oding and dieing but it was more than i could handle at the time. Dident recall a buzz just finally getten to try these to realizing i was in the middle of the floor unconcious for an hour. Home alone gf had finally left to see her mom. Took all of 15 seconds from saying bye to playing with the patch. Prob on the floor 15 minutes after. All in all glad she dident find me the next day dead on the flooor...she would have killed me lol

(No idea why) none of us seriously got hurt, one of them did have welts on his head tho. I was wearing a white hoodie, and the next morning it was completely green and brown. 

Our sober friend had no idea we were serious for the first 5 mins, and he wasn’t trying to break us 3 up when we were on bars. Lol. But yeah people get aggressive on bars"

5081,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,To the best of my knowledge weight doesn't effect opiate tolerance at all but my advice would always be to start at a low dose. You can always take more if you don't reach the desired effect you're looking for.
5082,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,10-15 is sufficient for a first timer

5097,Smoke or chew fent patch??,Fentanyl has in general a short half life. So there wont be any difference between chewing or smoking. But smoking them is a bit safer cause it is possible that the fent isnt everywhere the same mcg amount on the patch. For example if you got a 100mcg patch there could be in one corner 40mcg and in the other just 10mcg. And for chewing you mostly cut the patch in pieces and then you could chew on the 40mcg or the 10 mcg piece so its more likely to OD. So I would rather smoke it than chew on it.

5106,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,"Now think of the opposite of that and you have withdrawals:

Going to work with just a dose of codeine to tide you by as you try a taper.  I'm freezing cold yet the children at the school I work at, are all running around in t-shirts.  

The environment is so loud, the lights so bright. Every little noise makes me twitch and jump. I sit in my chair in my office, and look at all the helpdesk tickets I've ignored. Work is piling up yet I am too dead to get out of my chair.

I spend my day in work in my office, by my heater, reading reddit. Kids are fighting outside my office (which is in a main coridoor).  I wish for them to go away.

I come home, to find my parents are pissed off with me as they have found some of my codeine 60's. ""You're taking those tablets again"" they say.  As if I can just stop taking them, throw them out, no worries at all."

I loved that vinegar smell and taste, the ritual, everything aswell as the high. i was hooked from the start. i would go out and chill in my van at 4:30 am or so when the world was still asleep and the sun was just about to start rising, on this particular day i went out there, (it was parked in my driveway, its like those vans you see ""vanlifers"" living in with carpet and a couch, recliners and a chest table in there, the passenger seat spun around and id go out there early in the morning, a rainy day on this particular day, and i plugged my gamecube into the outlet in there and ran an extension chord from my house to my van. id then sit out there as the rain hit the roof, in my cozy suburban driveway in the PNW, playing my favorite old games, getting super nostalgic about my childhood, and smoking tar. this was back before i got big into fent and tar would actually get me high. id take a little BB sized ball and smoke that over the course of maybe 20 min and actually be nodding out. ahhh, so nostalgic. then id have my boys come over once they woke up around 9 and wed drive to the river, open the doors facing the beautiful view of the columbia river, and hotbox with weed and crack beers while id smoke a few more hits here and there throughout the day.

First few lines of dilaudid were godly too, zonked for a solid 90 min best body high ever

Been blowing my bank pretty much chasing it ever since, sometimes I get close but it's never worth it."
5121,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,"It was around the year 2000 , there was a foot of snow outside and I was sitting by the fire. I had discovered opiates and The Lord of the Rings. I think that was probably the zenith of childhood before the jarring cusp of reality and adulthood. I’m very happy now, but if I was forced to choose to relive one moment over and over again - it would probably be around there. I’m definitely romanticizing it in my head as things were not all good at that time, but it was before opiates kicked my ass and forced me to realize just how life altering they can be."

Yikes!!
The main thing that I had/have to have when I get up, is drive energyand motivation. That was the main thing I was gonna miss and a reason not to quit. 
When I told the sub dr that and told him that sometimes I could fall asleep standing. I work on elevators so that a big fuck no. He put me on adderall 60mg/ day and that got me back in the game. I’m not naive. It’s probably not something a recovering drug addict should be able to get there hands on but whatever I’ve been on them legally for 1.5yrs and fuck yea,  Ive been known to take the last 3 2weeks before my refill is available. But I’m a fuck up when it comes to drugs so what do ya expect. I’m not banging dope in my arms. But one thing at a time"

5129,Would taking kratom while withdrawing from suboxone pro long how long I withdrawal for?,Short answer is yes. Long answer is its worth it.

5132,So I can fully get thru the suboxone withdrawals while on kratom then after a week or 2 I'll just have to deal with kratom withdrawals?,Yeah pretty much. I'd go at least 2 weeks. Bc sub wds are brutally long. Taper the kratom and the wd will be mild.

5140,Will kratom get me high?,It may get you a small buzz. It may help kill some pain. But kratom is not a drug in the sense its gonna get you happily loaded. Too much and the wobbles make you wanna throw up very nasty powder . i take an ounce a day. I dont love it. Im better off with it. And i ussually wish i had a real drug.

Safe to take 20mg oxy?,"Yes alcohol and opiates are very synergistic and potentiate each other. This is a multiplicative effect, not an additive. So you could be in danger mixing them. If you have opiate tolerance you should be perfectly fine assuming you drank ur last drink 3 hrs ago.

Edit: benzos, dxm and dph, promethazine and other antihistamines potentiate opiates. Would not at all recommend using benzos for this purpose but I do it whenever i have opiates anyways. Very dangerous"

When I had strep throat i got a bottle of codeine and promethazine i drank the whole thing and had a great time lol with not much tolerance. I think it was over 200 mg of codeine. I bet you'd get a nice buzz from 90-120mg of codeine. Codeine is semi synthetic while tramadol is fully sysnthic if that makes a difference. Plus tramadol messes with your serotonin too"

Depends.

Tramadol **can** be amazing recreationally. Really. But not for everyone. Some people swear to god that Tramadol gives them a oxy like high (without tolerance obviously) ans some people don't feel it at all."
5212,Tramadol...worth it recreationally?,"Tramadol and codeine. Each to their own I'm afraid. Try them and see.

Tramadol does shit all for me, and I'm prone to seizures so whenever I use it to bridge buprenorphine gaps I never go above 100mg per day. I've never got high from it. Sadly that's all my parents get now. No more unlimited codeine, then dihydrocodeine, then morphine, then fentanyl patches. Just Tramadol. 

Same with dihydrocodeine, on its own, I have never gotten high from it. Just a huge histamine reaction.

Now codeine is another story. I am an extremely efficient metaboliser so 32 hours off Subutex 300mg of codeine will give me a good buzz.

I have found codeine and dihydrocodeine to have good synergy for me. I find adding 200/300mg dihydrocodeine to the same codeine dose enhances the buzz, warmth and duration of the experience. I find with standard hayfever OTC anti-histamines it will dramatically reduce the histamine reaction.

Try everything you can in small doses to see what fits you. Each of us has a unique biochemistry and neurochemistry so each and every drug will affect each of us differently."
5213,Anybody else tired of clogging the toilet EVERY DAMN TIME from opi shits?,"I've punished many a toilet in my hay-days of using... I notice Methadone tends to clog toilets the most for myself.  Lol, definitely a satisfying scenario when u r finally free of a 6lb block o waste 😒"
5214,Anybody else tired of clogging the toilet EVERY DAMN TIME from opi shits?,"I smell you. I have an old lady living below me and when my toilet gets blocked she gets annoyed at me.  It's embarrassing. I don't even put tissue down there anymore and have to be sure to cut em up if they're too big... My neighbour seems to have trouble telling me though, which probably inconveniences her more than it does me seeing as I tend to smell the issue after she does. I mean absolutely, she shouldn't have to smell my shit, but she has to tell me there's an issue for me to be able to sort it out. I think she's nervous of me or something but still she could leave a note or put one through my letterbox. 

I find it's best to start by holding a large bucket of water about chest height then pouring it all at once into the bowl, that usually will dislodge stuff due to the pressure. Failing that some sort of acid designed for the problem. Can get strong sulphuric acid here which dissolves pretty much anything alive or dead, for now at least. That always does the trick but I'm not sure how good it is for the pipes or environment (not to mention my relations with my neighbour), so I try to make this a last resort."

I personally prefer doses that don’t make you nod, but the occasional nod can be nice if you have nothing to do.
If someone’s breathing gets really shallow or stops and they are unresponsive is where things get dangerous. Some people also asphyxiate if they nod in a position that blocks their breathing fyi, so if you’re concerned about someone but they are not in any obvious danger just lay em back so they aren’t slumped over straining their breathing"

5279,According to google the nalaxone only has about an hour of effectiveness? So if as long as i wait over an hour atlesast if and when I do OPIODS I know I wont feel it all cause the bupe but you will still feel it right?,"what? feel what? still feel what? the high? no. its not the naloxone blocking it, at all. its the bupe. it has a higher binding affinity than naloxone, the nalox is mainly an abuse deterrent and for patent purposes"
5280,"what? feel what? still feel what? the high? no. its not the naloxone blocking it, at all. its the bupe. it has a higher binding affinity than naloxone, the nalox is mainly an abuse deterrent and for patent purposes",Higher binding affinity=Can you explain this in dummy terms?
5281,Higher binding affinity=Can you explain this in dummy terms?,"okay.. you have a trampoline, 10 kids are jumping on it. theres a magnet inside the trampoline - this is the opiate receptors inside your brain. 9 of your kiddos have magnets stuck to their shoes (these guys are your bupe), forcing them to bind tightly to the trampoline aka opiate receptors. 1 kid is jumping alongside them but has no magnets on his shoes, hes the naloxone. so he doesnt bind to the trampoline (brain) because hes so overpowered by the other force with the higher binding affinity, therefore this kid is negligible and isnt even in the magnet to have an impact. hes just kinda there. mainly for patent purposes, and for abuse deterrent (naloxone taken sublingually has nearly 0% BA anyway, but shot up it has  different affect which they try to steer ppl from doing)

does this make sense?"

5284,"Yah naloxone isn't the blocker. Its reverses the symptoms of an overdose but doesn't ""block"" opiates. Buprenorphine does","In theory it is a blocker. But it has a short half life, and bupe has an even stronger binding affinity, so it's irrelevant when combined in mediations like suboxone. But if you could dose naloxone every hour, it would efficitvely block many opoids."

It's the buprinorphine that blocks any other opiate high, and that lasts at least 24 hours."

So if as long as i wait over an hour atlesast if and when I do OPIODS I know I wont feel it all cause the bupe but you will still feel it right?,It’s possible to fall back into the overdose because of the half life.

5292,[deleted],Appreciated lots! Really hope this turns out fine and all. Thank you 💜
5293,Appreciated lots! Really hope this turns out fine and all. Thank you 💜,[deleted]
5294,[deleted],Even with only a 40 mg tolerance? Damn dude this is gonna suck pretty bad then. I appreciate the help though
5295,[deleted],Also tolerance only 2 weeks 40 mg for sure
5296,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,I used it after tapering off oxy I used for more than 20 yrs.  I used the Kratom for 8 months.  It helped a lot.  It effects people differently.  I don’t get any euphoria from it like I’ve heard others experience.

I don’t get any euphoria from it like I’ve heard others experience.,I don't think anyone will get euphoria from kratom after 20 years of oxycodone use
5298,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,If you have a heavy habit then it won’t do much
5299,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,"I don't get any euphoria, but find it extremely helpful for symptoms like bone and joint pain, restless legs, and anxiety."
5300,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,"Depends on your habit.  I was a very VERY heavy H user and tried Kratom for WDs a few times.  I always took copious quantities and it never produced a high, but it gave me some relief (again, in massive quantities) for an hour or few.  Really depends on your tolerance and habit.

One of my dealers was actually one of the early Kratom distributors in the US so I used to get it for free when I requested it when I was copping.  That dude ended up paying an undercover agent a kilo of blow to kill his business partner, though, so that connect dried up fast."
5301,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,"Once you’ve got a habit it gets you good enough to go to work, that’s about it. I’d honestly take gabapentin over it. But gaba + Kratom and I’m pretty legit, can enjoy family and friends."
5302,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,why not just do an actual proper taper instead of this shit seriously??
5303,why not just do an actual proper taper instead of this shit seriously??,Cause I tried and I suck at tapering
5304,Cause I tried and I suck at tapering,tell me how you tried and failed? like what did you do specifically?
5305,why not just do an actual proper taper instead of this shit seriously??,I dont have any help either its just me myseld and I
5306,I dont have any help either its just me myseld and I,you yourself and you plus real opioids to try and detox bupe is even worse than just you yourself and you :/
5307,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,I got off bupe using kratom and had no withdrawals but now I'm addicted to kratom. Might work if you could actually quit after a week or two
5308,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,Yeah. I did this it worked for me but I didn’t use over a week. I got a gram and just rode it out. Took the edge off and used as little as possible tooting bumps until I was out.
5309,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,If your an addict it would be very hard not to develop another habit using this method.  I suggest getting some gabapentin really takes away withdrawal without starting another opiate habit.
5310,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,"Yes.  I could never get thru the bupe detox even at 1mg a day. I always used dope for while then detoxed from the dope. Even though the low dose bupe detox isnt as intense (id say it was like 50-60% intensity as a good dope habit detox) i just couldnt take the 2-3+ weeks of it.  Ive actually never known anyone to take subs longer than a week then taper off em n stay clean. In almost 20 years of using idk anyone to do it.  

My one sub doctor actually quit taking new patients for subs becsuse in like 8 years of prescribing subs he never had someone taper down and jump off them. He trulywanted to help people and every sub patient either failed drug tests or quit going when tapered down to 2-4mg"

I’m curious if you have ever looked into dissociatives for pain(ketamine, pcp or RC dissos) imo they are incredible for pain and can slow opioid tolerance if you use them together. They can be difficult to use and function if you aren’t experienced but I reckon they would be great just to switch things up every now and then cuz they actually stop you from feeling pain, rather than stop you from caring about the pain like opioids, and they don’t produce physical dependence.

Just food for thought cuz I know some people use 3ho-pcp and 3meo-pcp for pain."

You'd likely just throw up everywhere, or even worse you'd 75% pass out, then throw up, and slowly choke on your vomit whilst almost fully aware of what's happening, but be unable to do anything about it.

5318,Is OD’ing painless?,"It probably depends on the amount you took. People who have survived OD'ing have described it as being pretty horrific. Going in and out of consciousness but being aware that you aren't breathing. I've experienced something pretty close to that. At the same time I have friends who have died with the needle still in their hand so I imagine they went pretty quickly without even realizing it was happening.

Oddly specific. Yes. I know.

There’s also a chance you’ll wake up being hit with narcan by EMS or in a hospital. Then you’ll have precipitated W/D for a while.

The vomiting was so intense it was the only time I've ever been scared for my life."
5337,Is OD’ing painless?,100% painless and not scary at all. It's actually kind of a bummer coming back to reality.
5338,Is OD’ing painless?,"It’s painless.  If you wake up, you won’t even remember it happening.  I’ve had tons of overdoses and multiple clinical deaths.

Problem with ODs, though, is they’re very rarely fatal.  Something like only 3% are fatal.  The rest of the time you wake up and when you have a severe OD and wake up, the results are often awful.

One time I woke up and my left arm didn’t work for three days, I was lucky I didn’t lose the arm.  Another time it was my left leg.  The leg went out for four days and would twitch and stomp whenever I put weight on it.  Again, lucky I didn’t lose the leg.

Even worse, I’ve lost use of parts of my face and head before too.  One time, the entire left side of my face went essentially dead.  It was hard as hell to open my eye and when I did, it was extremely painful and tears would flood down my face.  I also had no feeling in the top half of my head which was an extremely weird and oddly uncomfortable situation.

I do NOT recommend an OD and if you’re asking this because you’re considering it, reach out for help and find someone who cares and can assist you.  If you’re an addict, I know it can be hard to find such a person, but people do care about you.  If you legit don’t know anyone, fucking message me.  I’ve been there and it sucks, but your life is worth so much more."

One moment he was snorting a crushed pill and he said it felt stronger than he was used to and the next he was throwing up in the sink with me supporting his entire body weight many hours after. I was lucky to be able to keep him breathing. No recollection of not breathing and turning purple, no recollection of the repeated sternum rubs, no recollection of anything. I was lucky to have been able to keep him breathing and awake. Hospital was only an option if I couldn’t do that. I’ve never been so sore or exhausted. It was hours of walking while supporting a full grown mans body weight and giving pain stimulus to keep him going. Everyone else I’ve talked to says they just black out and come to with the paramedics.

The painful part was being narcanned honestly. I was narcanned twice by my boyfriend. Instantly I felt insanely nauseous, extremely cold and claustrophobic as hell. Felt like everything was closing in. I couldn’t walk and had a hard time talking or typing (I was trying to look up OD’ing symptoms of heroin and couldn’t spell for the life of me). I was made suddenly aware of my breathing which was incredibly shallow and chaotic. One second I was breathing very slowly and the next I was gasping for air. It was the shittiest I’ve ever felt in my entire life, so shitty that it’s turned me off of heroin altogether. It was traumatic in more ways than one. If it weren’t for being narcanned, I can honestly say that I probably would’ve just died without ever having known nor felt a thing."
5349,Is OD’ing painless?,"Yes, as long as you don’t wake up"
5350,Is OD’ing painless?,"Read on the bocthed US executions. 20 minutes of hell whilst the muscle relaxant slowly chokes you but doesn't allow you to show it and the chemicals burning around your pulmonary system.

Apart from anything else if it contains acetaminaphin that's a three-day slow death from liver failure.

Closest I've come is from alprazolam and not noticing a kitchen cabinet door was open. Hit it front on, broke my wrist on the way down and hit the back of my head on the floor. An inch or so from a countertop which would have killed me.

I still have the hollow on my forehead from the haematoma.

Whatever it is, it's not worth it. Take it from a dude who was in screaming agony for 7 years, no one believed me and I was taking 800mg codeine and 12 grammes of ibuprofen every day for years.

Two surgeries later, yes I'm out of work, but I have a family who support me, a wife you'd do anything for me and the buprenorphine keeps the beast at bay. Never getting off them just gone back up to 8mg from 6mg this week as I couldn't take the drop.

My wife works with those waiting for a heart and/or lung transplants who'd kill for what you have now. If you OD your organs are trash."

One mate was on 2 mls for nearly 6 months and finally jumped off.
Still had crap WDs that lasted weeks.

I think my max dose will be 60 ml. 
So if I go down 5ml every like, two weeks or so, I’ll still be extremely uncomfortable? I wouldn’t rush off of it.. and I’d go down as slowly as possible.. I’d still have bad withdrawals?

And are the success rates low because it’s addictive its self?"

For first few weeks you do go to the doc 3 tines a week and if you give 8 weeks clean your put on the local GP who tests randomly,some dont bother and give you 4 weeks of scripts.  And i think its just cheaper to keep people on it. 
Its very addictive and dangerous to people with low tolerance.
60 mls would kill lots of people. In on 65 and its the fear of WDs that stalls most  from getting off.
If your on it not too long and do it with doctors help it can be done.
Its not impossible so dont let me scare you into not doing whats best.
Most people i know are 15-20 years on Heroin and then methadone.

5404,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"I have tried tapentadol a few times as well as tramadol. I do not like tramadol at all, because of the serotonin effects and weak MOR agonism. It's the only opioid I will always refuse, so far. I found tapentadol a completely different beast and very pleasurable. Stronger and much more of a proper mu opioid agonist than tramadol.

It was warmer than tramadol (and more potent) but my tolerance was high enough at that point that I didn’t get very high from them."
5407,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"That’s Nucynta homie.  It’s sort of like Tramadol, but stronger and a lot less side effects (and risk of side effects).  It’s strength is around that of Vicodin I believe, might want to double check that, but it produces a high most similar to a weak Oxycodone.

I’d say go wild.  They can be fun, especially if you have a low tolerance or fuck mostly with pills (e.g., if you’re a Perc or Vic user mostly you should be able to get a hit out of em)."

You know, I’m not sure. I’d like to say I’d keep my wits and do what I currently believe to be the right thing.

I’d like to say I’d do what’s right for the overall human satisfaction or continuity but it’s not something I can accurately say. I’m not in that position yet.

I do opiates when I have them from the pharmacy. I have 3 herniated discs and a tumor located on my spine. The pain is unbearable most days and opiates are a significant help to me.

5516,Has the whole banning flavored juice affected you at all?  How do you feel about them trying to ban it outright?,"Absolutely, flavored and menthol juice was banned here in michigan and it was easily 60% of our sales. There are ways around it but i lost thousands in inventory already. A lot of shops are buying bulk flavorless ejuice, as well as nicotine and flavor shots sold separately, customer combines it themselves. I worry that if i invest in doing sales this way, the governor will just end up banning that as well. I am willing to bet in 6 months when they ""review"" the ban that we will be able to get juice again but it will be FDA approved, and they will tax the shit out of it just like cigs. We don't make anything in cigarettes, it all goes to the state. I personally think it is about money, not health. If it was they would ban alcohol and real cigs too. Also think the timing is weird seeing as marlboro just bought 38% of juul and the ceo of Marlboro is now the ceo of juul."

5591,How many times per day do you dose? HALP ME BE NORMEL,So what is the end goal here? Do you want to get off completely or just cut down a lot. It seems like you are using a fuck ton of times a day. If you are trying to taper I would definitely start cutting out two times of use a week. So you use before you leave for work. Don’t do that anymore cut that one out too. Also cut out using after the 10 am meeting. If you only want to cut out one time a week that would take much longer though. So how about you cut out two times each for the first three weeks then the next two weeks only cut out one use and you will end up using when you wake up and when you go to sleep. Or just cut one more out and you will use three times a day just in case you start to feel sick halfway thru your workday. Hope this helps.

I have no self control... all I want to do is feel cozy so I can be happy and forget about work...,Yeah I’m pretty bad at spacing my shit out so I’m the last one who should be giving advice lol. But just try your best and do what ya can. Good luck.
5594,Yeah I’m pretty bad at spacing my shit out so I’m the last one who should be giving advice lol. But just try your best and do what ya can. Good luck.,"Haha, nahh you're the first one who should be giving out advice, just following it is the hard part."
5595,So what is the end goal here? Do you want to get off completely or just cut down a lot. It seems like you are using a fuck ton of times a day. If you are trying to taper I would definitely start cutting out two times of use a week. So you use before you leave for work. Don’t do that anymore cut that one out too. Also cut out using after the 10 am meeting. If you only want to cut out one time a week that would take much longer though. So how about you cut out two times each for the first three weeks then the next two weeks only cut out one use and you will end up using when you wake up and when you go to sleep. Or just cut one more out and you will use three times a day just in case you start to feel sick halfway thru your workday. Hope this helps.,If I relapse. I will try my best to do this.
5596,How many times per day do you dose? HALP ME BE NORMEL,"I do once when I wake up (which is like anywhere between 2-7pm), once 2-4hrs after that, once between 10pm-1am (my biggest shot of the day usually), once again 1 or 2hrs after that, and once more at like 4-6am."

I'm always way too high at work. Falling asleep 1 minute into a meeting while standing up, nearly falling sometimes. Sometimes I'm nodded off then have one of those falling sensations, then I scare the shit out of everyone when I jolt awake in my chair. The worst was when I was in a Skype call with the IT guy and was sharing my screen, then he asked me to type some code into the console and it was just ""ipconfiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii"" and he didnt say anything for few seconds so I kept nodding off. That last one was just easy to blamed lag or the keyboard being broken. Lol.

Unfortunately I'm no longer a secret addict since my parents found the needles. They're the only people I wish never knew. I don't care if the rest of the world knows. I just feel so bad letting them down.

Anyways. I'm aiming to cut down a lot! I will only do small doses for sleep and waking, and mainly reserve my doses for when I do stuff like write music or skateboard or draw or make retarded squirrel viddos."

5612,Are new heroin users being made a lot these days? are they young? do they go str8 to heroin/fent instead of pills?,"Yes, your assumptions are pretty much correct, although the rate of new H addicts has declined due to the prevalence of OD's in the media and all the stigma that Heroin carries these days (excessive if you ask me, not referring to Fentanyl of course). I think as doctors prescribe less and less, the number of new Opioid addicts will level off.

There are still approximately 1.5 Million Opioid addicts in the US as opposed to 400-500K before the Opioid epidemic created so many new & young ones, so the market will still be bigger than it has been in a long time (probably ever) but thankfully teens have less of a chance to be exposed through pills that flooded the illicit market like 10 years ago.

Of course things can change or even reverse in a decade or possibly even less time, but for the next 5 years or so it seems like the illicit Opioid user group will be pretty stable. One thing is for sure, the illicit Opium and refined Opioid industry has certainly grown and earned a lot of poor farmers and others a lot of our money - there are many new people getting involved in the business as they see others benefiting from it, whether it's a peasant farmer in Mexico or a cartel associate refining a Kilogram."

That’s how I came to be a heroin user (age range 18-22) but I’ve been an addict of Vicodin and percs since I was 14. It really all varies.

Infact out of my 20 or so circle of friends, one ended up straight on Heroin from other drugs like weed/coke -  I was the nerdy one who started off CWEing codeine then progressed to darkweb oxy.

Over here weed is the common drug, then cocaine. Also party drugs like MDMA.  Nobody uses Heroin or other opiates, other than the stereotype of the homeless H addict.

I left some oxy 40's in my office in work, the cleaners tidied my office and just left them on my desk. The boss came in and left a note on my desk about work, ignored the pills.  Nobody here even knows what oxy is. They were just generic painkillers to them. Here, ""illegal drugs"" are a powder or a plant.

But here we don't have the culture of kids ""lets raid our moms medicine cabinet bro lets get high as fuck dude"".  I know I'm hypocritical as fuck for saying it  but a lot of Americans seem to get stuck at the mental age of 14 years old."
5621,Are new heroin users being made a lot these days? are they young? do they go str8 to heroin/fent instead of pills?,"So here's what happened with me, started experimenting with pain pills at 18 but it never really became an ""addiction"" because of the scarcity. Tried heroin for the first time at 21 only because it was much easier to find and much cheaper too, and it became an ""addiction"" very quickly for that very reason. I'd imagine it would be the same for many young people. Most 18 year old kids aren't just going to experiment with heroin for the hell of it. But if they try pills first, they already know what to expect and the concept of heroin becomes way less scary.

I couldn't imagine going through a full blown pill addiction phase. Waaay too expensive. I've known people who had perc habits that cost hundreds of dollars a day"

Obv that’s just my experience and from what I’ve seen I’m the few. I’ve seen a few kids that are wild and will take anything and everything offered to them, few of them tried the wrong shit and ended up with addictions but for the most part they’ll still start with pills"

5648,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"Being there for an addict is important FOR THE ADDICT. It's not important for you.

You owe him nothing.

Let me say this again  -- YOU OWE HIM NOTHING. 

Those people saying how great you are for being there with him through it all?

Uh, they're not there with him through anything. They are saying how great you are but it's not something they would ever do and so it's just words. They just think it's great it's not them having to deal with it. 

And you DO NOT have to deal with it. Again -- you owe him NOTHING. 

You owe yourself the best things you can do for yourself. Fuck what anyone else says and fuck what he says.

Put yourself first.

Be there for yourself.  

Break up with this guy.

That is literally the best thing you can do for you, and you are the only person you should be concerned with right now.  Take care of you and forget this boyfriend. Whatever happens to him is on him and him alone.

This situation and this guy are making you miserable.   You deserve to be happy. End the relationship and move on!"

I think so. You sounded like you were shaming her.

What about him? What does he have to do with you? Just because he is a dick doesn't mean you aren't.

No, it's not.  None of it is. It sounds totally judgmental.

Here's your post:

>So obvious--yet she actually needed to be told this so that she could finally move on to find a decent husband for herself--and a decent father for her future kids.

>Wake up, woman!

>which seems to be a necessary wake-up call, because she's apparently willing to put up with anything...

You think that sounds supportive? ""So obvious""?! ""She ACTUALLY needed to be told this""?! 

You ACTUALLY think that sounds supportive?

It doesn't. 

It's not a ""wake-up call"" and it's not ""necessary."" It counterproductive and abusive. If you truly believe you sound supportive  -- and you may not; you may just be a passive-aggressive abuser -- you have absolutely no idea what the word ""supportive"" means."
5653,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"I'll throw in my 2c having been in similar situations. I think most people are correct in that leaving him and moving on will be your best bet. One is that he will probably always choose the drug before you. Two is that you're not his caretaker, it is not your duty or obligation to make sure he's safe, okay, whatever. And third, is even if he gets clean (which I doubt you've ever known him while truly clean), he may not even be the same guy you fell in love with. Drugs change who you are and how you act. When I'm clean I'm completely different from when I'm using*. And honestly, I had much better luck dating when I used heavily. More chatty, better mood, more calm and relaxed, less libido so not nervous around partners, etc. When I'm sober I'm a completely different person than that. Especially if he's using to self-medicate, finding the drugs that make him feel ""well"" might be a longer process than you're willing to stick with.

All and all, you're young, barely an adult really. You don't need to waste your time trying to save a junkie who doesn't want to fix himself. You deserve better and you shouldn't get caught up in the sunk-cost fallacy of thinking all this time will be a waste if you leave. Holding his hand can be just as harmful as leaving him outright, really depends. Bottom line is he won't get clean for you, for his mother, for his future kids, for anyone other than himself. No addict will. So let him figure it out and if he becomes a man you can love then maybe you can let him back in your life."
5654,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"you’re so so young, get away from this guy and never look back, hate to say it but he’s bad news, got no business w someone so young either. you don’t need this stress or the bullshit that goes along with it. ditch him and never look back before he pulls you into this black vortex of a lifestyle. he’s already hurt you enough. you don’t need this shit. I mean look, his bullshit has already driven you to drink to cope. stick with him and you’re even more susceptible to picking up heroin."
5655,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"honestly just reading all this made me exhausted, i dont know how you can put up with it. heroin addiction apart, he sounds like an asshole and you know it. addicts need support, but not from anyone. he needs professional help, not yours. he's dragging you down. you already know you should leave him, and he'll probably try to do some emotional blackmail to win you back. whatever happens to him after you break up is not your fault. if he was really trying to recover and be better you'd know. if he's really interested then he would do it  for himself and you can offer your friendship during this process if you still care for him anyway. then when he's good enough to be in a relationship you can reevaluate yours. with heroin involved you'll never be the main relationship. that's my advice as a recovering heroin addict"
5656,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"I really don’t see any reason why you should stay with this person; it sounds like he’s taking advantage of you, and it doesn’t sound like it’s really ever been good. It seems like you’re in the beginning of college? A lot of couples break up just bc they want to be single for college, with no serious problems (like their significant other being a heroin addict) even present in the relationship. “You the reason I wasn’t single in college!” might be big Sean lyrics but I have literally heard this said in real life as a weird insult / guilt trip.. just shows people regret that shit. I’m all for relationships but this one just seems problematic, and aside from the obvious problems everyone else is already going to point out, I just wanted to highlight that you’re at an important stage in your life. During college, you have school and your social life to focus on; if you add in a problematic relationship, you’re not going to have time for all three. These could be the best years of your life (they were for me, I’m not just repeating an annoying cliche)... don’t waste them on someone who is more focused on heroin than you anyway."
5657,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"Definitely leave the dude and dont look back. I dated a girl a lot like you (well, given the limited info I have about you) the first time I started to get strung out. That was 10 years ago, long enough that it shouldn't matter to me any more (certainly doesn't matter to her I'm sure), and I still wish I'd just broken up with her or just never started dating her to begin with. She was this bright light of happiness, genuine care for others and sweetness unlike anyone I'd ever met. I watched myself dim that light over the course of a year and didn't even realize it until a year after she dumped me finally. I've never stopped regretting it and still feel I haven't redeemed myself from it, probably never will. I cant/dont want to imagine what was going on in her head during that time. It makes my head hurt and stomach roll over. Unless you want to be dimmed too, definitely leave this dude."
5658,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"First off, I'm very sorry about your situation. I'm actually a recovering addict with almost six years of clean time, and I'm still trying to fix the relationships I destroyed. If he's already injecting it then he's not going to ever get clean until he truly hits bottom and wants to change. You're young, and it sounds like you love him. My advice to you is to tell him that he needs to get clean and sober, or you're going to leave him. I'm sure my advice sounds harsh, but I do know that I've hurt so many people when I was using drugs. I'm not a liar, and I'm not a thief. But I was both of those things when I needed another fix to prevent going into withdrawal. I've seen so many people who ruined not only their own lives, but the lives of their loved ones as well. So, I guess it comes down to how much you truly love him. I wish you the best and I hope he chooses you and his family over death and destruction."
5659,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,Run...seriously he has a long path to travel to have any chance of getting togeather and he may never.  You need to love from a distance so he doesn't drag you down with him.

5661,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"Get as far away from this guy as possible. You’re a freshman in college with your whole life in front of you. He’s a grown man dating a child (I assume you were having sex with him before you were 18) and crashing in her dorm room because he has no where else to stay. No judgement here (on you, but definitely on him) but you have to run. He’s in the midst of active addiction, where many of us have been. He needs a lot more help than you can give him."
5662,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,Wait why is a 24 year old dating someone who turned 18 while they were dating. Little bit predatory.
5663,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,Move on. Don’t let this guy drag your life down. I know he probably seems worldly or some other bullshit - don’t let him fuck your life up. You can do better. He is living in your dorm without a job injecting heroin. Come one. Wake up!

How is that hard to understand. Keep it up and you'll find out what real misery is. Like this is the situation you read about on this sub from the dudes perspective where its a thinly veiled brag about how much of a stud they are for leading some naive fool on into supporting their ridiculous habit. Most of the time cheating the whole time; only ever showing remorse because they got caught and lost their free meal ticket. Also if you want a relationship to work, little psa but forcing someone to give up everything they love for you isnt a good way to endear yourself."

It won't put you back in Day 1 so you have to do it all over again (that is a myth - or tapers would never work)  - but it will set you back enough you'll regret it.

5722,Avoid sweating massively when on opiates?,Also the sweating is caused a combo of our temperature regulation being fucked because thats just what opiates do and also I assume slight withdrawal caused by the drug leaving your body when your busy doing other things the only way to stop it is to stop doing oxy Im pretty sure
5723,Avoid sweating massively when on opiates?,"Don't let people get to you, sometimes you'll see a post like this and nobody will say anything about your dosage. And other times everybody decides to jump on you. If you wanna try going cold Turkey then that's what you should try doing. If it doesn't work out, I wish you the best of luck on the subs. Anyway back to your question. I found this with a pretty quick Google search. Maybe try some Benadryl?

""Opioids: Opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone and Dilaudid are a well-known cause of excessive sweating. Why? Opioids stimulate a type of immune cell known as mast cells that release histamine, the same chemical involved in inflammation, and that in turn leads to sweating."" Jul 31, 2018"
5724,Avoid sweating massively when on opiates?,"I cold turkeyed 4mg of sub a day for 2-3 years for 6 weeks before I relapsed out of boredom and because I started smoking weed again. It's totally possible to cold turkey a hard habit if you've got real will power. Most NPCs here on reddit will tell you ya have to go to rehab for 90 days and it's literally impossible on your own, but that aint true. Ive cold turkeyed many hard habits, xanax, massive kratom habit, suboxone, oxy, etc. It's not that hard if you're actually determined to stop."

5734,Anybody else have nightmares?,"Not whilst using, but the first night of withdrawal when I actually got some sleep, I would have some crazy intense , super dark dreams."
5735,Anybody else have nightmares?,"I almost never remember my dreams. But I usually know if they were pleasant or not as I'm waking up. So I can say yes, I have definitely been having some sort of unpleasant dreams a lot lately."
5736,Anybody else have nightmares?,I've had sleep paralysis and night terrors ever since I spent a bunch of time in the hospital watching my daughter's body give up. After the first week or so staying in that room since her mother wouldn't/couldn't it started to really fuck me up. Enough dope puts me out enough if I do dream I sure as hell don't remember it.
5737,Anybody else have nightmares?,"No, but I have dreams that I’ll find a stash of oxy and be pretty bummed when I wake up."
5738,Anybody else have nightmares?,"Yeah man, at my peak usage I was having nightmares daily. It was torture. I’ll never forget it. They went away after I quit."
5739,Anybody else have nightmares?,Yes. I got nightmares from Heroin especially. When I smoked/snorted it and slept that night I got a guaranteed nightmare.

5744,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,My suggestion is to just leave him be. Clearly if trying to talk to him only upsets you are not going to reason with someone in WD. He is miserable and misery loves company. I mean from what you are saying this is only his behavior during WD. Why even bring it up if it only lasts a few days.

Ultimately what’s the point in dating if you don’t have some sort of thought about a future together, and unfortunately it’s usually next to impossible to change somebody you love that’s in active addiction. Wether realizing it or not, you are inevitably going to come second always, I just hope you figure this out on your own without needing to be stung first. Just my opinion though!"
5749,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,"Honestly, don’t try talking to him about anything serious, or having any prolonged discussions, while he’s in withdrawal.  Withdrawal completely fucks with your mental state and brain chemistry so he’ll be in rare form and likely won’t be able to convey any real feelings, just artificial anger and depression.

Save the serious shit for when he’s dried out.  During withdrawal, keep things superficial and short.  I know that when I’m in withdrawal, it’s hard for me to even hold a superficial conversation and I often get pissed off just having to engage with people for any prolonged period of time."

5751,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,Limit interaction with him.  Wait for him to initiate contact if possible.  Don't put up with any bullshit abusive treatment though.  Just because he's miserable doesn't give him the right to lash out at you for nothing.

5763,"Any reason why they won’t potentiate? because what I’ve read and heard is that antihistamines potentiate opiates hence the promethazine in lean. 

Cheers mate ❤️","They don't ""potentiate"" what they do is make you more sleepy and it makes you nod off more easily. But it's not a technical potentiator. Technically potentiaters fight for the same enzymes in your body, which makes your blood plasma level of the medication go up. What you're talking about is more polypharmacy sedation.
Edit...cant type"
5764,"Any reason why they won’t potentiate? because what I’ve read and heard is that antihistamines potentiate opiates hence the promethazine in lean. 

Cheers mate ❤️","They do not potentiate in the pharmacological sense. A true potentiator inhibits or induces the livers enzymatic system in one way or another. E.g the typical one grapefruit juice (white being best for furanocourmarins) which affects the P450 cytochromes of 3a4 and 2d6, these are the most common for metabolising opioids etc.

Antihistamines can have a synergy, where for example your morphine (enzymatically produced from the Codeine) is made more sedating accompanied with Promethazine etc. Personally finding synergy in combinations is far more common and usually results in great results. My favourite being gabapentoids with Opioids.

Hope this helps!"

Pain meds from a doctor would be quite cheap with insurance (maybe $10 to fill a prescription of generic brand, depending on one’s insurance). dealers usually sell at around .75 cents to upwards of $1 per mg (so $30 for a 30mg roxy). Yes it’s insane."

I had bronchitis and the Dr gave me hydrocodone cough syrup. I didn't read the directions and took an entire measuring cup like you would when you take NyQuil or dimetapp. I just remember a warmth come over me while listening to music on my walkman. I do remember distinctly music never sounding so good."

5790,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,"You can get somewhat close to that original high, but, as I’ve discovered, it takes months of sobriety and your tolerance never really flattens out again.

Another big contributor is the current state of the Heroin supply out there.  When I started out sniffing dope at 13, shit was pure authentic good ol fashioned dog food.  Nowadays, most shit is Fent or a random Fentalogue and those range from “not quite as good of a high” to “what the fuck is this strange sensation”.

I have relapsed a few times in the last few weeks.  Prior to that, I was clean for I think close to 50 something days.  Now, if I get good old fashioned dog food and I blow a bag or two, I’ll get damn close to that first high.  I’m also not sure if that first high was as good as my memory made it out to be, it was my first time feeling that great so, like sex, I may have just built it up in my mind.

Just my two cents, but it comes from 15+ years experience doing just about every Opiate out there (I’ve done OCs, OPs, Roxies, Pandas, Vics, Percs, Tramadol, Heroin, U-47700, Carfentanil, Fentanyl, etc.)."

Same with opioids. Kinda off topic drug wise. But whenever I did blow with people I sometimes wrapped it up in some tissue or toilet paper and swallowed it with my drink. I love snorting.

Oxy. I dont really like codeine, as it only give me sedation with no euphoria. Tramadol gives me a lot of euphoria, but I also get jittery, sweaty and etc. So I usually just take them as prescribed.

Every time is like the first time & I've been using (low doses) for 15 years now.  Hydro/oxycodone, codeine, kratom, dihydrocodeine... whatever pills I can get.  They all give me a nice hypomanic energy in low doses that makes me over the moon.  

I think abusing anything will make it less effective.  Basic law of tolerance.  This is why people 'chase the dragon' for years in search of that first high but it's never to be found again.  For me, weed has been the most dramatic in this regard.  No high from ANY substance will ever be as powerful & amazing as my first weed high.  Now it just makes me anxious & paranoid :\"

5808,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,"This isn't a fact whatsoever. If someone uses the same exact dose say once every 4-12 weeks, and get this, actually follows through on only using once every 4-12 weeks, they can easily use for a decade or more without their tolerance going up all that much. I used to use just 20mg hydrocodone or 15mg oxycodone once every 4 weeks on average of \~8-9 months per year like clockwork for roughly \~6-8 years, before I eventually found access to cheap international darknet opium and ultimately obliterated my tolerance and started using daily/near-daily. It's only once you use near-daily or at least 1-2x per week for months or years, particularly in high doses, that you tend to develop permanent or pseudo-permanent tolerance."
5809,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,Abstain for a year or two then bang a Dilly or two. That will do the trick. It won't be as good as the first time but it will probably be very remarkable.

5812,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,"Its all about whether you have opiates in your body or not. If you use daily then there's just always some opiates on your brains receptors but if you wait a week therell be none on your receptors.

Going from 0 to 100 is more noticeable and more intense than going from 50 to 100.  That's why when you are sick you feel it really good but if you already used recently its not as much of a change.  I always felt like the first use after a week or more felt just as good as a first time use"
5813,Methadone & Clonidine ?,"I can't answer for methadone in particular because I don't take it, But clonidine does not really potentiate opiates, it just makes you sleepier and more likely to nod off because it tanks your blood pressure. It's really useful for withdrawals but not really as a potentiator. Maybe somebody will come on here and correct me but no...it would not be worth taking with an opiate and possibly dangerous. And no they would not test for it on a your ua. It's a very commonly prescribed blood pressure medicine"

I’m on about 120 mg of oxy Ir a day and if I get an impaction, i literally do not have the strength to get it out.

The MOD team can't see who is doing it, but the admin team can. I have communicated with the admin team about it in the past but there isn't much they can do and this has been an issue for a long, long, long time. You are right. Someone is very petty and has some unreasonable vendetta against me. That's all I can imagine in regards to it.

>Also, I decided to take it upon myself and upvoated all of those comments that were zeros or in the negative because fuck whoever is doing this to you!

I typically don't let it get me down and still participate a lot here. It can be upsetting though when I have something important to say and it gets buried. I also think there's a ""voting mentality"" where if people see a few downvotes they jump on the bandwagon and contribute to it by downvoting, and if people see a few upvotes they contribute to it by upvoting...

I don't know, but it is what it is, if anything can be learned from it, you get farther in life when you're respectful of others. I'm a huge believer in Karma. I've been through a lot. Some of it has been self-inflicted and I take responsibility for that. However, it seems I've got a lot of good karma headed my way.

When people are treated like the bottom of the barrel, sometimes they react by wanting to feel like there’s someone beneath them too. (Could be in part a control issue here). I’m not excusing this behavior or condoning it by any means, simply trying to examine where the hate is coming from. I also think it’s entirely displaced anger since we cannot always get mad at those who put us down or fight back against the loved ones who think little of us so we come onto Reddit and unload here. You also make a good point about how often times anonymity makes it easier for us to be much more hateful when you do not have to suffer any consequences for your actions since no one knows your name and you don’t risk losing  any kind of reputation. There is also the fact that drug addiction itself is tiring and hardening. I have experienced people’s wrath simply bc they were WDing and obviously bitter about it and needed a proverbial punching bag.

I agree. Getting a downvote isn't mean. It's normal!

However: 

>What has been happening to me is no matter what I say there are a few trolls up and ready to downvote me from the getgo. I may sound crazy, it's been going on for years.

During the high of the drug it makes people nasty.  I didn't realize it until i got off them.  I though i was just naturally an asshole and had bad luck, but most of it was the opioids.

when i take them now (not dependent), i get nasty while high on them.  I feel great, but i treat others like trash."

But yes, it is absolutely correct that there could be an analogue that is not tested by the strip in your dope. I am not very well versed in anything beyond test strips as far as guaranteeing the lack of fentanyl, though. But honestly if your dope has no legs it's more than likely fent or an analogue. I got a batch of fentanyl dope a few months back and I couldn't fucking enjoy it because I swear to God by the time I was finished sniffing the shit it was out of my system lol.

5948,What's everyones opinion on the most effective way to do multiple times!?!,"Best way possible, get a 3ml-5ml oral syringe (doesn’t matter which kind), put the dry cottons all in the barrel, draw up 30-40 units of water so they are nice and submerged, and leave half the plunger down for room and shake it for a minute or so. Then simply squeeze the solution into ur spoon (this way you can squeeze every last bit) and I recommend wheel filtering for any cotton shots. However if it’s within 12-16 hours you shouldn’t get sick. Never seen anybody else make up cottons like my method before, and when I was still using I showed tons of people. Hope this helps."

You can attempt to manage pain with OTC tools, but if that doesn’t work and you decide to use what was prescribed, you should be fine taking one or half a pill.

There should be very little Euphoria if any at all. You may get some relaxation,  which will help your recovery. Good luck!!"

I was more content, I felt good.   A few days later I remembered this being odd and researched codeine.

Pandoras box was opened and now my tolerance is 480mg of oxycodone a day. plus dihydrocodeine, and tramadol.    Literally off that 60mg dose. I remember it like it was yesterday."

So it was definitely a hard situation to be in.",I can relate to this so much. Girl I was in love with once hid her use from me for a long time. I discovered tracks one day. It lead to me thinking that it was all my fault. And inevitably we ended up using together cause I was too weak to say no. The relationship ended horribly and we don't speak anymore. Took some time to get over it all due to some circumstances that were out of my control.
5997,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"I think it's 100% up to you to be honest, or you dont have to be, but at that point what's the point of being with someone you can't trust and share your life with...? 
Maybe initially I wouldn't bring it up on the first date, but I've never lied about my use to my long time girlfriend. She inspires me to do better. I look up to her because she's growing as a person and it makes me want to change. I started using fairly young, myself and was lucky enough to have a supportive family/girl who I can trust.

I've felt guilty about letting her ""party too hard"" but at the same time accept responsibility to the fact that I am the source of these party favours and it's up to me to keep her safe if I'm doing anything w her. You have plenty of options, good luck homie."
5998,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"**Start getting shit done and it won't matter!** I'm a decade into this. First just weed and pills for five years and then suddenly im doing oxy and banging street dope for another five, grew weed and did crime to feed my habit(not in the US, Im European), but you know how it goes.... I met a girl, and she got me straight.... No, not sober. She is though.  But I promised that I will never ever again commit a crime that harms another person physically or financially. She's tried to make me quit several times, but it never works for long. My longest is a month. This just seems to be how Im wired (I know its because my brain is fucked up from all the dope, spare me). So anyway I'm still doing drugs whats my point here? My point is, that is it really your addiction thats stopping you, or is the addiction just an excuse for you to not do anything else. because the dope helps you not care about what a loser you are? Really ask yourself. Why are you not doing anything with your life? is it because all your time is spent chasing drugs and shooting up? Well that is straight up bullshit. I am just now finishing a college god damn degree, from a good school no less, right now and I am a stone cold crazy speedballin' junkieman, and if I can do it, anyone else can. You will feel better about yourself and your life once you start getting things done! You'll rely less on drugs, and maybe eventually reach some kind of stability? Maybe start slow and just go outside for walks or something each day, get a shit job or something, just do something *besides* dope.

Your girlfriend will love you for it. And if she really does love you, she will be angry with you and there will be fights, but she won't leave as long as you try. Once you stop trying they're gone, man. You can have a good relationship with someone who does not use, as long as you put in the same effort they do but thats just every relationship. If one person isn't putting in any effort in that relationship it is DOA.  You also don't lie about your use constantly. You can never lie about it really, you have to be as honest as possible. Just tell them that you're noddy because you did H not because you're sleepy, just fucking say it. They will be mad but telling them is far better than lying and building up that poisonous doubt. If you are doing things in your life that are not just drugs then you might just be fine. My relationship works because my girl understands that i have serious anxiety issues that have to be treated some way, and the medical system has fucked me over so bad i refuse to see a doctor and so i ""self-medicate"". I also have pains from various injuries and a bad back. So she knows about the opiates and the benzos and has tried to get me to quit but she has kind of given up. I mean, i cause no trouble, I am always good to her, and I work my ass off both at work and school, do my absolute best to at least appear sorta normal around her and she appreciates that. However, sometimes I just splurge and will be a mess, but If all I did was lay around and shoot dope like i did before i met her... she would leave immediately.

So sometimes i choose and embrace the dirty junkie that i am, and at others i try to focus on more productive things, like higher learning. See, i think this is the problem and one huge mistake, an assumption that people make that you can only be either or. You're either a dirtbag do nothing junkie, or you hold down a decent job and have a functioning life with a wife devoid of anything that might accidentally be pleasurable. Me, i happen to have accomplished something inbetween as far as it seems, though its likely that i will die of some sort of overdose at a young age, i do combinations of huge doses of stuff that should kill me, like at least oxy 180mg crushed, some ketamine, alotta benzoz and at least a handle of whiskey, all at the same time which is mostly why my gf hates what i do, but she understands why and where its coming from, and thats just the best thing. And i respect her respecting me, by never ever doing that shit around her. Maybe that's the secret to our relationship really? idk. but if ur person doesn't like you getting high, don't get high in their presence.

But god damn stop making excuses, if you're the kind to just lay around. The only reason you haven't done something is because you haven't put the effort in, life's hard for everybody so buckle up bucko and earn that speedball at the end of the week. Think of your drug ""problem"" thats keeping you down instead more of as a ""reward system"", that you get for working hard. It will actually trick your brain, because you want that reward right... you NEED it... so go do your damn shift.

You will have more respect for yourself, and your girlfriend will respect you also, if you just keep at it and get stuff done. This isn't even some ""bootstraps"" speech, you might have a shit job your whole life... but holding that job down will mean something."
5999,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"Don't ever let the woman you love smoke heroin because you need/want more dope. You more than likely will drag her down. Unless you are actively trying to get help you aren't being fair to her. Drugs will always come before her. Especially if you're getting sick. I've gotten numerous girls addicted to pills etc just by keeping them around me. Eventually they want to try this stuff that is so important to you. The girl I ""let"" smoke heroin. She ended up linking with ""friends"" of mine behind my back and using her parents money to IV pills. I don't think she would have ever done that has she not been exposed to the scum I scored from."
6000,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"My partner has been a heavy codieine addict for 15 years. She almost destroyed us financially and probably will in the future. She lies about it constantly...but I know when she's using. She looks so ill when she's heavy using and denies it even when caught. She's tried to get help but lies to the people trying to help her. She's lied and stole from everyone she loves. It's destroyed me but I'm stuck. I hate her having this hold over me as if I tell anyone it will ruin her. We have a child and I do not know if she is safe to look after her some days. There's no talking to her about it as she is a compulsive deluded liar in fear of losing everything...and by everything I mean sometimes her next hit/fix/hand full of tablets. 

So if you're worried then there's obviously something to worry about. You will at some point have to choose. Junkie or not. Or...just find yourself a user as a partner and spiral into coma's together safe in the knowledge that you both used and it wasn't your fault."
6001,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"The short and honest answer is yes, in my opinion. It’s probably possible for it not to be in very unique circumstances, but for most cases, it is selfish.

It’s a complicated question, to be sure. Rationalizations that one is protecting the other from pain in some way are just too easy to believe in, in the face of the challenges addiction presents."

What I meant as for your tolerance going up fast, recreationally, your tolerance will build in that sense. It will still be affective for maintenance treatment, and will be useful even at a lower dose, you just won’t get high. So yeah I’m not wrong but you’re also not right."

So yeah I’m not wrong but you’re also not right.","No your wrong, your talking about half life. When using recreational opiates they have a short half life, allowing you to get ""high"" and then come down ""low"" over a period of about 8-12 hours. Bupe's half life is incredibly long, for an opiate, so, over a period of say 24 hours, one dose of bupe will keep you ""high."" Taking bupe every 4 days or so allows you to dose, get high, come down and then repeat the process. If you dose bupe every other day or every day, you don't really come down you stay in a perpetual high which after a week or so, doesn't feel like you're high anymore, it becomes your new normal. So, you remove the Bupe and you get WDs. 

The other reason bupe is prescribed is because it also has a ceiling. For me, it's 8mg or so. Meaning, I can take 60mg and feel no difference between them.
TLDR: Bupe is used because people do not have to keep increasing dosage, and because it's safe with a ceiling, preventing ODs unless you combine with something like a benzo."

So when I would take it recreationally, I’d have about 3 days I could feel it then it wouldn’t do anything but I would need to wait 2 weeks or so before I could get high off it again. That’s where the tolerance from it would be built up. It still would have an affect on me and not allow me to have withdrawals but it would need to be out of your system before it would allow you to feel high off of it again. It was also the same where after about 8mg the affect would top out and it would be a waste to take anymore, so when I would do it recreationally, I could take 30mg if I wanted and not be any more high than if I would take 8-12mg."
6083,"This is completely wrong, bupe tolerance does not build fast. If bupe tolerance went up fast, so would your dosage when on Suboxone.  Bupe is used because you do not have to continue to increase dosage.",Maybe there’s a better thing to call it other than tolerance but the quested asked was how come I can’t get high off bupe after getting high from taking it for consistent days in a row. Well because it builds up in your system fast and then won’t give you a high once you’ve reached that point. Would that not be considered your tolerance going up? I take 8mg a day and have for 4 years. I have also came off it and took it recreationally and got high the first few days then did not anymore after that.

He also has Hep C, so his dietary protocol is advised by the fact that he needed to keep his LDL levels as high as he could possibly have them (necessitating a high saturated fat, high fat, ultra-low-carbohydrate diet, which is a dietary protocol that will not spike your blood sugar up) to prevent the virus from being able to replicate as efficiently. I'm not sure what sort of stock you should put in his advice. http://hopefulgeranium.blogspot.com/2012/09/how-to-come-off-methadone-without.html

For what it's worth, withdrawal is quite possibly the worst time to be attempting to start a ketogenic diet because you will egress salt faster than you can ingress it. I would prepare some bouillon and add salt to taste (taste it without, first) for electrolytes"

I used to get mad when I'd hear people call oxy ""synthetic heroin"", well technically they are both semi-synthetic opioids, but there is ignorance in that statement.... wait maybe not so much, because I get what they really meant now. There truly isn't much difference between oxy, opana, dilaudid, morphine, even hydrocodone, and heroin. Subtle differences yes but essentially they are all in the big leagues, the same animal, same euphoria and effects (and addiction and withdrawal) all on an equal enough level.

All the best opifam","I'm not up to date on their composition since reformulation. For the most part the biggest concern are particles under 50 microns in size as cigarette filters and cotton is essentially worthless for them. They will build up in your bloodstream (can't dissolve, but get injected and caught in small vessels), and especially places you really don't want them like vessels in your lungs. Yeah, it's fucking weird, but snorting and injecting pills will actually fuck up lungs pretty well over time. With years of it on you, I would really strongly advise doing all you can to stop further damage. It will cost you in yield and filters, not huge, but let's face it most opiate addicts aren't big on waste eh?

There is some additive common in pills that rides the line between soluble and insoluble in water, and idiots that cook their shots manage to push it over the edge into soluble territory, where it promptly precipitates in one's bloodstream. I am drawing a blank right now, but cold shots are highly important with pills especially.

Here is an excellent article explaining exactly how effective common filters are and what loss you can expect with them. It's based on MSContin, but will still apply for your situation. Biggest difference is likely to be whatever the current outer coating is, which I am not up to date on. Sorry. Strongly recommend reading the first few paragraphs at least, along with any sections on filtering methods you are willing to consider.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803777/

Ideally you would crush your pill(s) and cold water extract that, leave the solids. Then cotton/cig filter or equivalent, then wheel filter/micron filter. If you rinse a time or two you are looking at 80-90% yield of the good stuff with virtually no particulate, insoluble or semi soluble.

The cotton/cig filter before micron filter can be skipped and exists more to prevent clogging and thus accidental or frustrated bypassing/other loss.

Those little filters you are talking about, I assume I have had them before from an exchange. They are roughly equivalent to a cig filter in filtering ability but without added risks.

If you were a powder/tar user I wouldn't be stressing this nearly as much. Not if you just occasionally injected pills. Hope you look into this. That literature is useful, I promise. If you want to avoid nasty health complications 5+ years down the road the costs of playing it safe now have to be paid.


Microcrystalline cellulose isn't water soluble technically. In a basic/caustic and hot solution it does edge into soluble territory. Shouldn't be a significant issue, but with basic enough water in a boiled shot a small amount (small) is going to dissolve and crash out in the blood."

Much Love","No problem friend. Not much to do when it comes to vascular damage unfortunately. That plaque build up will be in part from naturally occurring stuff like ""bad"" cholesterol and whatnot, but be compounded with those particulates introduced. It hardens veinous tissue and kills elasticity. It creates blockages. The best thing you can do is limit further damage, and as odd as it is, mind your diet when it comes to cardiovascular health. If you get on top of it now hopefully it never results in some unfortunate bullshit like pulmanary embolism, stroke, or other nasty event. Not saying it will happen if you don't. Just that the odds really swing in the wrong direction.

I can't believe I am telling someone to mind their diet for cardiovascular health. I do a shit job on that myself. 

Thanks for caring about harm reduction. Been clean almost 3 years and just want to encourage spreading a little knowledge. No reason to be killing ourselves where it can be avoided."

Cheers","Autoclaves... Only way I imagine one gets access to one of those easily is being in good with an OR nurse or tech. Anyone who sterilizes medical equivalent on a regular basis. Maybe a surgical vet place if you know someone. I'm not sure where else to look. You can definitely buy one, but not exactly cheap. Amazon and especially Alibaba have them. Possibly eBay. Probably 500 entry though.

Ovens get hot enough on cleaning cycle, 800+, to near instantly sterilize technically. With a convection fan system it would *probably* work in a second or two. That involves breaking the locking mechanism and is a fire risk (so you can open during it). Might have done that to turn an oven into a pizza oven... Not sure if the plastic will appreciate more than a flash or two either. Also not a moist heat. It would work, but it's sketchy for not health related reasons and if you are renting there will be displeasure.

Those filters are still going to clog eventually. Not nearly as fast with 2 stage filtering, but how many uses if you sterilize I just don't know. You can disinfect, not truly sterilize, with isopropyl or boiling water. The issues with isopropyl, and more so boiling water, is the rapid regrowth of bacteria. Say you kill 1,000,000,000 out of 1,000,000,002 bacteria with isopropyl. Given a 24 hour period you are back to thousands of bacteria. Used as soon as it is fully dry, the probability you are going to be fine is good, just not 100% ya know? Even enough dead bacteria can become an issue over time too, granted it takes a lot. A not great example, but it gives the picture, say you lost a Tupperware of food in the fridge for a few months. It's gross, bacteria have colonized it thoroughly. You throw it in an oven and take it up to the 600F range. Ignore that some is burned. The inside is sterile, but it's still gross and may likely make you sick. You won't get salmonella or whatever it was poisoning, but those toxic byproducts in their corpses are still there.

Point is that non live bacteria isn't entirely washing off in a iso bath when it can hide in filter pores. An oral syringe? Fine for many washes, but those tiny pores less so. 

An autoclave is just pressurized steam, so maybe a pressure cooker rigged up with some creativity is doable. Probably would take distilled water and a stainless steel rack, but if you can keep the plastic from melting it would do the same thing. Distilled because while other water will become safe through use in the process, it does have minerals etc that may build up on that filter quick due to surface are and clog and harden it. Fast enough to matter? No idea. 

Really spitballing there. I never reused them, but I had them in bulk cheap. I know some have to drop 2-3 bucks a pop which is not great. I would rig a pressure cooker into an autoclave, but only after testing how many times you can get before one clogs or tears. Is it worth the effort?

The syringe should be fine with an iso wash, but clean it after use, and then again hit it with iso before use ideally. It's not technically staying sterilized unless you can close off it's eviroment after by vacuum sealing. In theory anyway. Not sure how many would actually bother with that, but iso is near free and evaporates quick. It's how I handled my tar drip syringe when I went intranasal over IV.

Not super helpful, but maybe you can get an extra use or two out of those filters. Regardless if you find a way to sterilize I don't think they should be reused too many times. They are eventually going to clog or rip on a microscopic level I imagine. I don't have any idea where to draw that line and no literature. If you make it safe from biological hazards it is still better than no micron filter as long as it doesn't break mid use.

Sorry for the ramble, I just don't have much literature I can access on this. Bluelight is the place to try for someone who does. They had an opiate, IV, and pill subforums and some PHD packing regulars back in the day at least with dozens of threads on proper technique. Just can't recall much on reuse of micron filters."

Because of the poor venous circulation, the skin below the level of the injection sites will always be prone to breakdown and in the event of injury, even small injuries, healing time will be greatly delayed (compare poorly controlled diabetics).

6284,Long term issues from collapsed veins?,I blew out a shitload of veins when I was using. The one good thing I will tell you is that you'll start to grow corollary veins within a few months. You'll end up with new veins that grew out of necessity to help blood flow.

Anyway back to the topic. My hands and wrists veins had accumulated scar tissue from years of IV use. Like you mentioned, my hands would fall asleep in no time if I ended up nodding out on my arms or dangling to the side. But I’ve cut back a lot since jumping back on methadone and lost connects (5-8+ shots/day to 0-4/month). I think my veins had the chance to repair since I find myself having little to no problems registering a hit and doesn’t fall asleep or get cold as fast as before.

A few years back, this one friend of mine caught my attention with how swollen his hands were for a guy who works out (was a heavy IV user but switched to smoking BTH due to no good veins). Not to be mean but it reminded me of Mickey Mouse hands lol. I’ve seen it mentioned in some articles as “puffy hand syndrome”.

6319,I really don’t need any sarcasm. How long would a Normal withdrawal be given I’ve taken 4-6 30mgs a day for about 1year,About a week
6320,I really don’t need any sarcasm. How long would a Normal withdrawal be given I’ve taken 4-6 30mgs a day for about 1year,It's tough to say because it's really different for everyone. If you can force yourself to exercise it will definitely make you feel better and help things along
6321,I really don’t need any sarcasm. How long would a Normal withdrawal be given I’ve taken 4-6 30mgs a day for about 1year,"Two weeks for the worst of it, with the first week sucking most. A month in, you will still have insomnia, and possibly chronic headaches...i did."
6322,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?","It will be hard. Continue running during it if you can, that has proven to be the one most effective thing to lessen withdrawal agony. I’m pretty sure most people here will agree with that. 

But you gotta pay the piper, and your dose is not insignificant."
6323,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Are you sure they are real oxy and not pressed fent? Cause fent is probably going to be a lot rougher
6324,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Depends on the daily dose of oxy. Your activity level will most likely shorten your withdrawal duration but might not lessen the intensity. Taper down if you can and jump from a smaller point.
6325,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Just taper off.  You may not have any acute withdrawal symptoms if you do that.
6326,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Are they 5mg or 80mg? Bit of a difference. Having never been in that kind of shape myself I can only assume your detox will be 10x worse than normal
6327,Are they 5mg or 80mg? Bit of a difference. Having never been in that kind of shape myself I can only assume your detox will be 10x worse than normal,30s. Why would it be worse?
6328,30s. Why would it be worse?,"I Can't think of any logical reason as to why it would be any worse than anyone else. They were asking about the strength because obviously if you're only taking 20 mg total that's a big difference than if you're taking 2 or 3 of the 80 mg pills. You have a fairly good tolerance, I would say that your withdrawals will be very similar to most other people's"

6332,Would snorting vs oral make a difference by way of bioavailability? I only snort them,"Tolerance and metabolism and bioavailability are so individualized. I would guess theoretically snorting it might be slightly less bioavailability so therefore slightly less per dose. But honestly if you've been taking 2 to 3 A-day for a while, despite the route of administration, you're gonna have to deal with their withdrawals. Maybe somebody will correct me but I can't imagine it making that much of a difference"
6333,30s. Why would it be worse?,Cause running sucks. Just messing with you. I would think being in good shape could only make things better for you

6335,4 to 6 oxys? What mg? And for how long?,"30. At most a year, may 8-10 months. But it always hasn’t been 4-6. Started as one or two then progressed to 4-6"

Started as one or two then progressed to 4-6","Bro if you’ve been doing 30s for a year even if it was just one a day, your WD will be pretty rough. But really if you have a strong mental going into it you might be over the WD in less than a week. I never really even noticed WD the first year I used. I only really every noticed WD symptoms after trying heroin. Although the 30s I used were fent the shorter half-life seems to produce a more intense but shorter WD than something with a longer lasting half-life."
6337,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?","Dude I used to be FIT and eating “clean” paleo pasture raised meat etc, every drug high was so much better and the withdrawals were so much easier"
6338,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,"benzos just make me feel flat and depressed and drugged.  never got high off them  apart from when i first did 5mg diazepam before i had an opiate tolerance.

also since having a high opiate tolerance, weed does nothing but make me feel unpleasantly tired. it doesn't get me high at all.  when I get off opiates properly i'd like to try weed to see what it's ""really"" like."
6339,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,I’m the opposite I only feel the benzos if I do that
6340,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,Be extremely careful mixing these two. Its so easy to go over the edge with benzos in your system. Especially if youre doing dope and not just pills.
6341,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,id say because an opiate high is stronger
6342,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,Yes. It will def help. But the hard part will be when u aee totally clean
6343,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,"More times than I can tell you! You just need to take methadone at a dose that makes you feel normal for 3 to 5 days. Same dose each day.

You may need a low dose of klonopin to help you sleep -- less than .05 mgs.

That's it."
6344,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,"Yes, it worked like a boss. Best part about methadone is that you will still usually feel ok the next day as well. Space out out your doses as much as you can. A higher dose is good initially...lower it the second or third day."
6345,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,Would this method work as good with subs as methadone?
6346,What’s a high off Tramadol like?,People either love tram or hate it. You either convert it good or bad. Don’t exceed 200mg because that’s when it starts lowering your seizure threshold. Start with 100
6347,People either love tram or hate it. You either convert it good or bad. Don’t exceed 200mg because that’s when it starts lowering your seizure threshold. Start with 100,400mg is the limit.
6348,What’s a high off Tramadol like?,take 100 mg and then in an hr take another 100mg. when the second 100 mg hits it's a pure euphoric nod just don't be in public you should be with friends. i do heroin and not pills but i would still do tramadol.
6349,So are different brand oxy 30s different in anyway? Like m30s compared to a215 or k9s . Legally it should all be the same strength but I feel like I have favorites (k9s) is this in my head and it’s the same stuff or is there some info behind this? But what are your favorite ?,"Its in your head man. Theyre all the same, all oxy (unless theyre pressed of course)

Edit: my fav are the mboxes just bc of the nostalgia i have. They were my first oxy 30s"
6350,So are different brand oxy 30s different in anyway? Like m30s compared to a215 or k9s . Legally it should all be the same strength but I feel like I have favorites (k9s) is this in my head and it’s the same stuff or is there some info behind this? But what are your favorite ?,FDA regulation says for any medicine it can have +- 10% of the advertised dose so some brands might have more or less but it’s pretty negligible. Usually the size of the pill is what matters most to people because they don’t want to snort a bunch of powder like in the RP30s

For some reason I felt like these smoked the best but in reality all of them smoked pretty damn well back then.... lol"
6352,RP 15. Do they actually suck or am I just convincing myself that cuz they are different?,I didnt mind them back when I was on my daily habit like 3 or 4 years ago but it sucks to snort if you do.  Such an ass ton of powder you are better of chomping that fucker down.
6353,RP 15. Do they actually suck or am I just convincing myself that cuz they are different?,"They work fine for me, and I have never seen or heard of a pressed one (although I don’t doubt they exist) but I have noticed a lingering headache when I get a batch of them."
6354,RP 15. Do they actually suck or am I just convincing myself that cuz they are different?,"IMO, they suck. Sorry."
6355,"IMO, they suck. Sorry.",Yeah eating them was 100% better but still garbage . I don’t understand how something with the same ingredients can be so much different ? Must have a weird filler in it or something .
6356,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,Wait about 12 hours after the last tram dose I'd assume
6357,Wait about 12 hours after the last tram dose I'd assume,Ok thank you.
6358,Ok thank you.,The longer you wait the better 12-18 hours seems like enough though
6359,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,The fuck? This is medicine and they decided to close shop early? How early/what time did you get there?
6360,The fuck? This is medicine and they decided to close shop early? How early/what time did you get there?,"Yeah. It’s a new chemist (drug store) closer to my home. As I was going into town each day for my dose. But that was a mission so my rehab found a closer place to my house. 

I started going there on Friday. The staff said they are open until 7pm every day. Then yesterday the manager said they’ll be closing Monday so she’ll give me my dose. She said she was also thinking of closing early Sunday as Monday is public holiday here and she’ll give me a take home for then. 

But I arrived and apparently they went home around 6pm. Shop next to them said so. I dose late in the day. So this has left me in the shit. Lucky a home call dr wrote me a small one off script for tramadol to last the next 2 days. But this means I’ve relapsed. I would’ve been ok if she called and told me to come in. But maybe because I’m new there she forgot about me. Sucks"

I would only use the tramadol if you truely, TRUELY feel dope sick. Maybe Monday morning then hold out and get to the chemist early.

If possible change your dose times too."

Ah I was super sick by 8pm our time which was over 24hrs since my sub dose. I got a home doctor visit and he gave me a prescription for a small amount to just lesson the withdrawals over two days. Tomorrow is the public holiday so I’d be going a couple days from my withdrawals. 

I’ve only been on suboxone for 1 month so having to use tramadol isn’t too depressing. If I had been on the program for a while I would’ve been pretty upset taking them. I’ll just have to talk to this new chemist to make sure this doesn’t happen again. I’ll be doing take home dosage soon anyways. But yeah. I have dealt with 3 months of on and off chaotic usage and withdrawals and was so not prepared to go a couple days when I’ve put a lot of effort into rehab and suboxone stabilising."

It sounds like you did everything possible in your power to avoid a situation like this. Unfortunately things outside your control will always happen. While the tramadol may in fact be your substance of choice, you aren't necessarily using it in an abusive manner, or as some would say in true relapse fashion lol. You are simply taking it to prevent withdrawal, just like your Suboxone. Although your rehab may definitely see this as a technical infraction, with full transparency of everything you have described to us, I believe your rehab will understand and not make too big a deal of it. If they do, in your heart you know you didn't relapse. Keep up the good work and props for not using this as a reason to say fuck it and burn it down. ✌️"

I was feeling a bit depressed about it at first. But I’m ok with it now. I have rehab psychologist tomorrow. But they’re super understanding and I did call one member of my rehab the night I couldn’t get my dose (they have one member stationed at the local hospital most nights. But they cannot subscribe anything. Just advice or help with WD symptoms) who said try and see if a doctor can help out for the two days because I’ve been following all the right steps and no need to put myself through WDs if it’s 2 days. Just to not go overboard and I need to make sure I speak with the chemist to make sure this doesn’t happen again just so I don’t have the needless stress of a dumb situation. 

Thanks for the kind words tho mate. Cheered me up"
6365,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,"No. You'll be fine. 

As long as there is a bit of sub in your system still, you will not be at risk for precipitated withdrawal 

Also, tramadol is atypical in its opi effects, and can be taken concurrently with subs"
6366,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,yes. you can dose your sub as you normally would. two days isn’t a long enough time period for all of the bupe to be removed from your receptors. as long as there is bupe still in your system you’ll avoid any pwds that could possibly occurre otherwise. unless you’re a freak of nature.
6367,When will people learn?,Stupidity + desperation = easy target

6387,I finally got my hands on some kratom after day 3 of WD. I also have some zanaflex. Should I mix them?,If you’re on the third day a 4-5 gram dose of kratom should be plenty.  Inbox me if you have any other questions.
6388,I finally got my hands on some kratom after day 3 of WD. I also have some zanaflex. Should I mix them?,"2mg zanaflex tablets are rather large for such a small amount of active compound, so snorting tablets doesn't seem like an efficient method of delivery. Although a nasal spray is in trials and does have higher bioavailability due to the bypass of first pass metabolism, it requires pH buffers and absorption enhancers. But back to your question, I'm assuming that you chose a red strain of Keaton as your intended use is to control WDs. Zanaflex however administered, will likely add to the sedative effects of a red vein kratom but not much else. I have not tried this combination, but I have mixed kratom with baclofen, benzos and phenibut, and found them to compliment each other nicely. For me, 7g kratom with 1mg Klonopin hits the sweet spot. If your goal is simply to potentiate the effects of your kratom, you should first consider mixing it with grapefruit juice adding about a tablespoon of turmeric and a large pinch of black pepper. Ginger is also an effective enhancer and will help within a nausea you may experience from the kratom. These are much cheaper and more available options then the zanaflex you're attempting to use. If you insist on trying your zanaflex and kratom combination, I would at least add the ginger turmeric and black pepper mixture to control the stomach pain you will inevitably experience. Best of luck"

Personally I recommend magnesium gluconate however magnesium citrate is more readily available and much more affordable.

6589,How many days can you take subs with out feeling wds from them when you stop?,I don’t understand your question if your an active addict and you switch to subs you will withdrawal if you stop taking them just as you would on heroin. If you aren’t a junkie there’s really no reason to take subs more than once in a while for a high that just makes you want regular opiates anyway. But if you’ve already been taking them anywhere from a few days to a week +  of taking them everyday will you begin to feel withdrawal. The thing about it is it’s hard to gauge if your withdrawing from something if your not already knee deep in an addiction. I didn’t think I had any withdrawals at all the first few months of doing tons of perks everyday most days it was almost a year before I could recognize I was in clear cut withdrawal. Times before that I’d feel funky or lethargic but I wouldn’t attribute it to withdrawal but looking back i know now it was the beginning  of wds

I did cut back drinking dramatically which feels great this past week.  And I am committing to a 25 day taper down to 60mg then jump off completely and leverage kadian.

Thanks for following up.  I do think of my kids and wife daily, hourly even.  And that is what is making this so crucial for me to do.  Thanks again"

Have you looked into Kratom at all though? It worked really well for me for my adhd and social anxiety, its cheap, u cant OD, u dont have to wait on any dealers etc, and more importantly it wont take your soul. The key is LOW doses. .5-2.5G honestly improved my life and gave me lots of energy. It does keep the door open though as far as opioids in your brain.   It also works AMAZING for WD, like a complete gamechanger."

It also works AMAZING for WD, like a complete gamechanger.","Yes I have tons on hand.  However with my situation and my plan to come off oxy completely, Kratom isn’t idea for a couple reasons:
1) id need to start w 7gram doses 3x per day and taper down 1 gram per dose per week likely.  Kratom powder can sludge up your liver and go tract at that much.  But it’s totally doable and I believe I can be successful there
2) more importantly, the way Kratom binds to and saturates opioid receptors, ibogaine doesn’t have 95% success rate as it does with traditional, whort acting opioids like oxycodone, heroin, morphine.  I’m 100% committed to my I Ogaden plan, pre and post treatment for coaching, integration and long term abstinence.  I plan to implement Victoria after ibogaine sets me free and repairs the opioid receptors and the brain damage I’ve caused to my natural serotonin firings.  

So that being said i can go on Kratom, large doses, and likely still have to deal with a min level of wd, and then switch back to oxy 2-3 weeks before ibogaine treatment and healing

Or

I can just taper my current supply of oxy blues, change from snorting to oral, get down to 45-60 mg per day “coasting dose” then kick and heal completely with ibogaine.  

Or yet so the same above but after I taper to 45-60 jump on kadian for a few weeks until ibogaine.  Leaning toward this option.  

I have to remain fully functional and top of my game the next 3 months to get my businesses crushing before I leave for Mexico for 3 weeks:  I’m willing to put in the work.  I just know myself by now and what will likely works best is the taper/kadian/ibogaine.

Anyone have success or experience with these options?’

Thanks again"

6628,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"15 mg will help you sleep a bit but save it until you are desperate !

People have loads of stuff you can take like over the counter meds but they dont help much and slow down getting to the felling better point

The non substance ways i have found help easy WD are

Hot baths/showers lots and lots of them

Forcing your self to exercise in some way walk as much as you can and as fast as you can , remember if there was a bag at the end of the walk you would run!

Anything that takes your mine of it.. films , computer games and the like , its all about passing time each film is an hour and a half closer to felling better..

&#x200B;

masturbating!! yup do it as much as your libido will let you!

may sound messed up but it will take away the wd for a few moments. i think like the exercise it get the endorphins going .. natural opiates"

6630,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"Jesus where do I start. I spent more time *in* withdrawal than I did high for a really long time and worked out a system that wouldn't make the WD's go away but make them tolerable.

Tools:
* Loperamide
* Trazodone
* Klonopin or any benzo
* Food (sweets are good)
* Drinks
* Nicotine (important)

So Loperamide by itself will help with WDs immensely if you take enough. No, it will **not** cause your heart to flip upside down and start to die. Not in the amounts I take. I take 20, 2mg pills and wait 2 hours then take 10 more if I need it. It takes 2 hours to work so wait it out.

Trazodone is pretty decent at getting you to sleep if you're taking lope too. By itself, it will put you to sleep if your WDs are mild, but if in full blown Opana or Heroin wd, traz wont be enough.

Klonopin/Benzos are a godsend. Basically, life is worth living again with benzos alone but mixed with lope, its a sure thing.

Food/Drink and Nicotine - Basically, after you eat a lot of food you tend to get sleepy and when in WD, sleep is hard to come by. If I'm allowed to sleep whenever I want throughout the day (like on the weekend) the second I feel remotely sleepy, I go to bed. 

I can increase the success rate for this by timing my eating and drinking along with any form of nicotine. So say, I'll force down some ice cream or pasta or any heavy carb meal and then when I start to get that sedated feeling 30-40 mins after eating, I'll smoke or vape heavily and within 5 or 10 mins I'm ready to try to sleep.

Even with benzos I've been in withdrawal so bad that I still can't sleep and aren't willing to take 3-5mg of xanax with no tolerance just to try to sleep. That always scared me.

I don't always have benzos but usually have trazodone and lope and between them and some well timed meals and some ahem, *personal* time, I can usually squeeze out a couple hours sleep  throughout the day if I'm lucky.

If I take much larger doses of lope like 30+ 2mg pills at a time my success rate goes way up but that much lope feels dirty af.

I know this is sort of a shoddy process with a lot of goofy combos. You don't need trazodone if you have benzos for instance."
6631,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"It will help, but if you are on heroin or oxy, what you need is a few days worth  -- 3 to 5 days -- of methadone at a dose that makes you feel normal.  You can bypass or at least seriously reduce acute withdrawal symptoms that way."
6632,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,Help
6633,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"Benzos are what gets me though. I couldn’t have switched from methadone to Suboxone without them.

Magnesium and other supplements are good. Magnesium helps with muscle aches and cramps. Eating well, drinking lots of water. If you’ve got diarrhoea or vomiting, or you’re not eating much at all, Gatorade/electrolyte drinks help.

Try to keep yourself busy, even if it’s just having something good to binge on Netflix. Have everything done so you don’t need to worry about shopping, washing, or errands.

Keeping a diary is good. Score yourself /10 for mood, muscle ache, cramps, vomiting/diarrhoea, anxiety, etc... that way you’ll see that you’re getting better over time. Also keep track of medication, food, and water.

I like guided meditations. I find it’s easier to sleep with them. I’ll link one in.

If you have a spare room, you should use that to detox. I think they say that because you don’t want to associate your bedroom and bed with being sick.

Edit: https://youtu.be/ZAJFk0RQ0J0 search ‘guided mediation and sleep’ in YouTube, it took me awhile to find voices I liked. Goodluck!"

6635,You're the best thank you. I took 10 mg about 10 minutes ago or so already feel much better. I'm on day two of wd and it feels like it will never end,"It’s awful isn’t it. Do you have enough valium to get you through the next few days? I made sure u had a decent stash of valium and Xanax. The worst was I had to go into my clinic each day. I’d feel a bit better as the Suboxone was wearing off, and the underlying methadone took hold, ...but then I’d dose at the clinic and be thrown back into withdrawals. I would have quit if I didn’t need to be on Suboxone to travel.

Here’s the form the doctors use to gauge withdrawal. It’s only physical symptoms though. I felt more in control keeping track, but not everyone would.

6653,Tips on potentiating snorting oxy?,You can’t boost bioavailability of snorting as it bypasses the liver entirely and goes directly into your bloodstream. White grapefruit juice might make the half life longer though as your liver enzymes are impaired by it and will not be able to filter the oxy out of your blood as efficiently as normal. You could also try taking 50 mg of Benadryl (DPH) as it will allow you to nod much easier and reduce a lot of the itchiness oxy comes with.

6667,"Well how can I get a script for pain meds? I have scoliosis, wore a brace as a child if that helps","Just do a search in this subreddit. I come across pretty detailed and accurate instructions on here daily.
Just be prepared to start out with non-opiates and physical therapy and gradually (hopefully) working your way up to low-grade opiates etc etc .
And never EVER ask for anything specific, they’ll see directly through that and label you as a drug seeker and terminate everything. 
Also, a pain management referral is what you will eventually want/need in order to get any kind of monthly prescription. And ‘if’ you’re lucky enough to eventually get some kind of script, you will be subjected to drug tests and pill counts to make sure you’re not abusing your script and / or mixing it with other drugs. If you fail one of those you’ll also be booted.
Good Luck"

When I was first dabbling in opioids I really liked the chill, relaxing qualities. I thought to myself, “how could something so soft be as dangerous as I’ve been told.”

I just assumed these people had weak willpower. I had zero concept of physical withdrawals. I wrongfully assumed the decision to use opioids or not was as simple as choosing tea or juice with breakfast. 

I’ve been off for about 40 days now. After 20 years of destructive behavior and habits. I’ve been off before, once i was clean for 13 months, I relapsed. Another time I was clean for three years, I slipped right back in. It’s a lifelong struggle. 

I really do wish I could go back.

6693,How long can i use painkillers without getting withdrawals?,For me it's usually if I use for more than 4 days in a row or a week of every other day. The withdrawals aren't bad at that point but still not pleasant.

6695,How long can i use painkillers without getting withdrawals?,"Just remember, the longer you go the worse it gets."
6696,How long can i use painkillers without getting withdrawals?,"Also spreading your use out helps keep your tolerance down.  There’s a real sweet spot in between using casually and trying to ward off withdrawals. When I had little knowledge of what my limits were I took something about 6 days in a row and experienced what I imagine was minuscule withdrawals in the scheme of things. But it was a good wake up call me, cos it still sucked. Enjoy!"

6698,How long can i use painkillers without getting withdrawals?,If u take enough tramadol it’s definitely not shit
6699,If u take enough tramadol it’s definitely not shit,i agree. see a lot of people on here saying they’re worthless but for me it provides a euphoric buzz that lasts for ~12h. depends on the person though.

6706,Just a writer trying to make a character more real! Mind if I ask some questions?,"I have never used heroin, but there are some things I could tell you about opium. The smell oh, HELL, when smoked I sense it as sweet meat, never had sweet sausages but I'd imagine them to taste like that, and that taste, after a long night of smoking, lingers for the entire day after. The substance itself smells more like weeds, like cut grass almost with the smallest hint of sweet and tastes extremely bitter. A problem I often have is opium fingers, yeah, like cheeto fingers but way more expensive, opium is usually very brittle so cutting pieces off produce a lot of crumbs, the other presentation is like a sticky gum, similar to hashish if you have handled it, either way, it's not the easiest thing to work with, so sometimes I endup with opium smelling, sticky fingers. Hope that helps!"

As far as your questions, I don't have much time, so I'll just say this: Most books, movies, shows, etc. that I've read or seen tend to portray heroin/opioid use and abuse in ab unrealistic manner to say the least, obviously some moreso than others. Think of examples you yourself are familiar with and it's probably safe to assume that you don't want to do it like they did. 

As for quality examples from fiction, Borroughs is great and Trainspotting is fairly accurate. Not heroin-centric, but A Scanner Darkly is a wonderful depiction of many aspects of addiction.

You’re right when you say that there’s too much context to fully explain it, but I can offer you some hammerin’! 

He’s a heroin addict because the opportunity to be one fell in his lap. Kinda the theory that you can’t sell dope if you don’t know the quality of what you’re selling. As a teenager, he experimented with anything you could possibly ever smoke and heroin was his favorite. My character really likes downers in general, but as he got older and started using more and more, the addiction got more serious. He started to shoot up instead of smoking. Feeling like he would be into downers and given the era this is all based on, heroin/opium seemed like the right fit to be his drug of choice. 

It’s not to glorify drug use, that I can assure you. I’m not trying to make this sexy or appealing, and I’m definitely trying to make it as accurate as I can."

A victorian Heroin user would not have been using a spoon to cook up, they would have been using their mail order syringe kit to inject the gear.

And back then Heroin use was not very common.  It was a novel drug - Morphine was the big ""epidemic"" at the time.  I'd consider making your character a Morphine addict, but I guess it doesn't have the same ""Shock"" value as H does.

Opium in the victorian era was legally available and I'd say the vast majority of opiate addicts used plain Opium.

Read Thomas de Quincey's book - he would buy opium at his local pharmacy (he'd walk in and the pharmacist would give him ""the usual"")  and he would take it orally.  Later he got hooked on laudanum (opium tincture).

Also, if your main character doesn't have access to a steady supply, if he has any kind of habit, the book will just be about your main character hustling to try to get dope."

Heroin, benzos, and other depressants give a certain numbness. I’m coming down off Suboxone at the moment, and I’d forgetten how bad it was to feel everything. Anxiety, sadness, depression, as well as physical pain. It’s awful.

With heroin you can just do a “miss”, which would still get the drugs in your system but that’s not enough for some... it’s the blood lust to get that one certain vein and (as I watched my ex do so many times...) they will dig and dig until finding that vein. It’s almost an obsession like quality. So sad and so, so dangerous."

6729,What causes withdrawal symptoms to change over time?,"My w/d's change depending on what I'm kicking. Oxy, opana, heroin, fent all have very different symptoms. I mean they all consist of the same basic symptoms but they hit at different times if that makes sense. Like opana and fent would have me in near panic attack mode due to my anxiety in under 12 hours where that hits in about 36 hours with heroin. My stomach would be fucked up around 18 to 24 off oxy and can normally make it 48 til its really bad off heroin. Also it varies depending on if I'm shooting or snorting or smoking and how long I have been using for this time and how much I'm using daily. So many variables."

6740,how strong is oxy compared to hydros?,"1.5:1  exactly  , even with oral  bioavailability  taken into  account  thats an accurate  ratio.
So 30 mg of hydro = 20mg of oxy 
But its a different type  opioid   as its main alkaloid  is different  its far less sedating  and a lot more euphoric.  Id say start with 10-15 mg of oxy and add 5 mg every 45 mins till you reach  desired  result. Be careful  with it but oxy is still a relatively  weak opiod.
Just be carefully  of pressed  pills oxy is the most counterfeited pill out there so always  test ur oxy for fentanyl  if its not from the pharmacy, even if you trust your source, ur fuckin up already because **rule #1 is trust nobody** they may not even know  themselves. Anyways be safe  and enjoy oxy is probably  the most fun enjoyable opiate out there.

6787,"Dude, so true...

It would be a great contribution to the world. I've had just about enough of this ""war on drugs"". Opiates are technically some of the safest drugs there are. As long as you don't mix them with obscene amounts of other downers with little to no tolerance, they really are pretty benign. They cause no permanent brain or organ damage and the side effects are pretty minimal.  Society is ignorant and uneducated about any of it, they just blatantly believe what they're told. Not everyone can remain ""clean"" and when you think about how drugs like alcohol are legal, why should they? Alcohol is the worst drug there is, in my opinion. It damages the brain, your organs, leads to domestic violence and traffic accidents, yet it's celebrated like it's something great.   


People should have the right to wake up and take whatever helps them get through their day without blowing their brains or some one else's out. The fact that America incarcerates potheads and opiate addicts, while letting bars flourish everywhere, where drunks can get completely retarded and then drive home and kill another innocent family just boils my blood!  Getting a little off topic here, but I feel it's all relevant and it's an area I'm very passionate about. I wish I wasn't just another ordinary citizen and had some power to get things changed. What happened to our right of ""pursuit of happiness""? If my happiness comes from diacetylmorphine, shouldn't I have that right to pursue it!?

yes, well off and living comfortably enough that i recently turned down an opportunity to get back in the game with basically everything already setup and all the hard work done for me. it was a turn-key opportunity to make anywhere from $5k-$6k per month with plugs who had cheap but quality product already established as well as a large customer-base.

to explain what i mean by that: one of my best friends, also a fellow Reddit user, started dealing about 2 years ago and he was BRAND NEW to the game when it came to dealing. i helped him a lot at the beginning with plugs and sent him some customers that ended up being really lucrative who paid top dollar retail prices for large amounts on a consistent basis. he eventually over the next 2 years and some ups and downs ended up building this into a very successful operation that was pulling in approximately $10k-$12k per month in profits. he kept records of all his sales and P&Ls on an Excel spreadsheet, so i saw the exact revenue he was generating from this operation.

side note: he also paid me a commission for the customers i sent him, approximately $500 cash in total as well as some really nice gifts like designer clothes (Versace, Diesel, etc) and free drugs including 10 subs and an entire piece (ounce) of tar at once, 100% free (that was a good night lol)

he contacted me one day and said he wanted to setup a meeting, so i went and met him a his hotel room and he sat me down for a literal presentation on Powerpoint (lmao) showing me all the current and projected profits along with plans for expansion, etc and told me that he wanted me to join him in business and come take what was rightfully mine (aka half of the business & profits). he guaranteed me $1k/week minimum or half of the profits, whichever was bigger, and at that current time he was bringing in appoximately $10k-$12k in profits per month which translates to $5k-$6k per month in profit for me.

at that time, and still currently, i was working a sales job and making just a little under that (approx $4k/month after taxes) and while it was very tempting to say ""fuck a job"" and join him, after careful consideration i declined his offer because it wasn't worth the risk plus nothing is guaranteed when it comes to the game. one small mistake or change and everything could fall apart, or worse. and it's a good thing i made that choice, because he has been in jail for a couple of months now for Felony Evading Police as well as some probation violations and he will be there for a couple more months. another part of the reason i declined is because when i was in the game, i was very very careful and took every caution possible to stay safe and he was the exact opposite, very ""loud"" and sloppy and i knew there would not only be issues between us in how things were run but i knew it was only a matter of time before something bad happened.

A lot of people think that $5-$6k a month is insane money, and I guess for some people it is, but if you get a sales charge on an operation that big, you’re going away for a long time.

And you're absolutely right. What made it even easier to turn down is that somehow, by the grace of the Universe, I have avoided ever catching a charge throughout all my years of using, selling, etc which is literally a miracle considering I have done some really grimey shit in and have ran lots of hustles in the past. I've also gotten SUPER close to getting hemmed up on multiple occasions but somehow always was able to walk between the raindrops.

you are right about the stress, i have sold H in the past on a smaller scale as well and it was extremely stressful. there are so many factors that make it stressful and so many things to worry about from running the business in general, to sketchy customers, potentially being arrested or robbed, having someone OD on your product and it be traced back to you, making sure u don't run out of product and get sick, etc the list goes on and on.

throughout my career as a full-time dealer, i've had several different situations where i had some sort of law enforcement agency up my ass... from the local police, to the DEA, to the FBI (twice) although the FBI weren't really up my ass, they were investigating a close associate of mine both times, one time it probably wasn't that big of a deal but the other time, i'm certain they were watching me to some extent because i was the main supplier for a particular piece of contraband (not drugs) that my friend got caught committing felonies with. i've been on their radar since i was in high school though as well, so it's not that surprising. i remember coming home from a friend's house one day, when i was 17, and my Dad freaked out on me, screaming and yelling at me, because our neighbor told him that they saw an undercover cop across the street by their house sitting in their car, surveilling and taking pictures of our house.

as far as drug-related, one of my customers got caught with a gram of dope on him right after i served him and he was on probation, so they tried to get him to cooperate and perform a couple of controlled buys on me in exchange for sweeping his probation violation under the rug. he randomly hit me up 2 weeks later after i served him that day and told me he just got out of jail and he told what they tried to get him to do. i was honestly surprised cuz this dude wasn't really a close friend or anything, more of an acquaintance that i worked with at one point.

i've also been into hacking and cybercrime since i was a young kid (11 yrs old or so) and have ran a lot of rackets online in the past, and while i have always had pretty good opsec, i know for a fact that my activities did not go unnoticed and that i was probably on a list somewhere at some point. at one point, a server that i was operating from got seized by the Secret Service lol i still have the article somewhere from that one.

the things i've described in the post aren't even half of the times i've suspected that i was under investigation or came really close to getting completely fucked, probably for a very long time lol thankfully i've put all of that in the past and don't have to live looking back over my shoulders constantly...

but yes, my friend was ridiculously ""loud"" and kinda had that ""i'm scarface and untouchable"" type of attitude. he was notoriously sloppy and uncareful when it came to keeping a low-key profile. among the many, many things he did that were careless and irresponsible, one example is that he was almost always driving around, unnecessarily, with a life sentence in his car. i'm talking a bag with 5+ ounces of dope, an ounce of crystal or coke, ounce of molly, scales, bags, paraphernalia like pipes and rigs, large amounts of cash, weapons, etc. the only thing he was missing was a body in the trunk, and, he was on probation so they could search without probable cause. for a while, he wasn't even supposed to be driving cuz he had absconded on probation, so if they pulled him over and ran his name, he was done for. but he would drive around like this, all to deliver a couple grams of dope when he had a perfectly safe home to store all this illegal product at instead of only taking the absolute bare minimum needed so that he wasn't riding dirty. he would also regularly post up in sketchy places like random parking lots at 3am with all of this on him to get high. it stressed me out SO MUCH to hang out with him once he started behaving like this, which he didn't always act like this, only once the power got to his head did he start acting so careless.

so yeah, when he proposed for me to join him, i immediately knew that there was no way i was going to accept because we operated completely different and would have had many differences when it came to how we operated. i valued my freedom and there is a reason that i was able to do it so long without catching a single charge. i took the absolute bare minimum risk and took every precaution possible, always had a plan and then backup plan, and because of that i narrowly avoided getting hemmed up several, several times.

a while back, he told me that two of his runners got setup and picked up by the DEA or drug task force or something of that nature and one of them was a spineless, huge piece of shit who, without a doubt, rolled over and snitched the second they gave him the opportunity to. so he was already probably being watched and investigated and he ended up committing a Felony Evading Police when they tried to pull him over, but there is a no chase policy where i live so they didn't get him that night and he got away but a couple of weeks later the SWAT team rolled up on him at like 5am and arrested him at this house for running that one night, among other things i am sure... and i probably would have went down with him that night as well cuz i'm sure i would have been with him at his house.

damn, i didn't mean to type that much... sorry for the novel lmao"

yes, well off and living comfortably enough that i recently turned down an opportunity to get back in the game with basically everything already setup and all the hard work done for me. it was a turn-key opportunity to make anywhere from $5k-$6k per month with plugs who had cheap but quality product already established as well as a large customer-base.

to explain what i mean by that: one of my best friends, also a fellow Reddit user, started dealing about 2 years ago and he was BRAND NEW to the game when it came to dealing. i helped him a lot at the beginning with plugs and sent him some customers that ended up being really lucrative who paid top dollar retail prices for large amounts on a consistent basis. he eventually over the next 2 years and some ups and downs ended up building this into a very successful operation that was pulling in approximately $10k-$12k per month in profits. he kept records of all his sales and P&Ls on an Excel spreadsheet, so i saw the exact revenue he was generating from this operation.

side note: he also paid me a commission for the customers i sent him, approximately $500 cash in total as well as some really nice gifts like designer clothes (Versace, Diesel, etc) and free drugs including 10 subs and an entire piece (ounce) of tar at once, 100% free (that was a good night lol)

he contacted me one day and said he wanted to setup a meeting, so i went and met him a his hotel room and he sat me down for a literal presentation on Powerpoint (lmao) showing me all the current and projected profits along with plans for expansion, etc and told me that he wanted me to join him in business and come take what was rightfully mine (aka half of the business & profits). he guaranteed me $1k/week minimum or half of the profits, whichever was bigger, and at that current time he was bringing in appoximately $10k-$12k in profits per month which translates to $5k-$6k per month in profit for me.

at that time, and still currently, i was working a sales job and making just a little under that (approx $4k/month after taxes) and while it was very tempting to say ""fuck a job"" and join him, after careful consideration i declined his offer because it wasn't worth the risk plus nothing is guaranteed when it comes to the game. one small mistake or change and everything could fall apart, or worse. and it's a good thing i made that choice, because he has been in jail for a couple of months now for Felony Evading Police as well as some probation violations and he will be there for a couple more months. another part of the reason i declined is because when i was in the game, i was very very careful and took every caution possible to stay safe and he was the exact opposite, very ""loud"" and sloppy and i knew there would not only be issues between us in how things were run but i knew it was only a matter of time before something bad happened.

i don't regret declining his offer one bit and still work at my cushy office job to this day",r/ThatHappened

6830,"I’m a firm believer in the theory that the dealers of heroin are just as addicted to the lifestyle/social interactions of “the life” as the addicts are.

They say its not only the drug that you get addicted to, but the process of seeking drugs out and the thrill of going to get them etc etc..

And not only that, but when you have a good plug, your addict-brain fools you into thinking they’re almost your friend when they hook you up with an extra point ; and then they’re a necessary evil hate-love relationship, kind of like a girlfriend you fight with all the time.

But yeah, I think the dealers are just as addicted to the life and the rush of quick money when you flip a pak and stuff. Getting to know your customers and being a halfway decent human being goes a LONG way for a lot of addicts... if dealers operated under even the most common of senses, i might have an answer for ya haha",A thousand percent True

Welcome to the wild, woolly, and sometimes maybe even warm world of physically dependent heroin addicts. 

Personally I have Ph-fucking-Ds from the junkie equivalent of MIT in rationalization, cognitive dissonance, avoidance, and denial. In other words if my only perceived route to getting well was to get over on you, I’d do it. I wouldn’t be proud of myself or enjoy doing it and I’d always feel guilty afterwards. I knew it was poor business sense if I was trying to middle for people or whatever: But if that’s what it took to be okay, part of me did what I did while part of me insisted I’m still not that guy deep down right? 

So if I did what your dude did and I came up a few days later or whatever I’d seek to make it right too. Exactly as he did, come on really earnest and desperate to make it right. 

I know people make a big deal of their reputations and that they’d never steal or whatever. That’s cool if you’re able to “manage a habit” or you’re on the dealer side of things where trust often matters quite a bit. Frankly when heroin started to cost me everything that made me human (ironically I did it because it made me feel human) I put aside what other people who did heroin thought of me. It wasn’t a disorder or a bad learned behavior or a disease to me, it was a moral failure and a sin. A product of my inability to look the world in the eye. I assumed everyone else was on their trip like mine, which was so far from reality I can’t believe I was so naive. But since I thought that every other heroin user was a spineless tortured oversensitive quasi-suicidal loser like me, I could easily dismiss whatever your opinion became of me. 

“Thief”? Big deal - you were stealing your family’s peace of mind and a parent from your kid and a partner from your spouse and a decent person from society. You were all part of the problem and you loved it. Why should I care about what you thought of me, as long as it didn’t interfere with my other connects?

But if things lined up where I could “do the right thing” and salvage a drug acquaintanceship, sure I’d do it."

It is an interesting subject, though, because when you think about it, who is responsible when the middle gets ripped or fucked up?  Middles always justify charging me more or taking part of the order by saying that they are taking all the risk.  I’m fine paying middles (or providing them part of the order) accordingly.  However, if I’m paying a middle to assume the risk, they should assume the risk of robbery and loss and therefore, if they take a front, pay it back if they don’t deliver my product.

Of course, that is the logical business reasoning behind the distribution of risk and responsibility.  As most middles are junkies themselves, they are often far removed from any sort of logic or reasoning."

Apparently he’s still recovering from whatever loss he took (or whatever reason he robbed me).  That is kind of what I found most impressive, though.  He met up with me at first today and had two bags to give me so I took that and didn’t buy anything additional.  As he made more sales throughout the day, though, he ended up calling me back and meeting up with me another two times; once to give me another one bag and the last time to give me another three as he’d been able to earn back the other bags through additional sales today."

You never had to partner up with someone you less than like in order to both get right?

I don’t miss it, been clean a minute, but that’s how it all works","I am less of a junkie these days.  I used today, but didn’t for a few days prior.  I am out of full blown active addiction, but I am still using here and there.

When I was a full blown junkie, of course I did things I’m not proud of.  I robbed tons of stores, stole cash here and there from various outlets/channels, but as I was a junkie myself and knew how much being sick sucked and how hard it was to get the cash I needed everyday, I never fucked over fellow junkies as I would never want to put another person in that situation.  I only stole from people and/or stores that I knew could afford it.

Oddly, during my junkie days, I was the most cautious I ever was when it came to people.  I was dealing with other junkies, dope dealers, and the general scum of the Earth.  If I didn’t like someone or had a bad feeling about someone, I’d steer clear of them, even if they offered to get me well, as I was worried about how they might try to leverage my situation, corrupt me, or take advantage of me."

Sometimes you get a dealer who means well, but also uses or lives with folks who use or both and shit gets desperate like it always does with this stuff.

I live in a VERY small town in BFE right now and there is one plug in the whole town who supplies the four or five street level dealers.  The four or five street level dealers sell half and quarter points for $10, but stepped on to all hell (first time I copped here was their shit, I was like 50+ days sober at the time I believe, I did a half gram and still wasn’t high, just not sick and sluggish).

We are somewhat close to the capital, though, where they have fire ECP stamps (ECP stamps that actually taste and smell like dog food).  In said capital, you can get buns for $30-40 as I understand it.  The main plug that provides to the street level guys goes to the capital, cops a few bricks, and brings it back and distributes to the street dudes for them to chop up and sell as they please.

My middle is said big plug’s cousin or brother or some shit.  He’s a junkie, but he is also the one with the actual connect in the capital.  As a result, he gets a free ride to the capital with the main plug and the main plug tosses him a bit each trip.

After each trip, my middle comes back with a few $30-40 buns (a little cheaper as he gets some tossed on for free) and then sells them to me uncut for $10/bag, but doesn’t cut them at all.  I get fire that I can actually get high off of as well as quasi-decent prices (especially for around here at least) and he makes a few shekels off of each bun and gets some bags to blast himself for free.

It’s a perfectly symbiotic relationship except when he decides to fuck me over even when I’m kind enough to front his ass."

6912,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"You have to have some landing gear after coke. Oxy, H, Xanax. Whatever. H is great if you're coming down from a binge, need to take the edge off and still be functional. Otherwise it's Xanax for sleep all the way."
6913,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,What do you guys think about wiping your ass after you take a shit? Like bruh seriously is there any other option? Lol just busting your balls. But I won't touch coke or crack without some dope and maybe a Xanax for when I'm done
6914,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"Yeah I always had to do morphine or H after coke or crack. I can’t stand the anxiety associated with the come down. I just wanna nod off and go to bed. Albeit I was never super fond of uppers in general, so it wasn’t a common thing for me. But i’ll never say no to drugs so.."
6915,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"Yes, this is extremely common.  A lot of wealthy professionals like tech and finance folks who get coked out or blast Adderall to work longer and make more often develop Opiate or Benzo addictions in an attempt to find a consistent come down."
6916,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"If I smoke rock without opiates/benzos/both then I’m in for a miserable borderline suicidal night.

If nothing else, clonidine works well and also high dose l-theanine (sublingual) is surprisingly effective at bringing my heart rate down and easing restlessness"
6917,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"Back in the day, at the height of my use I was doing a gram of dope and coke a day, sometimes 2. I would literally lay out 2 equal lines of each, them mix them into one big line, a sniff the whole thing lmao... I would then smoke crack a lil later. Damn I remember how amazing it all was. I'm basically clean now, no dope but the occasional oxy once every couple months."
6918,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"This is a requirement lmao. Although, since I’m a total fiend, requirement means “nice, but if I can’t make it happen still gonna get high and hate my life coming down without black lol.”"
6919,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,I hated coke without opiates to level it off and negate the come down. Literally dysphoric without them for me overall. No idea how people can binge on coke without something else. They are some tough mofos or something.
6920,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,Obv

You’ll just feel sick","That's unfortunate.  Codeine is actually a pretty good high for beginners at the ~150 mg level, provided you can convert 10% of it to morphine.  There are also supermetabolizers who can convert much more, leading to a potential overdose.  OP should proceed with caution and let others know what he/she is doing, just in case."

6926,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,Thankfully the plug ended up agreeing to fronting me two
6927,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"I have chase, and I’ve never been able to overdraw my checking account, unfortunately. 

Ive been in your shoes, and even tried “process as credit” for some cashback at a gas station, to no avail."
6928,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"only way I know of is at the gas pump, so, if someone needs 40.00 in gas, they can give you the cash and you can overdraft as the pumps only look for $1 on whatever card you try to use, not positive about ""Chase"" but every card I have had other than prepaid like Greendot worked this way."
6929,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"Unfortunately I don't think you can with Chase. I used to be able to with Bank of America but not anymore. This is not an immediate solution, but have you tried apps like Earnin'? It takes 1-3 days to process but if you have a job (or other source of income), direct deposit and a bank account (which it seems you have all those) you can get money fronted to you.

6934,Lol I used to overdraft my chase  account 800 bucks every 2 weeks,How would I go about getting just $40 out then?
6935,How would I go about getting just $40 out then?,"Set up debit card coverage. If you have a consistent paycheck theyll let you overdraw about as much as you get in direct deposit in my experience. Its a shitty trap though be warned as i was doing the same exact thing with the same bank youre using and you get caught in this cycle of ""ooh i got paid today! Fuck $400 of it went to overdraft fees"" then you get to the point of ""fuck i aint got enough money to take care of my financial obligations after those overdraft fees were taken out, guess i gotta overdraft it again"" then you are getting to the point where maybe one of your checks isnt as good as usual and it doesnt even let you break even on your account balance, thats where youre trapped because youll just be thinking ""idgaf if i overdraft my account i worked for this damn money and i cant last til my next payday on whatever paltry amount i have now"" trust me man think long and hard about this one because its a killer."
6936,How would I go about getting just $40 out then?,You have a second bank account?
6937,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"There isn’t really a *how* to it. You either can or you can’t. It could depend on the account you have. If you have a free checking acct., or if you have, like, a “plus” checking acct., or any acct. that offers benefits over a standard account. There’s usually a few different types the banks offer when you open your account. Mine, for example, has no overdraft fees and offers up to 1,500 cash advance. If you’re not eligible for a cash advance, the ATM will probably not let you withdrawal money you don’t have in there. You can try getting cash back, but again, depending on what your specific account allows, the transaction can still be denied due to insufficient funds. Good luck. 

An alternative, try requesting in r/borrow

If you’re not familiar with the sub: people request X amount of money, with a promise to pay back X amount plus an interest-like tip, on X date.
(i.e. requesting $40, will pay back $50 on 10/04/19)"

6939,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"If you have overdraft protection you can just buy something at a grocery store or Walmart and get cash back. There’s obvi a fee, but I’ve done it when I’m desperate."
6940,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,[deleted]
6941,[deleted],I tried to do it online in chase’ settings and it said I had no “eligible” overdraft accounts unfortunately.
6942,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"You can deposit a check at an atm with chase and receive up to $100 or $200 of that deposit immediately.  I would write a check from an old account sometimes when I was desperate and deposit it, take the money out immediately from the atm and it would be a full two days before they realized the check bounced.  By the time the check bounced, my direct deposit would hit to cover the overdraft.  Chase didn't care for this type of behavior one bit and cancelled my account the 2nd time I did it."
6943,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,Overdrafting ability is not specific to the bank you use it’s specific to the way your account was set up. When you opened it you either selected or it was pre-selected based on the product whether to allow the bank to process transactions that will result in an overdraft. Often times people will say no bc they don’t want to incur the fees associated if it happens via error or even to prevent it happening with fraud. If you have bad credit the checking product may have it disabled given they aren’t confident you would be able to repay the amount plus fees if they did process it. Unless you have an additional product called an overdraft line of credit then you will not be able to overdraft at an ATM for sure and most likely nowhere unless it runs just the preauthorization amount first before true amount like someone was mentioning with gas stations above. If it is rejecting it then that is a factor of product and account set up. Call the bank and ask for overdraft protection (also called overdraft line of credit some places) if you want to be able to overdraft in the future but realize your credit score will impact if they allow you to have this product.
6944,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,This is what fucked my credit up. I would just take a cash advance out on my credit cards and if end up never paying it back and before I knew it my cards were maxed

6970,Why does heroin give me so much energy?,"Very high quality tar gave me energy too when I was using. In all but super high doses. I had undiagnosed sleep issues though so that may have been part of it.

#3 to a small extent, and tar and opium to a greater extent, tend to have other non diacetylmorphine opiates present with some varying degrees of euphoria to respiratory depression to sedation to stimulation ratios. Tar in particular has high levels of 6-monoacetylmorphine which is the god-king of opiates as far as euphoria to other effects goes giving a stimulating effect. Appreciable in top tier tar no doubt.

Some people just react differently to opiates though. I got energy and euphoria and rarely nodded nor even enjoyed nodding. Others get the sedation and love that going as far as preferring fent and analogues with their low euphoria to respiratory depression and sedation ratios.

I'd say you are a lucky one in your reaction."

6981,Good way to dose fentanyl?,"Volumetric... Mix it with a certain amount of water, it will mix evenly in water, then you can measure out exact dosages, just make sure your math is right, ask on here if you need a double check."
6982,"Volumetric... Mix it with a certain amount of water, it will mix evenly in water, then you can measure out exact dosages, just make sure your math is right, ask on here if you need a double check.",This seems to be the safest method to accurately measure your dose. I've heard of people making this solution stronger and then putting it in a nasal spray bottle for ease of use and dose control.
6983,Good way to dose fentanyl?,32mg of sub a day? Jesus. I used to sprinkle fent on weed or tobacco and take very small hits. Id usually nod off and pass out after only a couple small puffs. Be very fucking careful.
6984,32mg of sub a day? Jesus. I used to sprinkle fent on weed or tobacco and take very small hits. Id usually nod off and pass out after only a couple small puffs. Be very fucking careful.,Yeah my doctor is very liberal with Suboxone. Most of the time i don't even take the full 32 or even 24.
6985,Good way to dose fentanyl?,"Smoke it on tin foil and take it one hit at a time. Easiest way to gauge the potency and not OD. I wouldn’t recommend snorting it, could do too much at once and that’s the end."

6991,Curiosity Killed the Sniffing Cat... why does so much #4 get stuck to the straw?,I always assumed because of static. I would usually just cut my straw open and scrape it out with a card to get the leftovers
6992,Curiosity Killed the Sniffing Cat... why does so much #4 get stuck to the straw?,Moisture and cuts that have a high caking ability
6993,Curiosity Killed the Sniffing Cat... why does so much #4 get stuck to the straw?,Static.
6994,Curiosity Killed the Sniffing Cat... why does so much #4 get stuck to the straw?,Instead of doing lines just take a scoop in the end of a straw and do it like a key bump. It doesn't travel through the straw so can't get stuck.

6997,"well, hydro is kinda weak compared to say oxy or something. tried two or 3 times before i realized it wasn’t doing much. that’s just my spin on it tho/based off experience",Yea I’ve done an M box and it smacked. I think the hydros aren’t for me.
6998,Tolerance(s)?,"Mbox = 30mg of oxy, which is equal to 45mg of hydro. If you took 5.5pills,thats 27.5mg, or a little over half what an Mbox would do for you.

I note you mentioned you've done mboxes before, so you may have some tolerance built up, depending on what your usage has been like.

CAUTION: Be careful about taking too many of those hydros, each one has 500mg of Acetaminophen. More than 4000/day is very bad for your liver, and you really shouldn't take more than 1000mg in a single sitting either. Hopefully you're not snorting these - Acetaminophen is not meant to be snorted. 

Not preaching, only informing. You do you, just wanted to be completely sure you had this info."

7028,"Oxycodone and NDRI, any interaction?",One will cancel out the other if the doses aren’t correct. What you’re doing is called a spotted ball. Be careful because the duration of the drugs are different so if you do too much of one it might kill you if you’re not habituated to it at higher doses. Just know that they’ll potentiate each other but at your dose it should be fine to mix Ritalin and Oxy. A friend of mine used to take Adderall and Oxy all the time and said it was one of the greatest pleasures ever. Long story short he has a really hard dependency to kick
7029,"Oxycodone and NDRI, any interaction?","No one has answered: if these drugs are legal medicines, you can call a pharmacy and ask them."
7030,"Oxycodone and NDRI, any interaction?",I am not familiar with the stims you're taking as I have never personally taken them but I love mixing coke or crack and any and all opiates as well as meth and any and all opiates. I don't see there being a huge difference but I'm also not a great scale as far as making decisions based on my actions. Im more of a fuck it let's see how this goes kind of guy.

7037,I meant why as in more intense? Longer? What’s worse about it not the scientific explanation,All of it. Why do you want to know?
7038,"Which one is worse, heroin WD or oxy WD?","Generally, assuming equivalent relative use between opiates, the longer the half life the worse the withdrawals. Short half life opiates will have somewhat more intense withdrawals in comparison, but last far less time. 

Heroin depends a lot on the actual product you have. Pure diacetylmorphine will have a moderate withdraw period and intensity, while diacetylmorphine cut with just fentanyl (mind you, more analogues change this) will have an intense period of withdrawal early thanks to the fent, and continue into to moderate duration and intensity via the diacetylmorphine.

Something like methadone and bupe have long enough half life's to push withdrawals into the weeks to month+ range. That's just straight up acute withdrawal, not even talking post acute withdrawal depression."

7080,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I have a theory on this. Many people say they loved weed before they got into opioids, but cant do it anymore.

What Ive noticed is this: when you smoke weed on a regular basis you get mellow stoned. When you smoke only on occasion, it is super intense and more of a mind-fuck.

When people get into dope, whether it be that they cant affford both (and dope wins), or whatever the reason, if you dont smoke more than twice a week its not gonna be the mollow ""stoned"" you remember, but an anxiety filled ride almost like a bad trip.

This is whats happening here and why dope users end up transitioning away from weed entirely..If you continue to smoke on a regular basis its sll good, they synergize very well together."

7083,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Just wait until they see what a square you look likr on the day all your connects get arrested or go out of town simultaneously...

I have noticed a lot of users quit when they FIRST get addicted. I did. I said the same as you -- weed was anxiogenic and I wanted to relax.

Well, as I got older and my addiction went on weed actually started to relieve the stress if my addiction to heroin. It became a great comfort during withdrawal, it allowed me to see my situation from the Birds eye view, and guess what??? From that perspective, a little dope sickness really AINT SHIT. And I can actually enjoy some goddamned music. Now, a lot of dope sickness (ie wd from a really big habit) really is shit, but it STILL isn't THAT bad, and it's still mostly just a bad flu if you keep the proper mentality (and a couple of subs, 10 Valium, and 20 400 mg gabapentin, along with the aforementioned cannabis doesn't hurt either).

Anyways... Bottom line, I do smoke herb again although I tend to smoke less during the worst parts of my addiction. Just smoking a little herb after being abstinent from it for a couple weeks tends to rein my use in, which is always a good thing. N

It makes me think twice about my use. In a good way.

Now, if I smoke TOO much, this self analysis can go too far and produce some anxiety or depression. But, that's just taking too much. Taking too much dope makes me, ya know, FUXKING DIE, so I just don't do that, and too much weed makes me anxious, so I just dont do that."

And yes, Lyrica and similar drugs like gabapentin definitely help with cravings. They just also have their own dependence and withdrawal.

An equivalent dosage to 8 mg of subs intranasal (or really any dose above like 4 to 8 sublingual or equivalent in other routes of administration, eg 3 to 6 mg intranasal) would be about 30 mg of methadone. Maybe 40. Subs don't ever really do much more than what 40 mg of methadone does.

Again, increasing your sub dose will not add much if any ""good"" opioid effects. There's a ceiling on it's activity at the mu receptor. Going up will either do nothing or give you a bigger dependence to subs other (sorta weird) effects without making you feel any better."

And the ""clean"" ones are on some other trip, like religion, or they're into pedophilia, they beat their wives and children, or they're just plain nasty people.

I found that out when i heard of addicts switching to spice because they weren’t suffering from opiate withdrawals as much as it was spice that was giving them terrible withdrawals.
7129,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Can’t think of any funny stories at the moment. But I was definitely the “square” or the “prude” of my group. I stopped smoking around 16/17 after being a heavy smoker for the last 3-4 years. I mean like a smoke tons of weed every day heavy user. For exactly the same reason as you. It made me extremely paranoid with awful anxiety. 

It was actually the group inside joke to ask me if I want to hit the bong whenever it’d go around. I also gave up drinking relatively young. And shortly after partying and all other drugs that weren’t opiates. And of course no one knew/knows I use(d) opiates. I was the tiny shy quiet naive innocent girl who was hopelessly in love with someone who didn’t love her back. (Jokes on him tho bc after waiting for 4 years we finally got together and are now engaged and together going 7 years strong)

Everyone pretty much thought I just got super serious about school but the truth is a really bad mushroom trip ruined all drugs for me. I’ve never been more scared except for the time my ex best friend OD’ed in my living room. After the bad trip I couldn’t be on anything that left me feeling ‘out of control/not completely in control of myself’.

Opiates specifically oxycodone hit that perfect sweet spot. I could get high and also feel super safe calm and in control of myself. I guess it’s usually the ones who appear the most innocent and put together that are really the ones with the darkest secrets."

I think the majority of us smoke pot. We do it because it gets us away from thinking about shit. I don’t mind small amounts of psychedelics now, but it does make you see things much more clearly. I’d prefer psychedelics over pot any day!"

I’m pretty introverted but I’m “cool” with everyone at my job, they are a bit younger, it’s wild to think I just turned 30, but my coworkers always smoke and ask me to join them and I just blame it on probation. I’m a pretty anxious person already and weed makes my anxiety and over analyzing everything go to a ten it’s so uncomfortable. This is common in opiate users I’ve come to find out over the years, people that used to smoke mad weed when they started using opiates, they started to hate weed. When you’re clean it’s even worse lol. Maybe it’s a chemical change in the brain or maybe we expect an opiate like high subconsciously and it’s something not even close. Who knows but I’m with you and I’m sure hundreds of people in this sub are too lol."
7133,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"yeah dude I've never really liked weed because of the anxiety it gives me (but it does improve my perception of music a lot, which is one aspect I appreciate). Before I became a daily dope user, I'd maybe do weed once in a while if I were really bored, but once my drug habit became serious, I would spend all my money on heroin and coke. I knew what kind of high I liked, so why sacrifice a bellringer or two just to get some weed? And now that I'm on methadone, I'm not supposed to test positive for thc if I want take-homes. 

Psychedelics were the first drugs I ever did and I really appreciate my experiences on them, but absolutely none of them were 'fun' or totally enjoyable, barring maybe the time I did DMT (took a xanax beforehand, but also it was so intense an experience, I couldn't get caught up in anxious thoughts-- I was too busy just being strapped in for the ride). 

I had a similar experience to you in college. Definitely was assumed to be a teetotaller because I didn't drink or partake in any visible drug use of any kind (although I would have if I knew more people at my college who used harder drugs). There was an arrogance and also an insecurity/anxiety behind it though. Anyway, that was a few years ago. Managed to hide my dope habit throughout 2 years as a data engineer in silicon valley, until I began speedballing, which made me spectacularly implode in a matter of months."
7134,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Used to be me, but now being on benzos, weed is super nice. No anxiety and i know my limits. can always smoke more but cant undo too much if you catch my drift. like a weed OD except it’s not fatal, you just puke for a couple hours and that aint fun"
7135,Anybody else not smoke weed?,Fucking hate smokin pot
7136,Anybody else not smoke weed?,For me the opiate high no matter dose or route of administration always is underwhelming but still nice. However I won't indulge in opiates without weed but I am a heavy cannabis user who could smoke back to back gram blunts of the loudest loud. When combined however opiates are quite a profound high I must admit.

7138,Anybody else not smoke weed?,I smoke now and then. I can handle the nervous breakdown it gives me. But if I'm around others I will usually double my daily dose of kpins. Then weed is like total bliss. Then sleep.
7139,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Its called a functioning addict. Lol. 

But yeah same. Couldnt smoke it would make me anxious."
7140,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Heroin helped me quit weed. I’m gonna try medical marijuana pills, I mainly just hate smoking but need some kind of pain relief stronger than Tylenol. Can’t touch my opibabies any more, slightest use and I’m on a run with the worst withdrawals after four hours."
7141,Anybody else not smoke weed?,Yeah weed gives me hella anxiety. Lady says to smoke indica but any strain trips me up. On probation too...
7142,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I usually say “I don’t smoke weed anymore”, or “I don’t like being around people when I smoke weed” or something that makes it clear that I’m chill but weed just gets too freaky for me to be around people but I don’t mind chilling with people when they smoke, because weed is a “gateway drug” only in the sense that many people use it to check if you’re chill with drugs and I don’t like missing out on the other stuff. Most people who actually know me are like wtf when the find out I don’t smoke cuz I’ll do a shot of meth, heroin and pcp but somebody offers me a joint and I’m like HELL NAH BOI I ain’t tryna die today lmao"

7144,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Weed is such a boring drug. I've tried it around 5-6 times and it just didn't really do anything for me, though I suppose with such high standards as opiates nothing is really comparable. 

I used to be a heavy alcohol drinker too before having touched opiates, and now I can't stand alcohol. Tried a few different psychedelics and MDA and was also not that much of a fan, usually don't care for uppers at all with the only exception being coke, and even then I'm eh. 

Unless it's an opiate, benzo or ketamine I don't really care that much for it."
7145,Anybody else not smoke weed?,Yeah no I’m not a weed person I used to smoke everyday but quit for about 5 years last year I hit like a little one hitter of some medical shit. Let me tell you that I was praying to god not to let me die  the shit they got now it too damn potent I just can’t do it anymore
7146,Anybody else not smoke weed?,I used to shoot heroin before going to class in college.
7147,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Weed's the only way I'm able to eat and keep food down, due to some undiagnosed motility issue. If I don't have any green to calm my nausea and ensure the food moves from my stomach to my bowels, then hours after I eat -- when the stomach should normally already be empty again -- I'll vomit back up _everything_ I'd eaten since the last time I threw up. In the past I've lost up to 30lbs in a few weeks and become grossly dehydrated and malnourished, to the point that my skin was flaking off and my hair was falling out. 
But yeah, in the end I'm just thankful that you guys _have_ and can take the option to not smoke weed. 

Granted, I'm not complaining _too much_ about it being something _I need,_ because I always have enjoyed a nice bowl every now and then, even before I got sick, but it starts to weigh on you when you realise you're no longer just getting high _for fun,_ and it gets expensive needing to smoke any time I eat, and I'm not financially stable enough to really continue this way; I am grateful to be relying on a natural drug as opposed to shit the Pharma shills try to get me hooked on so I'm drawn into their vortex of addiction, dependence and enabling, though. 

Another nice little positive to the whole thing is that it's gotten so much easier to obtain than it used to be (especially for a socially awkward nobody who lives out in the middle of Buttfuck Nowhere, Manitoba, Canada and doesn't know _any_ dealers personally and had to rely on another pothead to contact her dealer for me; she was a toxic, shady as fuck, _dirty ass lying whore of a ""friend""_ and _you know_ she never let me forget or live any of the times when I'd ask her to pick up for me down -- not that she'd ever _let me_ stop using her as a middle-man anyway, since she'd lose her ability to steal money and weed from me at every chance [sorry for the rant, it's a bit of a sore spot >.<]) since Canada rolled out the big okay for recreational marijuana and opened up dispensaries everywhere -- now there's one twenty minutes away where I can talk to super knowledgeable employees about what strains suit me best and I know if I find a good one I can rely on them to still be carrying it next time I'm there; not like when I was buying unreliable ditch weed from friend-of-a-friend dealers, where you have no idea where it's coming from, if you'll ever be able to get it again, the conditions it was grown in, if the dealer likes you enough to sell to you again or even _what strain you were just sold!_"
7148,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"After I started dope, I could not smoke pot. I found that out on New Years a few years back...I took one good puff and had to sit and wait for everyone to be distracted so I could crawl off and find a place to lie down.

7152,Anybody else not smoke weed?,Weed only gives me anxiety if I'm shooting H. It makes me think about the damage I'm doing to my body and I can convince myself I fucked my heart up from injecting. If I'm not on opiates weed is my best friend.
7153,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Weed saved me from opiates. I used to get anxious when using heroin, pills and all, and then smoking on top of that. Now I only smoke weed and it's chill and better than the fog and stress and cravings from opiates.

I know this was not your question, but I felt the need to weigh in."
7154,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Was a pothead throughout my teens, but much like OP and others here, paranoia, anxiety, etc. ruined it for me. 

The one exception I've discovered were some 100% Indica (pretty sure it was Indica, anyways), 10mg gummies that were recommended by a friend of mine that works for a large edibles company in Colorado, and were among the goodies a group of mutual friends brought back after their 4-20 vacation. 

None of the negatives, just a nice, ~6 hour, full body high. The best, and totally unexpected, aspect of the experience was the complete lack of cravings for dope. Would love to stock up on those bad boys."
7155,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I know sooooo many heroin addicts who won’t smoke weed bc it makes them paranoid... like it’s this very common thing. I feel the EXACT same way- will not touch weed, unless it’s shake, I’m alone, in front of a tv, with copious amounts of food. 

The weird thing is a smoked a shit ton of weed til I was 23/24. Then boom, all of a sudden it’s the worst thing ever."
7156,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I would smoke a little when I was using fent but after I quit fent I got addicted to weed and got high literally any time I possibly could. Now my tolerance to weed is so high that I have to quit for a while. I don’t get high from any amount of weed, edibles, dabs, etc I just can’t get high. My vision gets different and I feel it in my body but I just don’t get high at all. For some reason I’ve never had any anxiety or bad highs from weed, so it was really easy to become dependent on it after fent"

The husband is over checking the plants all the time.  He says they look good.  His wife is paralyzed in a wheelchair and had the cancer but they both smoke it.  He had knees and hips done.   Its amazing the ambition he still has (more than me!!)  He does get pain pills but doesn't take them. He has one old friend that knows when he is supposed to get the script and shines around only to freeload the pills.  Last month my neighbor said, ""fuck off (name)!""  Lmao.  Anyway, this couple is like family to me, I just LOVE them.  Actually the entire block is all old guys that smoke.  My dad is 74 and smokes too.

Now with heroin I see people all over this thread freaking out if I say something. Ad about it. Y'all all know you are playing a game with life and death every time you shoot up. Maybe your friends freak out you dont smoke weed because you do heavy drugs. Maybe they dont want you to die and they freak out to smoke weed because the chances of dying from a joint is a lot less likely than sticking a needle with some heroin into your veins.

That’s when you know you gotta take it easy. It will be obvious. Although you’ll probably be alright, snorting opioids is relatively easy on the nose compared to more caustic chemicals like meth. 

About the boofing inconsistencies, if it didn’t work the boofer might have done it wrong or they had a giant shit in their pipes blocking absorption or something.

I want to also stress that a minute after snorting, wet your fingers with some water or get a little water cupped in your hand and lean your head back and snort a tiny amount of water. It will help with the drying out of your nostrils and make you feel a little better but it will also help break down any powder stuck to some boogers or whatever since what you’re snorting is water soluble"

7216,How much for withdrawals?,"I suggest Red Bali strain. 


Depends on how much H you've been using. Could take quite a lot of kratom for some people. Takes me around 7-10 grams to feel like im not dying."
7217,is a low flame better to smoke off foil ?(Heroin#3),Yes. You should vaporize and not burn it.
7218,is a low flame better to smoke off foil ?(Heroin#3),"It's really difficult to describe without seeing. You want it at an angle so when it's heated and liquifies it runs and makes a trail. Its way better to angle it too steep then too flat. If it's angled too steep the worst that can happen is a hit or two are left on the trail and you can just go back over those spots. If it's too flat it's like a frying pan, it just Burns and bubbles and doesn't run. As for the flame I've always preferred a bic lighter, and only touching the foil with the tip of the flame. 

TL:DR - 45° is generally ideal, but it's better to angle it too much than too little"
7219,"Haven't been withdrawaling like I have in the past, but why?",I wonder if you have something with a really long half life and you haven't really hit the shit yet. I hope I'm wrong. I hope your withdrawals are as easy as possible. But a lot of these chemicals are really weird and I've seen posts where people don't go into withdrawal until 3 or 4 days later.  So just have whatever comfort meds you would normally need just in case

Because I've been withdrawaling but nothing like it has been in the past just like you! Sometimes I want to quite and only do it once a week but the real reason I don't is because I'm so freaking scared of the withdrawal. But if this comes without cold sweats I have nothing to fear.

7237,Ah that's really interesting....I've never had someone say that's the worst part. It must be severe for you,It’s just the thing that leads to insomnia for me at least.

7241,Can you split OxyContin 80?,Just cut it and chew up half
7242,Just cut it and chew up half,You don’t think it’s kinda dangerous to split em tho ?
7243,You don’t think it’s kinda dangerous to split em tho ?,"If you are only taking half, think of it as taking 40 mg of instant release oxy. So if you normally take 30, this would be like taking 10 more. It's going to hit you slower though. What kind do you have? Like what markings are on the pill"

7245,Green OP 80,"Ok, the OP are the hardest to ""make instant release"".  You could cut this in half and take it and it would still be like taking an extended release pill. The extended release is distributed throughout the pill, it's not just a coating. You'll find that when you go to cut it, it's extremely hard so a pill cutter really is the best way to do it. If I was you I would cut it up into really tiny pieces and parachute it or you can try to chew it up but it's really rubbery. These are the ones that people say to drop in a small glass of Coca-Cola overnight and that breaks the instant release mechanism. With the theory being that it's an acidic solution so it's like sitting in your stomach so the oxy is released. I've done it a few times and it does feel like an instant release pill but I don't know if you wanna weigh 8 hours lol. So your best bet is to chew it up and like I said that would be like taking 40 mg of oxy because that's exactly how much it is"

7247,I’ve read that splitting the actual pill causes the “extended release effect” to not happen and people can OD more off of it because it hits faster? True? Or myth?,"40 mg of oxy is 40 mg of oxy. You don't magically make it more by cutting it up. If you have no tolerance then yeah, I guess making it instant release would be more dangerous. But everybody on here is trying to break that extended release mechanism lol. If you are normally taking instant release pills these are going to feel different. They're not gonna hit as hard or as fast"
7248,You don’t think it’s kinda dangerous to split em tho ?,No
7249,Can you split OxyContin 80?,"Splitting isn’t dangerous.  Dual polymer matrix woven into the shit so the time release is all up in the white shit inside too.  If you want to ER them, you need to chew or dissolve them.  If you cut one in half and then swallow, it will be ER still."
7250,"I was about to inject an OC-40, so wold 1ml of water be enough for the oxy to dissolve in the liquid?","the rigs ur probably using, should be anyway are likely 1ml

It could be an allergic reaction like people are saying, you could try taking 25 mg or 50 mg of Benadryl before next time. If you're snorting it, it could be irritating your sinuses. Your sinuses are connected all throughout your head to your ears and eyes. If it's irritating your sinuses you may not necessarily feel it in your nose. It might be backing it up into your eyes as well. After and before you snort you could irrigate with saline (dont irrigate after until you've already begun to feel the effects).

7295,In your experience did you feel high for the full 12 hours?,"If your tolerance is truly low, you're much better off splitting it into 2-4 pieces and taking those a few hours apart.

You're likely to get sick and puke if you pop a whole ER 80 with a really low tolerance.

And to answer your question, I'd say the high lasts around 3-6 hours, but again it depends on your tolerance a lot."
7296,In your experience did you feel high for the full 12 hours?,I don't know much about extended release other than the fact that it releases x amount per hour but in my opinion man if you are not opiate tolerant I most certainly would not be taking the entire 80. If someone with more knowledge than me could enlighten me I would greatly appreciate it but whether it's instant release or extended release if you haven't been doing this s*** for a while I think taking the whole 80 would be a bad idea.

Then draw everything from the filter back to your rig. In the meantime while you order quality filters try going back to the organic cottons or use a piece of a cig filter, a big enough piece of whatever to absorb as much as possible, then draw back up thru the filter. You won't necessarily get you entire shot drawn the first pull so just get the air out and keep drawing until you get it all. You can use your cap to squeeze out excess solution from the filter then pull that up thru the filter with needle in the filter. Hope that makes sense. You'll get it dude just keep trying and asking questions. ✌️"

Thanks again!
7320,Help with drawing up — when you use a cotton as a filter; is it normal normal to draw up maybe 10-20 units less than you squirted onto your dope?,"I always put the cotton through my needle first, and then put it into the liquid to draw it up, but if you heat your shit up you may be dissolving some of the water.

Usually after I draw it up though, I gently squish the cotton with my fingers while pulling back the plunger and I can usually get a good amount extra by doing this, but be careful you don’t break ur needle by pinching the cotton"

And nice! Keep it that way and keep her! I hope it works out well for you! And damn, we're in the same boat, all except this is my 2nd time going through it with my Mrs. And there's no way I'm throwing it away either. There is not one thing that will stop me from showing her that she means more than a devil drug, or anything else for that matter. And that's the thing with this drug too! Most of the people that use are actually nice people, hearts of gold! I like to think I'm one of them. And the same as you, I like to think that my Mrs can see that in me. And to be fair, mine and yours must see it!! They wouldn't have stuck around else... 

Are your drug tests random, or? I used to smoke a LOT of weed, but haven't smoke it for nearly a decade! I tried to smoke it a few months ago, and fuck...!! Weed has been engineered to be so much more potent than I ever remember... I ended up in the hospital, tripping balls and not breathing properly... needless to say, I won't be touching that again, ahaha! I shouldn't even be smoking gear, as 2 years ago, just before Christmas, I run the lighter too close to the foil and blew half of my lung due to the heat! Apparently, lungs are like pockets of grapes, my left lung now is half grape and half tennis ball. Been told not to go scuba diving as the pressure could pop the tennis ball area and cause my lung to rupture/collapse... I also need to stop the cigarettes too. Been smoking for 22 years now, with a 2 month gap back in 2010 after a mini-stroke I had 🙄

And I love that feeling!! The feeling of being clean which comes with that feeling of actually being awake for the first time in... Fuck knows how long!! Its like you've been emotionally disconnected through all the using. You don't notice at the time, as when you're using, you're just numb to everything and think that's 'normal'... But finally waking up! Fuck, I love that feeling!! Its so much better than the high from H, a thousand times better! Awake, a clear head and the energy to even feel just a little motivated... I want that soooooo bad! That and the thought of my Mrs wanting to stay with me... Nothing could ever ruin that, which is why I know I'm going to be free of this shit very, VERY soon.

And I know that feeling only too well!! My Mrs is the same, she won't try to mould me in to the person she wants to be with, she takes me for me and loves me all the same. Which in turn, just makes me want to be a better person for her, to be the person she deserves! Because all the lies and shit that I've fed her these last few months... She deserves sooo much more than that and so much more. I don't think I'll ever be able to say ""that's enough, I've repaid her to what she deserves"", because she'll always be worth more than anyone could give! And you're right! Theres a very big difference! 

Also, I know my Mrs. Loves me, even through all the shit I've put her through. Our first date... I met her on PlentyOfFish(don't know if you have that over there, it's a dating site). We talked on the phone and Skype for a few months. I finally took the dive and drove for an hour and a half to meet her. Our first date consisted of us just chatting shit in her living room, getting a dominoes pizza, 2 beers each... Then we fell asleep on her sofa while having a cuddle and still chatting shit! ahaha!! 😂 in my eyes, it's the best date I've ever been on or heard of, lol. And that date was nearly 5 years ago now!

Just take it slow and see if you get drowsier than normal?

My vitals are all very normal when I’ve gone to the doctor on these high doses. Everyone is different but I wouldn’t be that concerned."

Hell, I go to the dentist for a root canal and they offer me twelve of them if I’m hurting afterwards, I usually decline them though because I’m off opiates now. There has definitely been a push to keep teens and young adults from any opiates because that’s your primary age where people get turned on to opiates and eventually addicted, it is less likely for people to become addicted as they age. In addition, it’s also more likely for people to age out of addiction if they survive that long. It’s not a rule or anything though."

For the longest I was functioning getting great grades and everything was working out. People would not relate my drug addiction as a problem because it wasn't affecting my every day life. I wish I had someone to say you are a fucking dumbass for continuing to do this shit. I ultimately had to tell myself this because that's ultimately the only person who cared enough. I was selling just about anything so I could buy my drugs and this alone is bad. I was buying praz from black web and pressing xans. One day I ate about 100 xans and blacked out for a few days. Than my dealer offered me a huge bag of fent to press blues. That was the day I decided to quit because I realized how many people would be dying from that shit. It's no way to properly make a blue with fent in your house but people do it anyways. And everyone in this thread knows that and continue to put their life at risk. Anyone who dies from this shit I feel for I really do because I know it isn't easy to quit. But they know the possibilities of buying fake pills that are pressed. They also know they dont wanna feel dope sick when they cant get their clean pills so they'll be okay buying a fake one because hey maybe it will work and you won't die  but I'd rather not take the risk as it seems stupid. If you need drugs to not feel bad about yourself you are caught in a terrible circle. Once you clean up it takes awhile to even start feeling normal again. That's even after the sickness pass.

It instantly helped me and reading it's benefits it sounds too good 2 b true🖖","Thank you for your insight brotha man I’m almost 20 and been using coke and opioids since I was 15 years old but didn’t try heroin/fentadope until 17 and didn’t get heavily into them until I was 18 (with coke/crack which I rarely smoke now) and a few months ago with fentadope.

 I don’t even get huge euphoria out of coke like I used to unless I smoke or IV it but I still enjoy the fuck out of it and use it everyday and after 8 days of using my diluted fent I wasn’t even able to catch nods at all until I recently found someone with a H/fet mix that makes me nod my tits off. 

Luckily I for some odd reason don’t get very bad comedowns from coke (very high quality btw) and when I don’t have opioids I don’t seem to get sick at all. I’m very grateful for this but I know it won’t stay that way forever"

Coke to me isn’t much of a stimulant in the way that amphetamines are, but more of a euphoriant. In my experience with high purity cocaine, a true coke high is oddly chill and feels very mentally uplifting and talkative. In a sense it’s like an opioid without the sedation or analgesia, but the euphoria and ego boost are still present. 

On the other hand and in my experience, amphetamines are less euphoric than coke (with the exception of MDMA) but they are much more true to the word “stimulant”‘ than yayo is. I get a more adrenaliney, productive high from amphetamines, one that makes mundane tasks much more enjoyable to do, compared to how when I’m on coke all I want to do is focus on the euphoria. 

A way I describe their differences to my less experienced friends is that the amphetamine class of drugs makes doing things feel good, and cocaine makes you feel good to be doing nothing. Unless I am socializing or doing something else that I already find enjoyable, other things can feel as if they are distracting me from honing in on my coke buzz."

7447,I have similar issues with the current shit that is masquerading as dope these days.,I just don’t understand because what I’ve been using is most definitely an opioid
7448,I don’t get fentadope withdrawals?,"2 things: 

#1. Yeah it does take a long time to get physical wd when you first start 

#2. If you havent had opiate wd before, it sounds like you're already getting the beginnings, you probably just dont know it well enough yet.

The type of person who finds that they can't live without them after a taste is generally someone who is going through life with unresolvable mental distress.

I went to the dentist for 2 months straight and I finally got prescribed Tylenol 3's then Norco shortly after.

7470,Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with recreational use of opiates?,Yes but it can be challenging.

I still like to use now and then because...well the opiate high is great lmao. Real hard to keep it in check though, gets out of hand now and then so I need to take breaks."
7472,Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with recreational use of opiates?,I get by with doing opiates about once a month. I crave them everyday but I can control it.
7473,Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with recreational use of opiates?,Ohh yes I am a recreational user .. You could say.. Yes they are addictive and I once was addicted but got clean years ago and now I occasionally use every couple months on a vacation or visiting my family up north.  I will get a couple and do them for a couple days 3-4 days have a good time then I get back home and dont use got months at a time. I have cravings hereand there but I don't feel them out or buy them where I live .. I hsve some fun.. Then go back home to sober living.

I've been on both sides and I understand that showing that you're not a pushover is what dealers have to do but shouting at people for no reason is stupid, nobody should give it if they can't take it.

Drop him if that's how it is, I'm sure he'll miss your money."

I’m the only one that he serves and let’s chill at his house now. I even know his mom well. He even gave me his phones when he went out and his big sack.

Of course / ive given him a car to use a few times. Loaned him some cash to re up once. cash app when he was out of town and ran low on vacation.

I also probably do not look like a normal junkie. I use every other quarter.  So I don’t run low on funds and just as I get to the end of the quarter I usually do something stupid lol. I’ve been doing that for 6 years now. Same dboy majority of the time."

Also I think PRE-084 is a sigma receptor agonist that's chemically related to PCP.

And O-DSMT is the opioid metabolite of Tramadol so it cuts out having to be a good CYP2D6 metabolizer to get good effects out of it. It's about as strong as Hydrocodone so if you have a tolerance it won't cut it but it's a good alternative for the opioid naive."

7633,"Most meds just lose potency over time. A few can be toxic, I believe Aspirin is one that will.",Yeah I’d be more worried about the expired apap than the narcotic 😷

7635,Is 6 years expired Hydrocodone 7.5mg/Acetaminophen 325mg safe to take?,I found some Xanax from like 2012 in a jacket pocket it was for like a airplane ride or something for a family member and they didn’t even take one but I ended up taking some and they put me on my ass so I’d say ur good to go.

Seemed more potent. I talked to a pharmacist and they tried to say it wasnt recommended but it totally works fine
7637,Is 6 years expired Hydrocodone 7.5mg/Acetaminophen 325mg safe to take?,"Yes pills don’t really expire to be honest,may loose a little potency"
7638,"Yes pills don’t really expire to be honest,may loose a little potency",Yeah I found a study that suggested this I might link it for people looking this up in the future.
7639,What kind of withdrawals should I expect?,"Opiate withdrawals are extremely mental.

If you fully commit and, better yet, situate yourself so you literally cannot use for a week, it's so much easier than if you sit at home debating whether to use or not.

So if you're gonna do it, tie yourself to the mast, delete the numbers from the phone and have someone delete them from your google accounts, give your phone to a friend if necessary, go out of town if possible...

It is seriously so mental. 

You'd probably barely get sick at all if you knew it was literally impossible to use.

Also, gabapentin or pregabalin are your friends."

7641,I agree it is very mental but the physical part is very very real,"There are real physical withdrawals that are not mental in any way.

But, eg, it's a fact that someone detoxing at home when they know they CAN get it and WANT to get it, eg because they need to pass a pee test, will get sicker than someone who is in jail, or who is in a rehab in the middle of nowhere without the funds to get home or even to a city to cop.

I've experienced it and I've heard the story repeatedly.

Last guy told me he did 6 days in jail. On day 6 he was feeling better coming off of dope. Then he finds out he's getting bailed out. IMMEDIATELY he is sweating and getting hot and cold, etc, all ways for that scumbag addict part of his brain to remind him to go use.

All those symptoms that had ended were brought back the moment he heard he would be free and have the opportunity to use. Like his addict neurons wanted to make sure he remembered to use dope even though he had objectively already finished (mostly, was getting was better) withdrawal a day earlier and was sleeping and eating and felt he had a normal temperature.

It's like that for me. At home, I'm a mess. At rehab, I don't feel GREAT by any means, but I sleep (just less) and I feel tired and chilly, versus at home where my body feels like its trying too force me to use."
7642,What kind of withdrawals should I expect?,That isn’t such a terrible habit compared to other’s. Just stay hydrated and get some rest while you can and you’ll be fine. Plus the job will hopefully be interesting enough to help keep cravings at bay. Good luck
7643,That isn’t such a terrible habit compared to other’s. Just stay hydrated and get some rest while you can and you’ll be fine. Plus the job will hopefully be interesting enough to help keep cravings at bay. Good luck,"Yea that’s kinda what I was thinking and hoping. Most I do would probably be a .3 but that’s rare. Just curious as to how it works because I know when I couldn’t get pills or just didn’t take em I damn near wanted to die. After about 24-30ish hours after a line or two of H, the back and joint pains start and the chills kick in. Shortly after that the sweats come but I’ve never really pushed it past that before dosing again."
7644,What kind of withdrawals should I expect?,Hydrocodone or hydromophone? If you have the option I would never cold turkey it why put yourself through the misery if you don’t have to...Can you get suboxone? If you can look up the burnese method I’ve done it a few times and it’s a life saver
7645,Hydrocodone or hydromophone? If you have the option I would never cold turkey it why put yourself through the misery if you don’t have to...Can you get suboxone? If you can look up the burnese method I’ve done it a few times and it’s a life saver,Went from hydrocodone to oxy to h. Subs aren’t an option as I’m on probation and I’m not sure how that would work out.
7646,Went from hydrocodone to oxy to h. Subs aren’t an option as I’m on probation and I’m not sure how that would work out.,Why aren’t subs an option? For a drug test? You’re still using other drugs so I’m not understanding why you’re worried about subs and not the other shit?
7647,Why aren’t subs an option? For a drug test? You’re still using other drugs so I’m not understanding why you’re worried about subs and not the other shit?,"I think he’s saying that the subs won’t work for probation because they stay in the body for a lot longer? Like with H/pills, after about 3-7 days of no use, it’s out of the body and won’t show on a drug test, but subs can show on a drug test like a week+ after stopping. I could be wrong about that, but that’s about the only reason I could see someone saying that subs aren’t an option in this situation."

They are trying to phase out opiates for cancer patients. Let that one sink in. There are people out there in much more intense pain than me, and I'm miserable. And they are fucking trying to phase them out? When you 1st walk into the cancer institute where I go, there's pamphlets everywhere. One of them is on pain control without opiates. That's as soon as you walk in the damn door. If you're there in intense pain, and you don't really know how to talk to doctors, and then you see that… what are you going to think? Are you still going to advocate for your own pain control? I had to go to my primary care physician because she knows me well.

7718,Is doing opiates even really worth it anymore?,"Dude, these are the days where literally anyone with money, an address, some research using modest reading comprehension skills, some minor tech skills, a bit of market research and some patience can get high quality dope delivered to them in bulk at a good price. The slightly smarter and more patient ones will source a few samples and send them in for analysis to get exact compositions of active components and then source a large bulk order off that and be set for a long time.

You can not move from your desk and have a half pound of 60-95% diacetylmorphine at your door in as little as 48 hours in most countries and less than 24 in some.

Yeah the average ignorant user won't do this and will be subject to the garbage of the present market, but you don't have to be the average ignorant. You could even profit off them and they will thank you for it and be safer.

7731,Any of you guys ever sold blood plasma for drug money? What was your experience,"I used to donate plasma at OctaPpasma all the time, and it was usually a pleasant enough experience. The only thing that I didnt like was when they were busy and I had to wait forever till it was my turn, because the actual process took about an hour too. 

They dont drug test you, but you do get a little physical when you first sign up. The first time you donate they send your blood to a lab to test for HIV and a few other things. They also check your vitals everytime and check your plasma levels before hand and if you're too low they tell you to come back the next day. Some people like to go to different places to try to get more money because they only let you donate 2 times a week. They do have you show your arms during the vital check every time and they look for track marks, so if you shoot and have marks they might turn you away. They have a little kiosk with a touch screen computer that you answer the same 20 something questions every time you go. They ask things like if you have been sick since the last visit, been out if the country, gotten a tattoo, paid for sex, live with someone that has HIV, hepatitis, things like that.

The process isnt too bad. I dont shoot up, but I dont really have a problem with the big ass needle they use. It just takes a while because they take your blood, it runs in a machine that separates the red cells from the plasma, then it sends your red cells back into your arm. It does this probably 5 or six times until the bottle is full of plasma, then there's a bag of saline that it pushes into your vein to kind of rehydrate your blood since they took all that plasma out. Like I said the process takes about an hour. Yoire sitting/laying in a comfy chair thing so you're comfortable. They have TVs and wifi. You're allowed to watch stuff and text on your phone, you just cant talk on your phone. 

The money is decent too. At the place I went to you get $75 for your first donation. After that they have a system where you get $25 on your first visit of the week and $50 on your second. Plus they always have special promotions going on. It's either an extra $20 for your 2nd donation of the week. Or they base it on your total donations for the month and you can only do 8 a month since its max 2x a week. Like an extra $25 on your 6th, $30 on your 7th, and $50 on your 8th. Its Definitely worth it of you have nothing else to do and have spare time. You're also helping to save lives and create new medicines. 

Unfortunately they dont give you cash. They give you a prepaid debit card that you have to use and keep track of because they reload the same card everytime you donate. Once the guy in the back scans your plasma bottle the money gets put in your account. It was usually on there by 30 mins after I was done. The card isnt too bad because you can get cash back with it. I would go to publix and buy a soda then get the rest of the $ in cash back since you can pick exact amounts of cash back at publix. 

Sorry for the book I just wrote. Lol. I just have some experience with it, so I figured I'd tell you how it was for me. If you have any more questions, just ask and I'll answer them if I know."
7732,"I used to donate plasma at OctaPpasma all the time, and it was usually a pleasant enough experience. The only thing that I didnt like was when they were busy and I had to wait forever till it was my turn, because the actual process took about an hour too. 

They dont drug test you, but you do get a little physical when you first sign up. The first time you donate they send your blood to a lab to test for HIV and a few other things.

The paperwork to start was a fucking hassle, they needed so much documentation. Its some kind of a government operated facility. Don't expect to go in and get started right away, itll take about 2 weeks to begin donating. Its not painful after they poke you, and they usually have pretty comfy seating. The first 3 times is good pay but then it slowly decreases to about 20$ every donation. You can only donate 2 times every 7 days. They give you a card that has your money loaded on it. Good luck!"

It doesn't block anything so if you are still feeling the effects of the kratom you will get higher than normal when you do the blue so maybe do a half and see how u feel

7753,Addict or drug dependent?,"Ask them if they also deny evolution or vaccines, because mainstream science has clearly defined the difference between drug dependency and addiction for a long time now."
7754,Addict or drug dependent?,"In my opinion yes you are no different than me. I sniffed oc oxys starting in the mid 2000s then opanas then dope then iv dope. When i am going to a doctor to get a script for subs, does that somehow make me not an addict while im taking my sub script? Somehow going from buying pills and dope to paying a doctor hundreds for a script of subs or methadone would change you from an addict into just dependent by your logic?  There is no difference imom

Sure you get your dope from a pharmacy but ive met so many people that got hurt bad, got on cpp, then out of nowhere they get cut off.  What would you do if you took your last pill, went to your doctor appointment and either the place was closed with a paper on the door saying ""the doctor got arrested/shut down and sorry for the inconvenience"", or you get inside into a room and the doc comes in and says ""sorry. Heres the numbers for the local methadone clinic. Good luck"" ? 

Would you just shrug your shoulders and go home with no meds and be fine with nothing or maybe spend weeks trying to get into another cpp doctor, only to get in and he says hell give you tramadol or 3- 5mg hydrocodone per day?  Youd be sick as fuck for a week then feel like garbage with no energy for months and months without a script

The last detox i was at there was a ~40year old woman that was in a bad car crash and had full dentures from knocking her teeth out. She got oxy 30s for a long time then out of nowhere the doc gives her the numbers for methadone clinics so she ended up doin dope.

Sure opiates work for pain at first, but with longer use at the same dose, all it does is make you feel normal. Now im not trying to put oxy users down, but even with way stronger opiates like opana and heroin dope, after 20 years theres increasingly diminished effects that i could shoot 2 grams of good dope and id still get better pain relief from tylenol/motrin. My tolerance back in 2010 was 40mg opana per day sniffed and one day i was sick and my friends mom had a few bottles of perk5s unused so i took 16 of em and it didnt even stop the wds and that was a decade ago. I just cant see anyone legitimately taking ~100mg of oxycodone per day for 5-10-20+ years and still be affected by that same dose. After a few months of the same dose all it does is get you dope sick wothout it and when you take it all it does is make you feel unsick.

I guess if it makes you feel better to think youre different cause you get it from a pharmacy then go ahead and keep thinking that way, but you said you already take extra doses to feel good so just that already means you like the high from opiates and that your prescribed dose doesnt do much for you anymore.

Best wishes.","I meant no offense. That's just my opinion on the subject.  I just know that they don't do shit for pain after awhile. They actually make it worse. Your body develops a tolerance by making more opiate receptors in the Brain to handle more n more opiates, then when you don't have that same dose you now are more sensitive to pain.

Opiates change our brain. We will rationalize to make it ok to do the drug.   So basically if you take 80mg oxycontin twice a day, eventually you'll stop feeling That same 80mg dose.

  Now obviously if every day you wake up and take an 80mg oxycontin at 8am then 8pm every day, you'll wake up feeling a little bit dopesick, then take the 80oxy, youre going to feel better.  But instead of getting high you just go from sick(negative high) to feeling normal like ur basically just sober and then you would need to start taking more than 80mg to get the high.  And obviously this isnt scientific, its just a very simple explanation of how taking the same dose eventually just gets you to normal and youd then need to take over 80mg to start getting high from it"

I guess because it's a normal part of my daily life I don't put thought into it these days. I absolutely feel like they dont work as well for pain but I am moderate in my usage. Thank you. It isnt because in trying to get high that I take extra, it's because I have days i can hardly care for myself due to pain. Those days i say fuck it and hope for a better day ahead. The meds arent my only form of pain management but just about the only one I find effective.

Theres a lot of factors going into this and I was well aware of the dependency aspect when I started my pain relief journey. Trying to figure out if I regret it at this point.

7770,Feasibility or switching to Methadone for a very short period of time to induct suboxone?,"Dude methadone is the worst opiate to switch onto subs from. You need like 5-10 days off methadone to take subs and even then most people have horror stories.

I have also been getting pwds up to 80 hours clean the past 4-5 years. I gave up trying subs after like 20 times getting pwds 

You want to get a short acting opiate like oxy then take it a week then take subs."

7774,because the vast majority of them outside of people who post on reddit are giant pieces of shit and make up a huge percentage of property crime.,Probably. Lot of bad stigma out there
7775,Why do people hate addicts or heroin users?,"Because of years of prohibition mentality and idiots who put ""shoot your local heroin dealer"" stickers in their car"
7776,Why do people hate addicts or heroin users?,"People don't want to take the time to get to really know someone or understand why they've made the choices they've made. It's easier to put users all under a blanket and call them stupid and/or worthless because it's easier than trying to understand, or makes them feel better about themselves, or both. 

For example, I was having a conversation with this girl and she was going on about how ""I don't know how people get addicted to pills, I was prescribed percs after my wisdom teeth removal and I didn't get addicted!"" ""addiction's not a disease, cancer is a disease!"" pretty much had no clue what she was talking about, and I asked her if she ever tried heroin and just ""No, I'm not stupid!"" in a way that gave off the overwhelming vibe that she was calling ME stupid without actually saying it. She knew nothing about me. So I think a lot of it is just ignorance and an unwillingness to learn anything new or hear people's experiences."

7781,Why do people hate addicts or heroin users?,"The large amount of negative stigma attached to it, same with Methamphetamine and crack cocaine, PCP, synthetic cannabinoids or just really any drug with a ton of negative media attention.

Then you, dear sir or miss, need to take it with a wee bit of ethanol. Seriously. A little ethanol, of your choice, improved rate and effeciency of of bupe absorbtion. 

Use your ethanol of preference, stronger is good, but too strong or too much will cause chemical Burns and be counterproductive because of increased saliva production response resulting in dilution.

Me? I find 55% ABV gin diluted to about half that with water works well, but it's individual.

It makes a significant difference. Not talking placebo either. There is literature easily dug up.

Generally meetings are 1 hour or 1 hour 15 mins and usually the first 15 mins are doing the readings and handing out coins for clean time anniversaries, etc and the rest of the time is going around the room with each person sharing anywhere from 1 min to 5 mins. It goes by pretty fast for the most part

You are not required to share, ever and you aren't expected to, especially if you are new. If they call on you or ask if you want to share, it's perfectly acceptable to just say ""I'm new here and would just like to listen tonight, thanks"". I'm introverted and hate speaking and I'd pass all the time, it's no big deal.

One last thing, both AA/NA are great, and if you don't care for your first meeting, don't judge it based off that one meeting. Every single meeting is different and I've been to hundreds of different types of meetings with some very different than the others. A lot of factors go into making a meeting what it is, so ""shop around"" and try a bunch of different meetings until you find one that you really vibe with. 

I'd recommend trying some AA meetings as well, even if you are mainly a drug addict and didn't drink. I personally went to AA mainly even though I literally never drank and was a hardcore IV heroin addict for many years. I personally find that AA meetings have more of what I am looking for and NA meetings can sometimes be full of people who just want to talk about who's the biggest baddest junkie. There are great NA meetings out there as well too though.

The meetings at the one I've been looking at are about an hour and a half  according to the website. I just can't imagine what they do for that length of time? Also do you usually have to speak? I'm usually more introverted and would just prefer to listen at least the first couple times.,I wouldn't imagine that you have to speak if you didn't want to everyone is a little timid at first. I used to go to AA classes and I never wanted to talk because I didn't think I had a problem but once I realized I did I've started participating more.
7880,NA expectations?,"NA sucks and is typically full of wiggers (at least around me). I'd recommend AA, a good half of the people in AA in my area are just regular drug users. There's way more sobriety in AA."
7881,State rehab experiences?,It’s just like a psych ward. It’s just a hallway with rooms you can walk up and down. It’s boring as hell.
7882,State rehab experiences?,"A lot of people bitch cuz most are like prison in terms of quality, but I'm grateful af for the state run detox that I went to about 2 years ago. It gave me the opportunity to change and even though I'm not clean right now, it gave me almost a year of sobriety after I got out where I didn't have to suffer.

I personally think that too many people are entitled and just bitches in general about it. As long as it offers a safe environment, a roof over your head, a warm bed, 3 meals and a rapid Suboxone taper, then that's all you need to get clean if you really want it."
7883,State rehab experiences?,Shitty
7884,State rehab experiences?,"Horrible, the bathroom situation was fucked up. They work hard to keep you in there too."
7885,State rehab experiences?,"The one I went to was pretty much just like county jail with a few classes and NA meetings thrown in. Shitty, super boring. Tons of downtime where you just sit around and do nothing; they don’t let you sleep except at night, have you sit around on metal footlockers during all downtime."
7886,Alternate to smoking off foil?,Lightbulb pipe
7887,Lightbulb pipe,"Every time I try to make one of those I break them or they shatter when you apply the slightest heat to them, I swear, it's like they're made of glass,(very thin glass that  cracks so easily)"
7888,"Every time I try to make one of those I break them or they shatter when you apply the slightest heat to them, I swear, it's like they're made of glass,(very thin glass that  cracks so easily)",Do you make a hole to the glass or not
7889,Do you make a hole to the glass or not,"I try to only break the metal thing at the top, but I've made like 5 perfect ones and they all crack within 2 mins"
7890,"I try to only break the metal thing at the top, but I've made like 5 perfect ones and they all crack within 2 mins",They are dry while you heat them right?
7891,They are dry while you heat them right?,Huh?
7892,Alternate to smoking off foil?,"A lot of guys use cannabis dab rigs and that seems to work well for them. The thicker the foil the better as it reduces the potential of burning your dope by keeping a lower heat. If you can get steel foil instead of aluminium that is also better. In the UK you can get foil specifically designed for smoking dope from, those brits think of everything lol"

7894,Oh nice I'm a Brit do you know what it's called or where I can get some?,The foil specifically designed for smoking is given out at some needle exchanges as a method to encourage needle users to switch to smoking. Although I’m sure I’ve seen it sold online but not very commonly; i wouldn’t know where to look for it.
