What is your experience with Phenibut? If you don’t mind another question :)))","Honestly for me Phenibut is pretty mild. I would say I feel stronger effects from a high dose of gabapentin. Maybe it's just because I've never taken a really high dose as everyone warns you not to take more than 2 grams at at time (I've taken 4 grams before and was fine). Phenibut is known for making people very social and I have experienced this myself. When on Phenibut it is easier to connect with people. You feel much less self-conscious and more empathetic, almost like a mild MDMA feeling. I'm sure it helps with withdrawal but it's by no means a cure-all. I would say the best option is to find either subs or kratom, get a few days off the hard stuff then wean yourself off the subs/kratom. Phenibut is much more likely to be effective in subs/kratom withdrawal then heroin or oxy withdrawal (I'm not sure what your DOC is). I think the threat of becoming physically dependent on Phenibut is a bit overblown. I know it's very serious if it does happen, but it's nowhere as easy to get addicted as with opioids IMO. Then again, everyone's different, I'm just basing this off my own experiences."

But a lot of people who use phenibut arent typical drug addicts, they use it like a supplement. For me I need at least 2 grams. But start small, you can always take more.

70,Why do percs seem better than IR Oxy?,"I don't think that it's the acetaminophen potentiating the oxycodone in the Percocets, as another poster has suggested. This would be easy enough for you to test though: take the same dose of Oxy-only IR tablets with an equivalent amount of acetaminophen and see what happens. I suspect it won't change anything as for what you feel. 

Sometimes generic medications are just weaker than they are supposed to be. Generics are supposed contain the same active ingredient plus or minus up to 20%, but from my experience and if you do some research online you will find that generic medicines can in reality vary more than this. 

Another possibility: are these pills coming directly from a pharmacy? If not I suppose it's possible they are fake pressed pills."

Pardue and Apotex have CR Oxy. Pardue can't be crushed though. I don't see these often.

If you're really fucked, make an excuse as to why you can't be there. You may have to get dark, and have some friends be in on it, but you can fake a ""family emergency"" and buy you some time"
95,Suboxone in 30 minutes I got high this morning any tricks to visually take the medication in front of the dock but not have it absorb into my system?,Probably too late. Sometimes at the start of sub treatment they give you a flood dose and tell you to take it buccaly. The bioavailability of buccal nalaxone is half the sublingual absorption.

136,"Took Suboxone, how long will it be until I can hey high on codeine?",Damn dude you fucked around. You probably won’t even get a buzz off syrup at all until like 5/7 days if you have any tolerance at all. Which considering you did that load of sub and aren’t complaining of being sick the syrup might be way to weak.
137,"Took Suboxone, how long will it be until I can hey high on codeine?","If you tolerated that much subs, I doubt the syzzurp will do anything at all.  You'd need over a week clean from all opiates to feel the codeine.  If you have any kind of opiate habit at all codeine will do nothing.

I'd say a month clean. Otherwise you will just feel a nasty promethazine antihistamine garbage feeling.

If those subs were your first time doing opiates, maybe 5 days.  For me codeine is so weak any amount of residual subs will block it.

Check out the drug half life calculator. After 120 hours you will still have 0.5mg in your system down from 30mg. That amount will block codeine IMO."
138,Am I the only one that thinks Fent has longer legs than H?,Must be a fentalog some have long half lives.
139,Am I the only one that thinks Fent has longer legs than H?,"Could be an analogue of fentanyl/etonitazine/even morphine, with a long half life.  Even if you’ve test-stripped it & determined your product contains fent, it’s unlikely that there aren’t other active constituents nowadays, honestly.  

Tar/gun, acetate, or powder?  Does it keep you well longer?  Or just increased duration of noticeable effects?"

141,"Certian analouges are INSANE , i had one hold me for 30 hours",Me too
142,"Certian analouges are INSANE , i had one hold me for 30 hours","Me too, but other people that use the exact same product I use claim that the legs are short. However, IMO this is purely mental, and they get themselves worked up. I think that over 50% of withdrawals are mental. For example, detoxing is jail is much easier for people than detoxing at home because you KNOW you can’t get anything. I’m not claiming that the physical symptoms of WD are not bad/tolerable by any stretch of the imagination, but the mind is a very powerful thing."

147,Straight fent or analogue? Also what kind of h are you comparing to? These things will be needed for accurate answers(somewhat) because of course I'm sure your not testing it all,"It’s an analogue as far as my understanding of the chemical structure goes. These are things that the junkie population I unwilling interact with are not versed in. TBH, Carfent is the only analogue that I have even heard someone say out loud other than norfent being mentioned in jurassic world when they discussed using it as a method to  take down the badass genetically engineered dinosaur. I’m going to do some research before I start spewing bullshit claims. I’m in an outpatient treatment program that drug tests me 1-2 times a week, and they only test for Fent a small percentage of the time due to funding. They have a separate little stick test they have to use to test for F. The main test is very extensive though; it tests for morph, oxy&hydromor&cod, beup, and a few others that I’m not going to claim to know for sure. I ordered tests of my own in bulk so that I can make sure I pass, as I am still actively using. I always have fake urine that I added beup to Incase they are going to test for F, but I always pee in the cup if I can to avoid trouble. I have a good 5 min warning if they’re going to test for F because the tech orders the test over the phone in front of me, but the fake is always ready to go. I occasionally pop positive for other opioids when I test myself, but it’s become a pretty rare occurrence. The H in my area is predominately brown H from south/Central America, with the ocassional appearance of Asian; tar is a unicorn. The cut of choice in my area is mannitol for F and H, but i am unaware of the other potential filler material."
148,Am I the only one that thinks Fent has longer legs than H?,"Fent def doesn't have longer legs, but some analogues do have some pretty crazy half-lives."
149,Am I the only one that thinks Fent has longer legs than H?,"Honestly, If I dose high enough with fent itll make the balf life longer. It's not necessarily that it has a longer half life, as they can be about the same, it's likely the dose for your tolerance set you off enough to over compensate 

Cause I notice the same thing as well. Hydromorphone doesn't last as long til I'm sick as fentanyl in my experience and it is fentanyl tested with gcms no other fentalogue"

178,Will Kratom hold former heroin addicts?,"I bought a kilo of kratom just to test-drive opiates basically, and especially in combination with weed I found it got me high as fuck, but I don't think it needs any more restriction than say alcohol, which is pretty much worse for you in every conceivable way, and costs more money. I honestly don't even think it matters if someone is kratom dependent since everyone's dependent on something and kratom is like $150/kilo which is fucking nothing.

I didn't buy another bag after the kilo though and neither did anyone I tried it with just because taking the raw powder is disgusting. Putting it in a capsule makes it a lot better, but even still it's a huge hassle. I personally see it as completely harmless since the method of ingestion is so shitty and the price is so low, and it is used to treat wd's from heroin, and in comparison to alcohol again, you basically get no buzz from kratom compared to how insanely drunk you can get, so it's not like it's a hazard in that way either, at least any more than alcohol. IMO if you can get addicted to kratom you can get addicted to any substance that provides any anxiety relief."

183,"Hello all, allergies?","The one detox center i was at, there was an older ~60yr guy that was allergic to morphine.

186,"See I would think that, but they are so intense, no matter how small of a dose and I’ve taken them consecutively for weeks without any let up in symptoms. I have a pretty high pain threshold. Everyone I’m with does not have close to the affects that they have on me, but I do have severe vitamin deficiency’s so my health is not perfect so maybe they affect me more intensely?","I commented below but just want to clarify what I said.   

True drug allergies are quite uncommon and most people who claim a drug allergy actually only had an adverse reaction to the medication. These are two very different phenomena. 

The reason I said it is likely not an allergic reaction is because allergic reactions have a very specific set of symptoms depending on the substance causing the allergy. Regarding drug allergies, our bodies have an exaggerated immune response to a certain chemical in the medication.  So at some point, our bodies saw it (the drug/chemical within the drug) as a threatening invader. It then produced antibodies against that chemical. These antibodies are the protectors of our life. They are like soldiers fighting off attempted invasion by enemy forces.  Once a soldier has visualized his target once (color of uniform, movement characteristics color of skin or sounds of the language spoken) the recognition is much quicker the next time he sees one. 

When the immune response is against something that is actually a threat..,it can save our lives. Immunity against certain viral infections is a good example of an appropriate response.When exposed for a second time the body already knows what the threat is and has Ab already formed whose sole purpose is removing the threat from the body.   The same holds true for vaccines. 

When our bodies launches an immune response to something that isn’t a threat is when it can become problematic. Pollen is not a threat to our lives. However if our bodies were tricked Into believing it was a threat, we formed Ab to pollen so that next time it shows up we have a very quick exaggerated response. Symptoms of pollen allergy include sneezing, runny nose, watery itchy eyes, etc. All of these actions encourage flushing of pollen out of the body. 

Common reactions to drug allergies are similar. Symptoms include rash/urticaria, swelling, wheezing or coughing, feeling dizzy and can include vomiting but it is almost always accompanied by other symptoms if it is an allergy. 

I hope you feel better and find what works for you!"

188,"And it’s only with prescriptions of oxys, percs and morphine","It is an unfortunate risk inherent to the nature of medicine. It is common across many classes of medications for an individual to respond differently to certain medications within that class.

219,How long after cocaine can I safely use opiates?,"Sooo I dont know what is considered safely here.

I recently went on a coke binge for much longer than I should have and there were several times I would finish my last line of coke and 20 mins later crush up an 8mg dilaudid and about 45 mins after my last line of coke I'd have snorted 8mg of dilaudid.

The feeling was nice and honestly was the only way I could fall asleep at a decent time. About 2 hours after finishing coke I'd take 3 benadryl am(which also helped extend the dilaudid a bit)

People do speedballs often which is coke mixed with heroin sooo I dont think they interact crazily but I could be wrong.

On a side note as I have now destroyed my septum and have a 2mm hole (basically a non existent septum) I seriously recommend using saline rinses after a night of snorting anything especially coke.

224,How long after cocaine can I safely use opiates?,You should be fine. Your body metabolizes 14 gs of alcohol per hour. Theres 14gs of alcohol in a beer. Your body destroys half the cocaine you consumed every hour after 5 hours the cocaine left is neglible(6-3%). Cocaethylene has a slightly longer half life but not by much.

227,How long after cocaine can I safely use opiates?,"Dude I honestly think that you're good. Im not a big coke guy, but if someone has it I'm down. So after a night of maybe a gram or two of blow and some liquor, there's nothing better than opiates. I usually give it like an hour, smoke a joint, take a shower, maybe do some chores to make the time go by faster, then I take my opiates. Unless you're still completely blasted from blow or dehydrated from the alcohol, you should be fine. Give it enough time for your body to ""reset"" and then go for it. I've combined opiates and coke, so I figure they're fine one after the other. Not ""safe"" because nothing is ever safe when mixing drugs, but I wouldn't expect anything bad to happen to you if you use opiates 1 hour or so after blow"

First of all, you can have seizures from benzo withdrawal, so if you have taken Klonopin steadily for any length of time, you can't just not take it.  

Effexor isn't deadly if you stop it abruptly, but you sure might wish you would.  It's an SNRI, and side effects of stopping include confusion, headaches, sleep changes my all-time favorite, brain zaps.  Even when people are weaned down slowly, they usually get these brain zaps and they're miserable.  I personally get them when I miss one dose of Effexor."

She is not in your body and should have no say in what you take. These are obviously prescription,  so you and your doctor have already come to the conclusion that you need them. Her opinion is irrelevant. I was in control of some of my boyfriend's medications when he got back from rehab, but those were only the controlled ones and only because he asked me to. Your effexor? I cannot think of one reason for her to hold an anti-depressant (again...she needs to be in control. This is NOT NORMAL behavior). If you were an ex benzo addict and she was doling out your klonopin, I can kind of understand that. The rest of this is unacceptable. Those are your prescriptions, you have control over when you take them. What she's doing is illegal actually if you didn't give her permission. Tell her to give you your meds back"

This girl is my fiancée, I’m not going to dump her. 

I have a benzo addiction, opiate Addiction, and basically a pill addiction for three years. It really fucked up my mental health. I went to a doctor and these meds are what he decided to prescribe me. I take my medicine responsibly but she thinks I’m going to go back to my old ways so she took control of my medication schedule. I get anxiety attacks even asking for my meds. I love this girl to death así again I’m not dumping her. She has a good reason to hide my meds but at the same time I’m not the person I used to be and I don’t think it’s healthy the way she dictates when I should take them when she has no idea what the medication is for. I’ve asked her many times to research them so she understands but she shuts the conversation down every time. She hates pills in general because as a kid she was put on meds (Zoloft, lexapro etc). So I’m stuck in a rock and a hard place. I’m an anxious mess.

Walmart sells this little pouch with a combination lock that I like to use as a deterrent to people stealing my meds, but obviously someone could just take the entire pouch. Definitely don't give her your medication to hold onto again. Put your foot down. She is causing you severe distress by depriving you of medication that helps you. If your girlfriend pushes back, I would suggest either breaking up with her, or if you don't want to do that, bring her to your next doctor appointment and explain to your doctor what's been happening, so that he can explain to her how important it is for your to take your medication on a regular basis.

I didn’t want to go out anymore if I’d smoked.  I’d be getting ready for a night out, smoke just a few hits, and decide I didn’t wanna go anywhere, face anyone, or even talk to anyone and end up staying home.  Eventually I had to quit.  I still keep a stash at all times.  Just because if I want to smoke... I’ll have it.  But I regret it every single time I fire it up. 

It’s hard to say if age was my main factor or my opiate addiction because my addiction began around the age of 30.

A few of them are wishy-washy and say bullshit like ""decriminalization"" instead of legalization. But on a national scale, with how much $$$ the illegal drug market is worth, no one is going to want decriminalization when we could have another $100 billion in the US economy. Not to mention all the legal and taxable jobs it would bring.

Honestly ending Drug Prohibition would have so many benefits it's ridiculous. Literally the only downside is a slight initial increase of drug users that will almost definitely level out in less than a decade. That's the only downside. Drug Prohibition is way worse for society than anything drugs could ever do."

Just a couple weeks ago I was in a horrendous flare, and methadone and oxy weren't even touching the pain.  Every 1.5-2 hours I got up to have a gravity (gravity bong hit, it's all I smoke out of) of some nice top shelf indica and wax, and it actually mellowed the insane storm of pain that was raging in my joints.

The 20 to 25 % thc weed thats around now just fucks me up.. I can't speak I get paranoid! It's like taking acid some times.

435,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"No if you keep your smokes spaced out its amazing top 5 drugs out there. 24/7 use feels like absolute shit. you dont feel euphoria on it but you feel bored as shit without it.
The real question should be who tf said benzos are recreational. Like theres absolutely no euphoria unless you need it for anxiety. Why do benzos when you can buy any other drug even dxm is better."
436,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,Anything with a psycadelic aspect will make you realize things you've been repressing. If you took a break from weed while you liked it and when you came back it was shitty you have a negative point of view towards yourself or your surroundings.

I do enjoy it when I don't get paranoid though, but I'm afraid to try it because I get paranoid 90% of the time. If I take 1 small puff I might be ok. Maybe try different strains like Indica or what not? It sucks because I love getting buzzed and weed is so readily available, I feel like I'm missing out."
438,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"i find weed combos well with anything except stimulants, /w em it makes me paranoid and sometimes psychotic. good for comedowns though"
439,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"You’re definitely describing a sativa-dominant strain. You need an indica to eat half your fridge door and sink into your couch like pocket change. 

High THC concentration often results in deep introspection that too easily devolves into straight up paranoia. Confusion, anxiety, etc. Most people don’t know how to channel these effects productively (because they can in fact be ideal for music making & consumption, or TV/Movies, for instance), especially if they’ve had a lot. I revert to how much I love my family and how much I’ve pained them.. so I’m fighting back tears while I’m getting my ass handed to me in FIFA. Def not for everyone, but I still love it, for some strange reason 

The stonier strains that can put you in bed or enhance a nod (indicas, great for WD!!) have high CBD content that also has the effect of counteracting all that THC Jedi Mind Trick shit sativas play on your head meat. A nice rip of this can put junkie ass to bed mid-kick (for a couple hours, at least.) Most junkies would really stand to benefit from strains high in CBD during kicks. (Sobriety & indica may whet the appetite for something a little more.. noddy... so don’t let the guard down, too!)"
440,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Weed is such a boring drug. I mean I guess nothing compares to opiates, but man, all the different times I’ve smoked weed have been let downs. Definitely not my cup of tea."
441,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Weed used to be the shit for me. I got a medical card for it to help with my stomach and intestinal issues (pain, nausea, acid reflux, gas, etc. every day, still have these issues) and it worked pretty well for me for a while. I didn’t really get much anxiety, and it didn’t make a drastic difference with my stomach issues, but it did help. I was definitely smoking excessively, though. My tolerance was so fucked that not even a gravity bong would get me stoned for more than a few minutes. 

For months I kept on smoking, and despite my crazy tolerance it was going alright for me. That is until one day I was smoking out of a bong, and I took a couple hits and then my stomach issues just starting acting up like crazy. I had serious stomach pain and unrelenting nausea, and of course my gut problems make me anxious so I started to panic a bit on top of that. I tried it a couple times after that, and each time the stomach problems just got worse, even with a single tiny hit. 

I took a long break from weed, but one day I decided I wanted to try it again, to see if anything had changed. I took literally the smallest hit off of a bong, to the point where I could barely see the smoke when I blew it out. Same shit happened, and it lasted for over 2 hours. That was a long time ago, and it definitely cemented it for me that I’ll never be able to smoke weed again. Same thing with alcohol. I tolerated it just fine until one day I just didn’t, and my body basically rejected it. I can no longer drink without getting sick, and I have a phobia of getting sick so I pretty much can never drink or smoke weed for the rest of my life. :/"
442,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"On weed I feel weird af. If I smoke enough the world starts looking not real. Like a video game almost, and my motor skills are gone. When sun hits my face I feel like I'm on fire. Also I have this weird buzzing feeling in my head

I prefer some speeeeeed and molly"
443,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I mean, I loved smoking. Then I would get real introspective and fully realize I was sticking needles into myself/totally reliant on heroin. So maybe that has to do with why"
444,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Yeah I used to think this way until I stopped trying to get as high as possible when I smoked. Next time, just try a little bowl pack and see if you like it."
445,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,You probably do way too much
446,You probably do way too much,Nah
447,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"i think its 100% to do with tolerance. When I use to smoke a lot I liked it, never got anxious. Now that I hardly ever smoke its way too strong. I kinda stopped when I started having chronic pain because i found it made the pain worse."
448,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Same. But I find indica strains, low dose, works good.  Less head, more body.  High in CBD too takes away the anxiety.  Edibles and tinctures are the way to go"
449,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,Weed tolerance:  use it or lose it.
450,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I kinda feel like once you take something that fries up your dopamine receptors a little, that smoking weed then doesnt become very pleasurable as you get all the 'psychedelic' effects , paranoia and anxiety but no pleasant rush or feeling for the fact the dope receptors have already took a good kicking. Used to be a 100% pothead from 13 onwards, then around 16 I began to abuse mephedrone and amphet for close on to 2 years, now unless I take benzos getting high for the first time in a day is guaranteed panic and highly exacerbated by opiates too/vice versa the weed exacerbates the background panic brought on by the morphine/oxy (prescribed, following a broken neck and upper spine) and hydromorphone gave me the mother of all panic attacks to the point i went back down to morphine after 3 days. Wouldn't have really gone into all this but seems there are an awful lot of is in the same boat out there ? :/"
451,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Get a strand high in CBD. CBD has antipsychotic properties, which can offset the psychotic properties of THC."
452,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I personally love weed but I know a lot of people who also get very anxious after smoking, sometimes it happens to me as well when a lot of shit is going on in my life. As others have suggested maybe try taking some benzos before you smoke."
453,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"Yeah well its 50/50 for me. I mostly feel stupid,slow and not focused when i smoke it. 
I still smoke it almost everyday tho when im out of opiates. 😂😂"
454,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,I used to be stoned pretty much all the time. Then I started getting weird feelings and paranoia. Now I can only enjoy it when I'm drunk. I kinda hate weed it makes people so boring. And they advocate it like some miracle drug with no drawbacks.
455,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,it's weird it feels like it's lost it's magic I'll have a few cones throughout the day while working and that and it doesn't seem to really effect me that much even when I'm just kicking back and smoking it's lost it's touch and it's not tolerance either I had a 6 month break the second half of last year and when I went back to it it still didn't feel right
456,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I didn't like weed much when I was on opiates and benzos and medication, I felt so uncomfortable and anxious when smoking, but I found it really helped when I wanted to quit everything, and now I only smoke and it keeps me sane and happy and away from opiates. If I mix with pills/chemicals I still tend to be a little anxious. 
I liked the mirror-metaphor someone in the comments wrote. Weed makes you see yourself without the fog of chemicals and it can be brutal."
457,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I think it’s a combination of tolerances, more potent weed than regularly seen before, at least for most. Also higher ratios of thc to cbd, making for a less calm and relaxing high, hell I’d seen indicas tested that have less than a tenth of a percent of any cbd. 

I’d been smoking for years and while it’s changed, it’s not a total change. I still find and come across strains that don’t give me any anxiety or paranoia what so ever, they’re just way fewer and far between than they were previously. And when it’s not, it’s generally the first smoke of the day, for a good twenty or thirty minutes my mind will race and I feel my heart thumping, just adding to it. It’s not terrible though, I still love bud.

 I mean what can you expect really when an entire industry has pretty much turned to focusing on one specific cannabinoid in the highest concentrations possible. 

Either just roll with punches and try to learn your body and more of what it wants or it’s probably not good to at all if you don’t enjoy it or can’t get over whatever problem your having with it. I use to smoke crack for months straight, so a few minutes of questioning myself if I’m okay and having a noticeable heart beat aren’t really shit to me as I KNOW everything’s good, as well as when the later smoke sessions don’t come with that. 

Maybe try treating it like you would if you were drinking when you don’t like drinking. I hate the taste. If I got from nothing to smashing shots, I’m probably puking on the second or third. That alcohol taste just doesn’t agree on a sober mind tongue. But ease into the intoxicated state, and I can keep up. Still may make me sick, but my mind and body handle it far better."
458,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I’ve met quite a few people who liked it until they got into opioids. Then it started causing them problems. 

I had to quit smoking for a few years because weed would exacerbate withdrawal symptoms for me. 

I have read that CBD is an allosteric modulator of the opioid receptors. Maybe the two drug types interfere with one another in some way. 

Now that I’m presently clean from opioids, weed feels enjoyable again."
459,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I'm in the same boat. Honestly happy to see I'm not the only one. As a Florida resident of 50 years I obtained my Med Marijuana License but I'm having a difficult time with consumption. Yes, I need pain relief but I dont want paranoia in order to receive it. Lmao!"
460,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"smoking weed used to make me feel anxiety free and at peace but now when i smoke i can’t help but get paranoid and start getting too deep into my head, i think i might take a break from it for awhile."
461,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"yeah I feel like it’s kinda boring/a bit of a let down, it tends to make me feel a bit weird/dissociated tbh"
462,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,"I agree that not all the effects of weed makes me feel great, but I find the nausea from other things like shrooms/lsd, opes, and alcohol all make me feel way worse than weed ever could. I also find cigarettes make me feel way more like I'm dying when I smoke them, like they are actively destroying my lungs, whereas weed just feels like it burns/stings but not like my lungs are actually covered in shit. I've had mild panic attacks but I can always handle them since I know they come and go, and I had a mind shattering one on LSD that makes weed anxiety feel like nothing, and even for that one I cooled down to just being high as fuck pretty quick.

At this point though I smoke weed because everything else seems objectively worse for you, or is way more addictive, or doesn't let you be nearly as functional, or is way more expensive, or is just really shitty to ingest."
463,Does anyone else think weed is shit?,I wonder how many people end up getting turned off weed because they have a couple hits of a pure sativa and that negative experience is enough to turn them off ALL weed? Though there a a few exceptions to the sativa rule for me. Give me a nice 70/30 indica any day

500,"How many hydros (or mg) could I take before I potentially OD? I’m 5 foot 8 and 110 pounds, male.",You a toothpick my man?!
501,You a toothpick my man?!,Stick bug actually
502,"How many hydros (or mg) could I take before I potentially OD? I’m 5 foot 8 and 110 pounds, male.","hydrocodone is almost always paired with tylenol (acetaminophen/paracetamol/APAP) and you'd overdose and die from the APAP before the opioid portion killed you. hydrocodone has a very high LD50 in rats (~375mg/kg), so assuming a perfect carryover to humans would mean 18,750mg hydrocodone, or 1,875 norcos, would be needed for an opioid overdose - however, that'd also be 609,375 mg APAP which is enough to destroy over 40 people's livers and kill them.

you shouldn't take more than 2,000 mg APAP at once or 4,000 mg APAP per day. safe dose is up to 6 x 5,7.5,10 mg hydrocodone/325 APAP pills and absolutely no alcohol. that's 30-60mg of hydrocodone depending on your pill strength ... realistically you can go over a little bit if it's once in a while, but definitely keep is under ~5-6g APAP and minimize alcohol. APAP overdoses are no fun, they're extremely painful and can result in death, so be careful. if you think you're even close to overdosing, drink a scoop of whey protein to help boost your glutathione metabolic pathway and reduce APAP overdose severity."
503,"How many hydros (or mg) could I take before I potentially OD? I’m 5 foot 8 and 110 pounds, male.",How many do you have?
504,How many do you have?,About 2 bottles with 30 hydros in both
505,About 2 bottles with 30 hydros in both,You better be using CWE method
506,"How many hydros (or mg) could I take before I potentially OD? I’m 5 foot 8 and 110 pounds, male.",No more than 40mg to start if you have no tolerance.
507,"How many hydros (or mg) could I take before I potentially OD? I’m 5 foot 8 and 110 pounds, male.",If no tolerance you should start with 10-20mg. 30-40 probably would give uncomfortable side effects. More than 50mg+ would start to be dangerous
508,"How many hydros (or mg) could I take before I potentially OD? I’m 5 foot 8 and 110 pounds, male.",Honestly you should only need to worry about overdosing on the acetaminophen which is 6000mg for a average sized male (6ft 180lb) youd most likely overdose on that before you actually overdosed on the hydros

510,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,a lot of drugs do this. I can’t exactly pinpoint why but i’ve been through this as well.
511,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,"They do the same to me. I think it's for a few different reasons.

1. I don't really like people all that much, but if I am not using and home alone I get really antsy and anxious easily. Human contact helps take my mind off that. If I am using then I am perfectly content at home with myself and prefer it that way.
2. I think the stigma of being an opiate addict gets to me. I'm a reasonably attractive woman and you probably would never guess I was an addict unless you saw my eyes. However when I am using and out in public I feel a huge sense of shame. Like every single person knows I am using and as such I feel less than. Like I don't deserve to be out in the sunshine with other people. Even though I contribute positively to society, I hold a full-time job, I am a good friend and family member, I volunteer, I keep myself very well-groomed, etc. So I stay home.
3. I haven't found that I've lost interest in my passions. However I have lost interest in other activities that I did just to fill up time."
512,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,"I believe it has to do with a lifestyle change. Instead of doing different things, you get stuck in the motions of  copping, using, and worrying about scoring all over again. I’ve experienced this as I’ve noticed when I’m using I might try and make plans but they often fall through because of other things involved with using taking longer than expecting. Then while using you are less likely to do something without being high. Also tend to go around my family less and less."
513,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,"Yea man same thing happened to me. The year before I relapsed I went and fished the river 90 days in a row, every day the river was open, last year, once.

527,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,"I think it has to do with totally re-wiring our brains, mainly the reward system that is usually run on auto pilot.  
     We crave good food bc our brains know we need nutrients and when we eat, various neurotransmitters are released that make us feel good, and program us to repeat whatever triggered it.   Whether sex, food , exercise, learning something and applying it to life, such as completing a big job at work and getting a raise... the list goes on.   I’m not sure but I believe endorphins are what fits into the opiate receptors, or pleasure receptors.    Sex is the strongest example, IME, ( I used to revolve my life around girls and getting laid ) but after a while, a big shot of dope is way more appealing than a role in the sheets.    The amount of pleasure felt from external chemicals is many many times higher than can be produced  any internal , natural, organic activity we could imagine.  Including sex, food, etc.

And we continue to “ learn these behaviors “ - it might be noticeable.

      Next time, I didn’t even think about making plans.  ( except the planning of scoring some opiates, procuring syringes, and a place where I’d have privacy and maybe a tv-  and not long after that; even the TV wasn’t important.  ) 
          So that’s how I became a total recluse.     I also wasn’t a big people person to begin with.  If I didn’t have severe social anxiety, I doubt I’d ever got so into opiates to begin with.

  I'm a firm believer in if you do these hard drugs long enough that it can suppress your natural pleasure center for life"

I’m content to just take that time to be alone and watch tv, smoke, and keep to myself. Also, by the time I’ve finally been able to get high ive usually spent a ridiculous amount of time dealing with copping my shit so I’m done with people for the day lol."

      They did bring in therapy dogs though.   It was my favorite activity...   I’m sure if I had a pup to curl up with it’d be a comfort when dealing w cravings.   It’d probably be difficult for me to walk him, feed him while in intense WD tho."

543,Opiates make people reclusive...Why?!,"I truly think that it is because we lose contact with our friends that drink after opiates replace alcohol, and our “normal” friends catch wind of our problem; so they’re better than us now.

Other people also wants to share their problems. I take opiates to forget mine, why would I want to hear yours then?

My 2 cents, but I was always a recluse - opiates or not."

Was great when the high started to kick in.

My best ever high was when I first started, got my codeine and tramadol script. Booted up Team Fortress Classic and I was so high I was playing worse rather than better.

Burned out all my receptors now though. :-(   I need at least a week off cold turkey, in order to get 1 or 2 days of a mild buzz then just using to stay well again."
578,Subs to vivitrol?,"Do not take vivitrol. Fuck that shit. Not only will you likely experience some post acute withdrawal, which by the way, if you’ve never experienced, is literally Satan and can’t even compare to a normal withdrawal. 

Obviously if you do it right you can avoid that, but that would entail kicking the subs and taking zero opiates for 7 days prior to getting the shot. Not fun either. 


Otherwise, the shot itself is fucking weird. It’s a gelatinous ball of shit in your ass cheek. It’s sore for a few days, it also completely fucks with your ability to get drunk for some reason. I could drink all night and get a little uncoordinated but no other sensation aside from that, total mental clarity.

I told that to my dr and he said that suicidal thoughts weren’t a side effect, even though i’ve read from multiple sources that they are. It felt like they were really pushing it and ignoring the concerns i had, gave me a bad feeling. I’m probably gonna stick with the subs until i get a bit further in my recovery"
580,Subs to vivitrol?,update ? no one probably cares but i got an appointment for tomorrow with a different sub doc so i will not be in agony for weeks :) i wish i didn’t need the subs but life has been tuff lately. stay safe out there family i love u all
581,Subs to vivitrol?,Vivitrol will keep you from feeling any opiates.. including your own endogenous ones. I wouldn't recommend getting that shot until you've been clear of all suboxone for at least a month..
582,Subs to vivitrol?,Ive been taken the vivitrol shot for ten months nd never had a side affect accept alil soreness..nothin serious at all..i started wit real oc80s nd 10 millie percocets no generics shit haha but did that for few years nd then went to blue guys for like 7-8 years nd eventually bc of money i turned them stamps/ecp...i can finally say im off all that shit for 10 months...i started wit subs but only took them for a month bc eventually ul become dependent on that nd that withdrawl suckss!! but i been blazn everyday for 20 years nd still do plus dabbn nd edibles now..so il never say im clean but im herron nd blue free haaa..plus ucan get gabapentin nd trazadone for help too while ur takn the shot
583,Subs to vivitrol?,"I have nightmares of doing this.  One of my old doctors pitched the idea of switching to the vivitrol shot and I got the cold hot sweats sitting in his office just thinking about it.  Suboxone takes a long time to leave your body if you have been taking it for a decent amount of time.  If you are administered the shot too soon, you are in for one miserable ride."

Which is to say I was blowing my nose a lot and felt really weak and was having cold sweats, but I wouldn't be scared to go through it again. I quit on a weekend so I just chilled out and rode it out.

It really depends on the person but from what I've seen and heard from other people this is the general consensus. 'Brutal' is a bit overkill.

Edit: Dosage is very important too. I think most people that use Kratom are moderate to light users. Everyone I know with the exception of one person all use about 2-4g doses at a time. There's obviously a very big difference between the W/D of someone who uses multiple 8g doses a day and someone who uses it the way me and the aforementioned people do. Just like there's a big difference in withdrawals between someone who's addicted to caffeine who drinks 2-3 cups of coffee everyday and someone who drinks 5 Monsters or Redbull everyday. To go out and say the withdrawals are brutal would be to scare the vast majority of new users into believing their withdrawal symptoms are much worse than they really are, nocebos and placebos are two very real phenomenons."
593,I don't know who to ask... Is kratom addictive to ppl naive to opiates?,"I used kratom daily at really high doses for 3.5 years. The WD's were a shit show. That being said, they are pretty damn mild if you haven't been using it that long. But the problem is kratom does something to serotonin levels as well as opiate like effects so coming off long term use can feel like coming off hydro and an SSRI at the same time. I ended up needing low dose subs to kick kratom."
594,I don't know who to ask... Is kratom addictive to ppl naive to opiates?,"I read that it is and can be. But for me red Bali never did anything? I tried taking 7gs then 8 up to 10 and still had all WD symptoms, so with that being said I think it’s different for everyone?"
595,I don't know who to ask... Is kratom addictive to ppl naive to opiates?,"If they are using it to escape reality and cope with life, it can definitely escalate to something else. If they’re using it for health benefits and responsibly, they’re probably good."
596,I don't know who to ask... Is kratom addictive to ppl naive to opiates?,It can become addictive like anything else. I started taking kratom to substitute my oxy habit. I’m no longer taking oxy but take the kratom twice a day. Does it curb the want for opiates? Sure a little. My situation is I cant get a hold of anything other than kratom so it isn’t really an issue but I would if I could. I can’t speak for taking kratom and never doing opiates but to want something other than kratom is a possibility. Really depends if the person you know has access to other opiates.
597,Best recreational suboxone dose?,"Its not very recreational.  Its a partial agonist. As such, unless you have a codeine tolerance or perhaps even low level hydros to no tolerance at all, bupe will do nothing but make you sick.


You MUST start with microdoses, if you do choose to continue. I am talking like, less than 1mg at a time. You could end up barfing your brains out with a headache so bad that you wish you'd cut your head off, if you do too much."
598,Best recreational suboxone dose?,Recreational use would probably be 1-2mg for someone without a tolerance. The felling effect is for 16-24mg but that should only be used in the first couple days of intense WDs.

When I’m taking subs I don’t generally feel much of a “high” myself but I’ve used other opiates far more than I should. So the effects for myself are probably different from yours. But you could try taking 12mg or 16mg if you are actually experiencing a high from them. The FDA approves up 24mg a day just not all at once. But I have dropped 3 8mg strips at once before because I thought I was going to be arrested, had an accident while license was suspended and quickly took what I had on my person. I definitely noticed a difference that day for sure too so I know the higher doses do make a difference."

I do like them, I just never had much access until recently, but I actually started on subs, except the occasional oxy here and there, rarely. So when I started them, It definitely got me high. By high, I mean altered feeling, physically and mentally. So pretty much it makes me just feel happier, have a better outlook on pretty much everything, and almost gives me a stimulant type feeling? Lots of energy, and waves of euphoria here and there. By the end of the day, depending on how much I did, Ill have a nod and it's easy to sleep.

Actually, in the past month, I decided to give heroin a try as well, so I stopped the subs for a day then railed and smoked some. It was fucking intense, the nod was verryyy intense and so was the euphoria. I felt very content with either being awake, or asleep, maybe you know the feeling. It was like sub x10, except without the stimulant feeling. I decided H is too dangerous/expensive/illegal to create a habit, so I stopped for a bit and switched back to subs. They're super cheap, make me feel so good (don't get nausea either), and I can function 100%. Definitely my DOC"

After you describing how things feel I share the same thoughts with you. The subs make me feel as normal as could be and definitely a little more up beat that if I was completely sober. The only difference is when experiencing WDs from something else the subs don’t have as much of an uplifting effect as it’s more of a sobering feeling put a relief from the other symptoms I have going on. Just be careful because you are gonna need to taper down to hop off of the subs whenever you decide you’re ready to go back sober because you will experience some WDs from them.
603,Best recreational suboxone dose?,"If you have no tolerance then you probably won't want to do more than 1mg. Really .25 or .5mg would be better starting doses, and if it's your first time ever then definitely take .25mg just in case.

Everyone is different, you might be sensitive to it or it might barely effect you. Like the other poster said it's not the most recreational of opiates due to the way it works, but it is a strong opiate in the sense that very little will have a strong effect, comparatively. Also bupe tend to have more nausea than other opiates, which are already notorious for nausea to begin with, so going too high will likely make you feel quite sick which isn't very fun.

You can always take more but you can never take less."

Pretty much washes straight through to your throat.

634,"Can anyone here please explain the difference in high between Oxy, Hydromorphone and Morphine?","Morphine is what I would call a deep high. It has a lot of euphoria, and the rush, but also is less potent than oxy and Hydromorphone. Oxy is less of a deep, heavy high, it's lighter in my opinion, and better overall for pain.

Insurance would only pay for one script (except for occasional “vacation override”) and they used a small private pharmacy. One of them tried to get CVS to fill and they refused and more or less said not to come back. 

But yes he is still alive and never had any signs of OD... if it was too much then he’d throw up and slowly start feeling better... then take another 1 or more. When I first started seeing him he took 5 at one time and I was terrified... called his mom and she was like “nah he’s okay, that’s normal so you better get used to it”. And like I said early on I jumped on the bandwagon because it was very hard to avoid it. On the rare occasion I was home alone all I had to do was check around the base boards, in the air vents or go out to car and look under the seat. When you are handling that many pills a day they are easily dropped and with a whole bottle how important is it to stop and find the dropped one. 

It took him a few months to adjust to such a lower dose ... a lot of chasing pills with liquor. It got really bad but honestly it was way worse before. Over time he adjusted and I started seeing dr/counseling for sub. At first I was bitter because I felt like I was the only one being treated like an addict... but I never NEEDED them whereas he does have real pain. I can rehabilitate and recover with addiction. Him being in pain and with his medical history, I realized they treat him like an addict too. So I’m no longer bitter and grateful that we were able to move on from that type of life."

736,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"Well one, she's not an addict. An addict is someone who takes something everyday (psychological addiction), and with opiates it's not only everyday but they also go in WDs if they don't have it (physiological addiction). She has neither so is not an addict.

This is identical to the difference between an alcoholic vs someone who drinks on the weekends. Or the difference between a pot head vs someone who smokes at parties. Or the difference between a crack head vs someone who does lines every weekend with their friends.

Once a week use of most every comminly used drug is completely compatible with a functional life. She is not addicted. Once a week use has no major impact like daily use does.

The only danger I'd see her in is eventually ramping up to daily use. But if she's sufficiently scared of addiction and has self control then she could probably do this forever with no real consequences."
737,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,I shove about 15mg of oxy in my nose once or twice a month. Having no tolerance and getting the same insane high seems like where it’s at. I’ve got too much other shit I enjoy doing.

743,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"This is a good thread. Because everyone that says they have their addiction under control, is just subsiding from the actual problem. Well not necessarily but in my case anyways. For me I had a weird past when I was young. Starting off smoking oxy80’s when I was 18 10 years ago... you know when you could get 10 for 280-350$?? I was living with a friend and his mom straight up caught me chasing the dragon, didn’t knock on the door for the first time. She basically said you’re don’t or you’re out. I had no where to go at that point and was terrified of being homeless without a job at so young. I only stayed clean for a few months got right back into but was living with my mom at the time. I forgot how she caught me I honestly think my friends mom called me mom and told her? Idk but anyways I already couldn’t go back to my friends and my mom said treatment or the streets. So I said treatment it is. 1 year inpatient at a faith based treatment company. But I didn’t want it and once I got out I relapsed again, next time was drug court. This one actually worked for some reason. Stayed clean for 6.5 years after 1 year of random UA’s and 3 meetings a week. I stopped all meetings afterwards and did well on my own, saved money got married paid $xx,000 for the honey moon out of our own wallets! Then she cheated on me, got divorced and moved in with that same old person I got high with years ago, thinking he was sober too. Boy did that fuck up everything. Straight into the blues k/9s strictly, and when that person left state the only other option which just so happened to be cheaper was H... ok so that’s the backstory. Here’s how I functioned:

I always had my rent paid first no matter what, I could find something to sell or someone to borrow money from. Also me and my buddy had alternating pay checks so he would help me out and I would help him out we constantly had money and got lucky with the pay of our jobs. But don’t get me wrong, within the first year I called out probably 20 times and luckily didn’t get fired, that’s what you do when you’re sick and work a manual labor job... everything’s good always have money always have bills paid, I can do this forever!! Then all of a sudden you realize you’re getting cheap H and want the better stuff! But I only know this one girl... and fuck was she stingy. To the point she would tell all her 10-15 different people to not deal with my buddy and I because we are “shady”... pfft cool thanks lady... so anyways I would pay 10$ And get randomly sometimes good mostly bunk and told her I need the good stuff every time, I knew she always had the good stuff I knew she could so now it’s 20$ a point... but It was constantly fire! But guess what now I don’t have so much money anymore and I can’t go back to bunk.. so now why not get rid of TV we still have internet can do basically everything with it. Boom now we don’t need internet because we can use the free xfinity WiFi !! Woohoo good to go again couple extra hundred bucks a month. But now my tolerance has gone up and I need to spend 50-70$ a day... so now I just start not paying bills until the last minute to have as much extra cash as I can. Hey! I have checks I wonder if I can pay rent woth a check, pull my money out and let it negative my account, it’s like a 35$ loan for 4-5 days he’ll yes!! Back in it... nope 👎🏼. It’s just keeps getting worse and worse until you have no other option but to start selling your shit, stealing from others and finding any means to get that cash so you can function. You can’t lose your job, you’ll lose your roof... and I can’t lose my roof I just can’t.

For me I had a weird past when I was young. Starting off smoking oxy80’s when I was 18 10 years ago... you know when you could get 10 for 280-350$?? I was living with a friend and his mom straight up caught me chasing the dragon, didn’t knock on the door for the first time. She basically said you’re don’t or you’re out. I had no where to go at that point and was terrified of being homeless without a job at so young. I only stayed clean for a few months got right back into but was living with my mom at the time. I forgot how she caught me I honestly think my friends mom called me mom and told her? Idk but anyways I already couldn’t go back to my friends and my mom said treatment or the streets. So I said treatment it is. 1 year inpatient at a faith based treatment company. But I didn’t want it and once I got out I relapsed again, next time was drug court. This one actually worked for some reason. Stayed clean for 6.5 years after 1 year of random UA’s and 3 meetings a week. I stopped all meetings afterwards and did well on my own, saved money got married paid $xx,000 for the honey moon out of our own wallets! Then she cheated on me, got divorced and moved in with that same old person I got high with years ago, thinking he was sober too. Boy did that fuck up everything. Straight into the blues k/9s strictly, and when that person left state the only other option which just so happened to be cheaper was H... ok so that’s the backstory. Here’s how I functioned:

I always had my rent paid first no matter what, I could find something to sell or someone to borrow money from. Also me and my buddy had alternating pay checks so he would help me out and I would help him out we constantly had money and got lucky with the pay of our jobs. But don’t get me wrong, within the first year I called out probably 20 times and luckily didn’t get fired, that’s what you do when you’re sick and work a manual labor job... everything’s good always have money always have bills paid, I can do this forever!! Then all of a sudden you realize you’re getting cheap H and want the better stuff! But I only know this one girl... and fuck was she stingy. To the point she would tell all her 10-15 different people to not deal with my buddy and I because we are “shady”... pfft cool thanks lady... so anyways I would pay 10$ And get randomly sometimes good mostly bunk and told her I need the good stuff every time, I knew she always had the good stuff I knew she could so now it’s 20$ a point... but It was constantly fire! But guess what now I don’t have so much money anymore and I can’t go back to bunk.. so now why not get rid of TV we still have internet can do basically everything with it. Boom now we don’t need internet because we can use the free xfinity WiFi !! Woohoo good to go again couple extra hundred bucks a month. But now my tolerance has gone up and I need to spend 50-70$ a day... so now I just start not paying bills until the last minute to have as much extra cash as I can. Hey! I have checks I wonder if I can pay rent woth a check, pull my money out and let it negative my account, it’s like a 35$ loan for 4-5 days he’ll yes!! Back in it... nope 👎🏼. It’s just keeps getting worse and worse until you have no other option but to start selling your shit, stealing from others and finding any means to get that cash so you can function. You can’t lose your job, you’ll lose your roof... and I can’t lose my roof I just can’t. I just moved an hour away from everything, no transportation, blocked and deleted all numbers that I could see being an issue. I’m on day 6 now. Thanks for reading!",Shit. I’m so sorry. I seriously hope it all turns around for you. I’m sure it will though. You’ve done it before. You got this and are stronger than ever. Thanks for sharing this. I’m going to have my friend read it
745,Shit. I’m so sorry. I seriously hope it all turns around for you. I’m sure it will though. You’ve done it before. You got this and are stronger than ever. Thanks for sharing this. I’m going to have my friend read it,"Right on! I really hope it helps. It’s the reason I post on here. I just started, but ive never done anything like this, before I just got sober and that was it. It obviously didn’t work and have to try something new! This time around I’m gonna share my story and continue to help others. It would be cool to hear what your friend thinks!"
746,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"Being a functioning addict merely means that the *addiction* doesn't interfere too much with a productive life. 

Some people might disagree but IMHO ""having it under control"" in context with opiates is almost always a delusional claim. Give it long enough time and at some point, sometimes after weeks, maybe after years that person will likely lose eventually control. 

There seem to be exceptions to that but those lucky few also have yet to hit the sack without failing."
747,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"Lost £300k business, lost mk3 ford focus RS (new) lost my son, lost my fiancee, lost £92k savings and lost my house.

Now back at home with mum n dad"
748,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,I only use opiates one or two days a month and have for 6years and counting. I have tried most opiates from codeine/lean to oxy/heroin and IVing. Longest period of use is around 4 days once and my preferred ROI is either pill or snort. Some months I just don't use it. I really like the effects of opiates but if I dose too soon again it is no where near the same as the first dose. When I use I usually will take 120mg oxy or buy a quarter G of heroin. I have never been physically dependant.
749,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"There are always going to be people that are ""chipping"". They don't always become full blown addicts. Burroughs talks about this in his novel ""junky"". To some people opiates are just another ""kick"". They don't feel that instant need to feel that way every second of every day. We're not all wired to be fiends."

755,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"I'm the closest thing you'll find to a functioning addict. 

I have a six-figure job at the top of my field. I live in a nice apartment and am relatively in-shape. I've dated some wonderful ladies in the last year. None of them worked out long-term, but for no reasons related to the drugs.

My coworkers know I take a lot of pills, but I'm good-natured at work and my performance is stellar, so they are more likely to joke about it than be legitimately concerned for my health.

I took opiates for the first time 8 years ago as a result of a jaw surgery. I was sucker-punched in an attempted robbery. Since then, I haven't gone more the 3 months clean, and that was only a couple times. I only take prescription pills that I buy on the black market. At this point, I'm very confident in my ability to sniff out fake pills and I never take something if I'm not convinced it's the real thing. I recently saved my current dealer from a bad deal by informing him that the lot of M30s we was going to buy were almost certainly fake (he later found out I was correct).

The most valuable thing I've lost is time. I've spent tens of thousands of dollars on pills and I've wasted literal years of my life in a foggy stupor. I used to be a vibrant wide-eyed, hungry young man with a lust for traveling, reading, competition, meeting people, and experiencing everything the world had to offer. I had opportunities very few people are lucky enough to receive.

Now I'm a perpetually tired and depressed working class man who just can't wait to get home, ice my swollen feet and pop some percs. No matter how sweetly the song-birds twitter or how brightly the sun shines, nothing seems beautiful to me anymore.

That's the best you can hope for if you take opiates every day. For whatever genetic reason, I don't have to genes to predispose me to severe addiction. I'm not sucking dicks under the bridge for my next fix. But I've condemned myself to a slow, withering death instead."

Then it became every saturday and I started to look forward to it.

Then if I had a stressful day at work I'd have some after work.  This quickly became every day  and all of a sudden I wasn't getting high any more merely a mild buzz,  So I switched to a harder opiate and the cycle went on."
759,"Yeah it’s possible, that was me for about 18 months. But all it takes is one crisis to push you into taking it more.

I get up and go to work and come home and help cook and clean and raise the kids and pay the mortgage and vote and clean gutters... and I’m secretly tapering down a years-long Subutex addiction. I snort tiny amounts a few times a day to get a little euphoria and to keep the monkey happily purring. 

I have no illusions that I have it “under control” though. One misstep and It’s the abyss for me. Just a few more weeks of taper... then just maybe..."
761,Is anyone here REALLY a functioning addict & have it under control?,"It is possible. I used this way for years with my own scripts and then after those were out only on weekends or one weekday. 

But then years passed and it went from that to 4 times a week. Then 5. Then any day I had money and if I didn't sometimes I could front. Then it wasn't enough and had to spend damn near $100 per person for me and my husband to feel anything. Then stupidly switched. So while it is possible, it's a very slippery slope. Imo once you go 3 days straight you're fucked. 

If she doesn't think she has a problem though then anything you say will fall on deaf ears. She won't know until it's too late, and won't stop until she's finally done herself. Just try and be there for her when she decides enough is enough."
762,Everyone always references “ba” for oral morphine etc. What does that stand for / mean?,"Bioavailability is the amount of drug that is actually usable to your body.  When you eat morphine, your stomach can absorb way less of the morphine than if you were to inject it.  Therefore you’d get way higher from 15mg injected vs 15mg eaten"

764,Everyone always references “ba” for oral morphine etc. What does that stand for / mean?,Yea oral morphine BA is terrible.  Only thing it’s remotely good for imo is bridging to lower your tolerance from higher strength opis.

Keep at it bro."
787,How fucked am I?,"Depends on a few things. How long ago you first started using, your metabolism, how much you used during your mini bender, how strong was the shit, ect.

Overall, it probably won't be the worst. But try to get some subs, kratom, weed, xanax, clonidine, even lope (worst case scenario) if you have too. Any of those would help a bunch. I know it sucks. But try to tough it out and just know you never have to go through that again, if you don't want too."

789,How fucked am I?,For me if i use for 3 days in a row im back to square 1.  Doesn't matter if im a month or a year clean. 1 day using and i just sleep most of the next day then im fine. 2 days and i get mild wds for a day or two. 3 days and im doin fat shots and wake up dope sick.
790,What's your best or worst story about cold copping?,"My best experience with cold copping was when someone I don't really know told me where a good dope spot is, and I went there, and I just told the corner boys what I needed, and they took my money and gave it to a guy in a house across the street, and then got me a bundle of their shit, and it was absolutely fire, and the bags are nicks but they're fatter than most dime bags from what I hear, and feel like they have minimal to no fent in em. It's a low-key spot so cops don't usually patrol the block a lot like other more popular blocks."
791,What's your best or worst story about cold copping?,"My brother in law once was driving back from picking up. A car pulled up and legit tossed a half a g into his window wrapped in notebook paper with a phone number on it. He called the dude later and the guy was all sketched out as if he didn't randomly throw dope into a stranger's car hours earlier lmao. He mistook my BiL for someone else I guess? 

My husband tried to cold cop 14 months ago, a year ago today he entered rehab. Dude gave him like legit tar. Like from the street lmao. Then called my husband like 3x to see if he wanted coke. Like no wtf? I was super pregnant at the time and pissed off he was using again anyway, let alone the fact he wasted $20 on street dirt. I don't think he ever tried after that since he's super shy."

Just cut a little off and smoke it. And while it was very sedating it last about an hour with very little euphoria.,"I definitely would prefer H but I never would do that much or that often. Got fentanyl/heroin (I think I even paid more for that sample) then smoked the whole bag in 2 nights of heavy smoking when normally the same amount of (I think relatively high purity) heroin had lasted a week or two. Smoking it I got some of my best highs in my life but would throw up and black out like every hour. 

That could just be because there was a little bit of heroin and I was just smoking more than I normally would’ve in addition to fentanyl. Didn’t know it had fentanyl until I had finished it and the friend who bought it told me it tested. And people with the patch have said that it’s just hours of bliss."
825,What would happen if I smoked a fent pressed 30?,If ypur lit off of 30 mg oc you prob shouldnt play with fent if you do i would take one small hit at a timen wait a bit how do u know its pressed
826,If ypur lit off of 30 mg oc you prob shouldnt play with fent if you do i would take one small hit at a timen wait a bit how do u know its pressed,My buddy with a lower tolerance ODd off half last night and is bringing it over to me to test with fent strips.
827,My buddy with a lower tolerance ODd off half last night and is bringing it over to me to test with fent strips.,"OD'd on half a 30? Wonder what the results will be 🤔🤔🤔




Edit: Oh and Id make a volumetric solution with the assumption it's 50% pure fent and work your way up with boofed doses. 



I.e. if the pill piece weighs 100mg, then dissolve it in water with the assumption its 50mg of fentanyl. 


100mL water=.5mg/mL, a starting dose of fent for you would be maybe .1, so boof a fifth of a mililiter and then adjust accordingly. 



Be sure to A- make sure fent is water soluble (90% sure it is, but not actually positive) and B- put the sealed bottle of fent-water in a tub of warm water for a little while and shake it really well before each use



If you really wanna be safe, assume the pill is 100% fent. Or even 100% carfent


Oh and it most likely contains less than a couple miligrams so youll have to end up taking way more than a fifth of a mL. But better safe than sorry."

But I would buy test strips to be safe. Tar is pretty easy to tell if real or not. It should smell like vinegar and taste bitter. (I know its sounds weird but if you lick it you can usually tell because its bitter as fuck.) West coast tar is usually WAY safer than fent 30s. I've been using tar for over a year now and only got fetty in my tar 4 or 5 times.  The problem with fent 30s is you dont know how much is in them. Sometimes they're bunk other times they're way too strong. With your tolerance I would stay far away from fent 30s.

So who knows how many mg might be in whatever or hitting a hot spot plus with fent ur eather passed or getting sick or dead its not worth it"
851,What would happen if I smoked a fent pressed 30?,you really dont need to with your current tolerance. The only time I would ever recommend fent is when tolerance gets so high that you can no longer get a buzz. Even then I would still recommend time off before going to fent because tolerance is a never ending cycle.

But ime, if it's mostly heroin with mb a little bit of fent and you do testers, you'll usually end up being fine. It's def wayyyy safer to get dope than fent 30s, fent doesn't even feel euphoric like oxy and dope, it just makes you nod out."

892,How quickly do Heroin overdoses after using?,"Instantly to a few minutes at tops, in my experience."
893,How quickly do Heroin overdoses after using?,"Depends on just how hard they OD'd and ROA.

Smoking hits you really quick, but is hard to OD on because you have to take it one hit at a time. Snorting starts hitting you in about 5 minutes and is fully kicked in by 30 minutes, so it could be anywhere from 5 to 30 depending on just how much you took, more drug=less time

Shooting, less than 5 minutes regardless of dosage. Instantly if it was way too much.

I hope this helps."
894,How quickly do Heroin overdoses after using?,"I have OD'd right away from IV use and after about 30 minutes with nasal use. It depends on the strength of the dope, the ROA, and if you have anything else in your system. It is different for everyone I'd think."

I am not sure any of these will really help you with the physical symptoms though, more to help the brain heal from it."
903,For months clean? Should I still feel like this?,there is no way you should still be having withdrawal symptoms after that length of time. The fact that gaba helps leads me to believe you may have an underlying condition.

915,"I feel mild withdraw symptoms while on suboxone, is this normal?","It may just take a couple of days for the sub to build up in your system before you feel completely normal. 

When I first got on subs I still felt like I was in minor withdrawal for the entire first day and a good portion of the 2nd if I remember correctly. This was switching over from 1-1.5 g’s of BTH per day. However, the further from my last use I got the better I felt. 

These days I jump back and forth so much that the subs will hardly touch my withdrawals. Last time I tried to switch over I took 24 mg’s throughout the day and was still sick AF. Ended up buying more fucking heroin because I couldn’t ride it out lmao"

935,Why so hard to Stay Off opiates?,I think its all individual. Some people come back 100 percent while some don't. I think our environment and lives have a lot to do with it. For instance if youre homeless or have always been depressed then it may be harder to enjoy sober life with nithing to look forward too. But if youre a successful person with a good job and family.. When you get clean you may truly enjoy it and have motivation because there is morr to enjoy. It's also important to try and progress when you're clean. My problem was id be clean for a couple months but still just sat at home all day doing nothing on my phone ans was depressed. We have to push our comfort zone and get out!

Bulk (a box of 28 or more) it was only £10 per 80, so maybe ask about bulk prices too? But for that price I’d totally pick up one or two just to test out.

I also gave up looking a long time ago, perhaps it's time for me to do more research 

I'm in the same area you are - I know I have it, have probably had it my entire life. I'm intolerant to CBD products.

I take low dose kratom a few times a week, that helps a little. Afraid to go any higher because I don't want any dependance to grow. 

I've supplemented with various supplements that support GABA production to mild changes. I work out a few times a week; that usually helps. I use other supplements (vitamin D, as an example) that help a little. I take supplements / try modalities that ease the CNS and address the adrenal glands. Helps, but in my case my anxiety isn't too severe. 

I've learned how to mitigate the low grade pain I seem to always hover around in with stretching, yoga, hot baths, supplements, PT, etc. 

Part of it is time and age; I've gotten older and more used to navigating the world in my body. I'm grateful for being able to have these things in my life. 

BUT - None of those things come close to opiates. 

The first time I tried opiates I finally felt Normal. Not HIGH (that came later) just NORMAL. 

That's the way I feel on low dose opiates. I feel NORMAL.

The way I want to feel, every day, is just FUCKING NORMAL.

I've supplemented with various supplements that support GABA production to mild changes. I work out a few times a week; that usually helps. I use other supplements (vitamin D, as an example) that help a little. I take supplements / try modalities that ease the CNS and address the adrenal glands. Helps, but in my case my anxiety isn't too severe. 

I've learned how to mitigate the low grade pain I seem to always hover around in with stretching, yoga, hot baths, supplements, PT, etc. 

Part of it is time and age; I've gotten older and more used to navigating the world in my body. I'm grateful for being able to have these things in my life. 

BUT - None of those things come close to opiates. 

The first time I tried opiates I finally felt Normal. Not HIGH (that came later) just NORMAL. 

That's the way I feel on low dose opiates. I feel NORMAL.

The way I want to feel, every day, is just FUCKING NORMAL. 

You kinda reinvigorating me to look at this again and dive into the medical literature and see what's new. If you find anything out there, let me know. 

I'll do the same.","So you are thinking of trying low-dose naltrexone?

Also, ever tried kava? It's pricey but may be helpful for you to use every so often. Supposedly it increases GABA receptor density (GABA helps the nerves to relax) and supposedly isn't physically addictive like benzodiazepines are.

I think I'll get some naltrexone and start with 0.5-1mg. Its use in treatment of opiate addiction and alcoholism is enough for me to try it out.

I'm really worried about getting sucked in to full on alcohol, benzo and opiate addiction because they're really the only things that make me feel content."

SSRIs are garbage drugs that only help a minority of people; and people are constantly forgetting or are simply unaware that there are other antidepressants available out there as well. The fact that you prefer the more stimulating opioids like tramadol, tapentadol and oxycodone with tramadol and tapentadol being very strong noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors could mean that you have a problem with low noradrenaline and dopamine. Just a gut feeling but your uneasiness and preference for the stimulating opioids could be symptoms of having ADHD.

You should look into more stimulating ADs like Wellbutrin, Nortriptyline and MAOIs - and also have a psychiatrist screen you for ADHD which could give you scripts of stimulants to try as well. All these medicines will boost your natural endogenous opioid production as the monoamine system is heavily interlinked with the opioid one. If you still have cravings for opioids you could combine your AD with maybe suboxone or kratom. Oh and by the way, kratom is a great replacement for those dirty acting shit drugs tramadol and tapentadol. Unlike tramadol and tapentadol kratom can also be combined with any antidepressant including MAOIs. Probably want to avoid taking SSRIs/SNRIs/strong SRI drugs for your problems and if you already found no relief from SSRIs.

But yes I do believe that in some people there definitely is an endogenous opioid deficiency - these people probably need to be on opioid replacement therapy (ie sub/methadone) for life. If you suffer from anxiety and depression other antidepressants will be helping you as well in combatting these problems and your possible natural opioid deficient state - but some unfortunate few people may still need an opioid of course.

I would want to say though that depressed people in general probably are in a constant low endogenous opioid/endorphinic state, but for some or a lot of these people other antidepressants will raise endogenous opioids through downstream action enough to restore them to normal levels."

I have often wondered recently if I do in fact have ADHD. I took amphetamine once, and I could definitely focus and do things better and felt more content, but the physical tension/unease issue I have wasn't really helped, if not worsened. I am generally sensitive to stimulants and avoid them. But don't really fully remember the amphetamine experience since it was so long ago. Also don't know exactly the dose I took, so you may have a point there.

I think I'm more likely to be aspergers. It's hard to get an actual real diagnosis where I live. I just know that SOMETHING is off and I've started self-medicating to get relief. I have no reason to be how I am, other than some mental deficiency. I didn't have that bad a childhood, get abused or bullied, or anything like that. Just have anxiety and some related depression. The anxiety is worse and really wears me down to a point of almost constant fatigue and irritability.

Do you think I should ask my doc about tianeptine? That's a tri-cyclic antidepressant and opioid agonist. I actually tried Amitriptyline (a TCA) a few times, but the constipation was horrible, so doubt I would do well on tianeptine unless I did some anti-constipation protocol, too."

Well yes, not everyone with ADHD responds well to amphetamines or other stimulants but usually they can find something that helps. Also if you have no idea what dose you took or even the quality of the shit you were taking then that doesn't really say much either. If it was some powder it could have been anything really, like some dirty rc, and racemic street amphetamines can be quite different from pure dextroamphetamine in terms of potential side-effects.

>I think I'm more likely to be aspergers. It's hard to get an actual real diagnosis where I live. I just know that SOMETHING is off and I've started self-medicating to get relief.

Well you could be all three, or four of those: Asperger with comorbid depression, anxiety and ADHD. The combo of Asperger or autism with ADHD is extremely common. Depression too.

>Do you think I should ask my doc about tianeptine? That's a tri-cyclic antidepressant and opioid agonist. I actually tried Amitriptyline (a TCA) a few times, but the constipation was horrible, so doubt I would do well on tianeptine unless I did some anti-constipation protocol, too.

Maybe, if you won't abuse it. Tianeptine is technically a TCA but their effects are nothing alike!! Tianeptine lacks anticholinergic and adrenergic properties - so it most likely will not cause constipation. As for a comparison, when I tried tianeptine at 50 mg daily, I actually had increased bowel movements!

This may seem a little extreme but you may maybe want to look into MAOIs also. Moclobemide could be a good alternative and you usually don't have to follow any dietary restrictions on it, though probably don't want to eat tyramine rich foods in excess. You can combine Moclobemide or any other MAOI for that matter with both tianeptine and for example bupropion."

He is extremely honest with what he is selling to me (pressed pills). When he gets different batches he always explains everything to me (price difference, if there are deals available, why certain batches cost more than others, etc.).

But I know a lot of people that say some of that stuff helps them get at least a couple hours of sleep, especially benzos."
1039,"It could possibly cause RLS, everybody is different. For me personally when I'm in withdrawal the only thing that puts me to sleep is more opiates sadly.

Most of them actually make my RLS worse even after taking something like requip on top of them to combat it.

High benzo dose also lets me sleep but I’m on a tight leash with that prescription because of past abuse so I can’t really do it eveytime. Everything else (Bendryl, Nyquill, Nytol etc) gives me RLS in high enough doses for me to sleep. Robaxacet with carbomethamol (spelling?) might work but I wish it didn’t come with Ibuprofen/Acetominophen/Aspirin...! Micro-dose of opiates works but I try to avoid it."
1040,Gout and dope?,that sucks.. i've seen people dealing with gout and its not pleasant looking.  dont jump to gout right away though because there are specific criteria for gout that only a doctor could diagnose.. hopefully its just a one-off situation ya know.  and hope that powder didnt kill your kidneys lol

1046,What does the gout in your foot feel like?,"Omg it was horrid. So first my foot felt really stiff like I had a cramp I couldn't shake. Then it turned bright red, got all swollen and hot at the base of the toes! The swelling went down a bit, now it looks like a black and blue mark. Still hurts, too."

1048,"I dont think thats gout... i mean it could be idk what that actually means in all fairness, but I got what yore describing when i was shooting in my feet... do you shoot anywhere under your hips?","Nope, just my arm. It's definitely gout, I've seen it in my patients at work many times. I just never heard of it happening as a result of opiate use."
1049,Opiates and etizolam?,"Yup, I've tried it. I woke up in the middle of a busy street surrounded by paramedics. Definitely not safe especially because Etizolam gives you the delusion of sobriety (you think you're sober even though you're absolutely fucked up)"
1050,Opiates and etizolam?,"Yeah pretty dangerous. I mean benzos are pretty safe on their own, but add them on top of any other CNS/ specifically respiratory system depressant and it can easily turn your lights out for good. That being said I used to be heavy on the opiates and could easily take 2mg of etizolam on top of my dose without any noticeable ill effects. But I wouldn’t recommend it. Opiates were just as fun without etizolam, and all the etizolam did was make me careless enough to do a little too much dope and pass out too early. Just really wouldn’t recommend it man"
1051,Opiates and etizolam?,No fucking way.
1052,Opiates and etizolam?,It can be dangerous when you mix too much.
1053,Opiates and etizolam?,"If you take very small amounts, it's fine. The problem comes with re-dosing and not knowing how prone you are to it. We all lose some self-control when under the influence.

So, not recommended. Just stick to one or the other."
1054,Opiates and etizolam?,NO
1055,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,Shit forever lol how long u been using
1056,Shit forever lol how long u been using,"Fuck man that’s what it seems to be for me. I quit 3 months ago. Tried to get high on prescription roxi for my birthday (not a relapse, just a planned celebratory single dose) and I snorted all 3 of the pills I bought within an hour and still did not feel high. I suppose this is because I used to use fentanyl pressed pills and my tolerance was sky high, coupled with the fact that I’ve been using kratom for maintenance. But still, after 3 months I expected to easily be able to get high with 30-45mg of oxy. But nope, not even 90mg was enough. Crazy how tolerance works. I think it depends a lot of whether you’ve been totally clean or using something for maintenance though."

1059,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,"This is prolly the last thing you wanna hear but I stopped taking oxy for 2 years and tried it again after and needed around 100mg to feel anything which was similar to the dose I was taking before I quit. Idk why but my tolerance I sincerely believe will never return to normal, hope you don’t have the same problem lmfaooo"
1060,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?," Honestly, when I read these tolerance questions regarding opiates, I recommend just getting off and staying off..find another drug class to experiment with as its just not worth the possible trouble..

  Once someone gets addicted or develop tolersnce, it takes several weeks of clean time before opiates regain any sort of magic ..they can still get you high but tolerance will develop at a very fast rate if you start using them with any regularity.."
1061,How long does oxy tolerance last after stopping?,Month
1062,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Depends on tollerenca im sure some would die off of 120 mg
1063,Depends on tollerenca im sure some would die off of 120 mg,I have used alot of tramadol so i think my tollerance would be a bit higher
1064,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,"With no tolerance a 30mg amount will be perfect! Honestly you will get rocked, don’t listen to the people going above this until you gauge for yourself."
1065,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Go slow with it try 40 mg if 25 was weak
1066,Go slow with it try 40 mg if 25 was weak,Never tried oxy so i wondered if 25mg was enough. Also will mixing oxy with other opiates like cosylan and tramadol potentiate it

1068,[deleted],Benadryl is impossible to get here. I have some antihistamines. Is oxy liver toxic? I am on alot of methyl tren now and have to be careful.
1069,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,35 mg of oxy should have u feeling good chew it up and youll be vibing within the hour
1070,35 mg of oxy should have u feeling good chew it up and youll be vibing within the hour,Will i nod out on such a dose?
1071,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,Well do youbtake tramodol everyday n how much of it do ubtake
1072,Well do youbtake tramodol everyday n how much of it do ubtake,Not everyday but i have had binges and i take it whenever it is avaible. I have to take about 500mg staggered to get completly fucked up
1073,Whats the overdose range for oxy?,First off do u know you can have seizures from doses that high of tram.. Second oxy is alot stonger start with no more then 25 mg

I wanted to quit just like you. But would mess up Every time and try and justify it. Eventually we have to be honest with ourselves and admit you aren't totally ready. Just that realization made me want to quit Even more. And when I eventually did quit it was a lil different and i knew i HAD to stop. It doesn't have to happen that way. But it did for me. I always knew I wanted to quit but wouldn't act on it. The letdown you give yourself fucking hurts lol. Telling yourself. You'll quit but never do. Its no way to live life having a chemical control you like a parasite. You got this man. Have a lil faith or confidence. You know you can do this.

I have been given all the advise on how to physically quit, but how can I mentally quit?",Try liquid drops of CBD its concentrated it's not gonna get u high but it works really well on taking away pain and anxiety then ur not relying on any pharmaceutical.  I'm going through the same things myself so I understand I'm just going through withdrawals of over 12+ years opiates  now on suboxone but I'm in terrible pain so I use cbd . If u get quality stuff it runs about 150.0 so that's the only issue it can be expensive also depending where u live if it's legal I'm in California.  U can always order it online. Just a though.

""If you take hydrocodone or oxycodone and either bupropion, dacomitinib, fluoxetine, hydroquinidine, paroxetine, or quinidine together, your pain medicine may not work as well.""

So i would guess no. Ive never heard of using it to potentiate either. Did someone tell you they do?"
1126,Wellbutrin as a potenator?,Wellbutrin has a stimulant like effect so no
1127,Wellbutrin as a potenator?,I used to snort those things when in wd's looking for energy or some buzz.   I honestly cant see how they would potentiate any opiate.
1128,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,"Yea bud. doesnt even really matter your weight. Even with zero tolerance youd just get a pretty solid nod going with that.

Edit:
Your weight definitely matters. i just mean that even at a low weight (120lb) you wouldnt really overdose.
Im no doctor though. I just know from experience.

Stay safe!"
1129,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,"We are not doctors so we cannot tell you what is safe and what is not safe. What I can say, is you can always take more, but you can never take less. So take some and evaluate how you feel in 30 minutes if you're okay, take a bit more, and so forth until you've reached your desired sweet spot. 

Also, just because it seems like you're early on in your addiction, consider quitting now. It's a lot easier to walk away while it's still a choice. That's all I'm gonna say on that because I don't want to patronize you."
1130,10mg of Oxycodone is it safe to take a 10mg morphine pill?,Yes because morphine has a low oral bioavailability but I wouldn't take it if you're on Oxy as that's a waste imo. If you want to add to the Oxycodone you already took take 25 to 50 milligrams of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).
1131,Yes because morphine has a low oral bioavailability but I wouldn't take it if you're on Oxy as that's a waste imo. If you want to add to the Oxycodone you already took take 25 to 50 milligrams of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).,What would be the best way to take the morphine?

1135,"I looked on psychonaut and it didn’t say anything about the two being dangerous I’ve took 500mg of tramadol anyway, feeling nice lol","Everyone’s different.  The danger with tramadol is more related to seizures, whereas codeine would just be respiratory depression really (or allergic reaction in a VERY rare instance).  If I were you, I’d just pick up an antihistamine like Doxylamine and take a dose of that with my codeine.  Definitely helps stop itching."

I'm a 28 year old white dude who weighs 140 lbs. And I was the only white guy in the entire area. Just stay alert and read the situation, it's not that hard here where I live. If you're worried about getting robbed or sold fake stuff maybe just buy a little bit so that you can go to try it and if it's good go buy more"
1140,Is cold copping a horrible idea?,Depends on what city cant say it here but that really Is a factor I'm on east coast mssg me if u r
1141,Is cold copping a horrible idea?,"Your not doing this because you think because u drank that means you're back to day zero, right? 

If so that doesn't mean shit. You're doing great don't stop."
1142,Is cold copping a horrible idea?,Look if you ain't shady looking it don't matter much. They want your business. Honestly IMO I find it easier for a female to do this than a male. Dealers trust females more and don't think they would set them up
1143,Is cold copping a horrible idea?,"Not to be sexist but for a girl I’d recommend against going out alone at night.  It’s the street and people are fucking mentally sick, desperate, and don’t give a fuck about anyone life including their own.  

Can you get a buddy to go with you?  I only say this because every girl that’s ever told me about trying to cold cop in cities said they just got taken advantage of, groped, or worse.  

At least go during the day, and to an area with considerable numbers of people around

If you must go alone at night, AT LEAST bring some form of protection.  Taser, gun if you’re bout that, etc... 

Funny story (and genius idea for peace lovers/tree huggers)... someone I know actually brought a small concealable bullhorn/megaphone with her to cold cop - though I’m sure a dollar store air horn can would work just fine - and when a group of old men ended up approaching and threatening her, she “blooooop’d” it real quick and said “y’all  wouldn’t believe how loud this shit gets”

The pussies scattered faster than light flashed rats lol"

1145,Hypnagogia. Similar to that half awake half asleep feeling you may get as your falling asleep or if you only partly wake up. Google it.,lol such a weird word
1146,What exactly is “nodding out” and why does it feel so good?,"Neat question, but I feel like the answer might be so in-depth that it wouldn't mean that much to a layperson. Hopefully not though and someone answers. Even complicated things can sometimes be simplified to an extent that it can be understood to a lesser degree, but some things just require you to do the time to learn all the knowledge underpinning the understanding.

I know (and I mean know in the loosest possible sense) that benzos work by doing something to a certain chemical ""gate"" that moves things (ions?) from one place to another in the brain, which I think inhibits the effect of something called GABA at certain receptors. I've read that this is why mixing barbiturates and benzos is so lethal, because while one type of medication reduces or increases the number of these chemicals or ions, the other reduces or increases the frequency, meaning 2+2=8. I wonder if opiates work a similar way?

I had a look on wikipedia, on the [endorphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins) page:

>In the [PNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system), endorphins, primarily β-endorphin, are released from the pituitary gland and bind to μ-receptors. The binding of these two components inhibits the pain signal of the periphery nerves by blocking the neurotransmitter [substance P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_P). The mechanism in the CNS is similar but works by blocking a different neurotransmitter. When the endorphin binds to the μ-receptor, it inhibits the release of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which, in turn, increases the production and release of dopamine, the neurotransmitter associated with pleasure.\[15\]\[16\]

So it seems that opiates inhibit the release of GABA, but whether this is true of all opiates or just endorphins I don't know. But as far as I can tell there are a bunch of different opiate receptors with varying effects, and each opiate will have a distinct binding profile.

Whether this is significant or not, it seems that opiate receptors are considered ""G protein-coupled receptor"" ( ...constitute a large [protein family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_family) of [receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor) that detect [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) outside the [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) and activate internal [signal transduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction) pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses.). From wiki page on GABA:

>Two general classes of GABA receptor are known:\[3\]  
>  
>GABAA in which the receptor is part of a ligand-gated ion channel complex  
>  
>GABAB metabotropic receptors, which are **G protein-coupled receptors** that open or close ion channels via intermediaries (G proteins)  
>  
>Neurons that produce GABA as their output are called GABAergic neurons, and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the adult vertebrate.

So as far as I can tell opiates inhibit GABA and in turn causes dopamine to be produced. So they cause drowsiness in a similar way many ""drowsy"" medications do, such as benzos, but how similarly I don't know. I simply don't have the knowledge to know whether most of what I've written is right, because I don't have the more fundamental understanding of how the brain works, so don't take any of this as gospel. A little bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Whether we could understand to any meaningful extent an explanation beyond ""it does things to the chemicals in your brain"", who knows. Hopefully someone with the expertise can reply and try their best to dumb it down for us. May be worth posting this on ELI5 or another ask questions sub if you're really interested.

edit: Also worth keeping in mind that we don't fully understand how many medications work, opiates probably included. From [here](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/opioids-mechanisms-of-action):

>Inhibition of neurotransmitter release is considered to be the major mechanism of action responsible for the clinical effects of opioids. Nevertheless, despite extensive investigation, understanding of the cellular actions of morphine and other opioids is incomplete."

You won't make it home at all if you wreck and die, or even worse, kill someone else (worse bc you already knew the risks you were taking while driving high, those other people didn't sign up for that even if everyone knows that there is technically a chance of dying from getting hit by a driver under the influence every time they get in their car, you still don't expect it and shouldn't have to).

I always leave my rigs at home to make it easier to wait so that I couldn't do my shit even if I wanted to. Plus when you wait until you get home that makes the shot that much better bc you can just sit and enjoy it without having to worry about someone seeing you do it in your car or call the cops bc you're taking too long in the circle k bathroom so they assume you're shooting up, or have to worry about getting pulled over bc you're driving extra shitty since you're high.

1193,Anyone had a piss test sent to the lab while using fake pee (quickfix in my case)? What was your experience?,"You’re fine. Most employers have a contract with a certain lab, so they collect it wherever is convenient for you then ship it to thier lab. 

Just went through this a few weeks ago and i read a few stories online about people getting busted for substituting. The few of these stories that come up are suspicious. They usually are from new account users and don’t have many details. This leads me to believe that the reviews are fake perhaps from a shill for a different synthetic urine company. 

I also think that if you give the person administering the test any reason to suspect you may have just substituted they may have some BS protocol they go through to make you perform an observed test. Things such as taking way too long in the bathroom, or making noise with the bottle, leaving the bottle or cap in the bathroom. 

If its on temp and looks like pee the person administering the test cant really do anything even if they do suspect something.  If you made it past the initial validity testing done there at the collection site and they poured it into tubes and shipped it you are fine."

1218,Really Need Educated/Experienced advice - In current withdrawal - should I dose for dream Job interview in 2 days?,"So you are on day 3 now. Well day 5 you should start feeling better, so a tiny dose might be all you need.

I'd take a dose with me, in my pocket, during the interview. If you feel you need it, do it. I've done it before when I came back to work on day 6 - I had a small dose on me. I got through the shift without it in the end as I felt better at the end of the day.

Deffo do not take benzos.  You don't want to be withdrawing and benzoed out.  Being in withdrawals I think makes you not feel the benzos as much but they are definitely there."

Thank goodness... It's based on education, experience, and skill.  They will check references but not a problem.  I'm actually a model employee as far as work and productions is concerned.  Have been in leadership departments of past employment locations for past 15 years.  Developed this problem really in 2015 but started when I broke my leg in 2002.  Funny...I enjoyed opioids then, and was in surgeries for 3 years straight... prescribed Opioids the ENTIRE 3 years.  Soon as I healed, didn't even ween off... just stopped.  And I know it's crazy, and maybe ignorance is bliss, but I swear I did not experience any withdrawals then.  

I didn't touch a single opiate until maybe 2005-8 at a party or two.... then nothing for 7 years.  A co worker had a steady supply and that's when I really began to enjoy the oxy ride.  It's so strange to me I could do 3 straight years of Oxy and stop without thinking about it before, but now that I know withdrawals are associated with stopping, I swear it makes it 1000 times worse.  Plus, I was in my early 20's back then so maybe my body processed the chemicals easier...kinda like when you're young and never used to get hangovers....now they last 3 days lol."

I know I was over the worst at the end of day 3/early day 4 so was fine until they moved up the interview.

And @\_morpheus\_23 - You're exactly right....I could get through the interview, but i would be at 20% tops as far as being on top of my interview game... and I think I'm being generous...probably closer to the high single digit percentages.

It was a god send as far as the energy it gave me and the ability to concentrate on my prep...not to mention the confidence I did not have leading up to this interview.

1263,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,No but Ive used quinine tablets for withdrawl muscle cramps and it really helps. The only drink Ive used for opiates is [grapefruit juice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9420451)
1264,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,I can't even find real Quinine water anymore.  Do you order it online?  The stuff they sell at the grocery stores contains barely any Quinine to be useful.
1265,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,"Modern tonic water contains considerably less quinine than it did in the past (when it was actually a malarial tonic). I’d imagine if it was as loaded with quinine as it used to be it would be unbearably bitter (unless you add plenty of Gin and limes!) so I’d assume that’s why. 

I think there’s something like 8mg of quinine per litre now, but that’s just off the top of my head and I’m almost certainly wrong so check it for yourself to find out exact numbers."
1266,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,The only opioid I've heard of people using Quinine to potentiate it's effects is Loperamide (Imodium).
1267,How much Kratom to avoid opiate withdrawals?,That’s a low dose so I’d say start low with the krakra and work your way up till u find the right dose everyone is different.

Any recs on dosage and method (tea, pills, etc.)?","I tried 1.5 grams and it helped but only a little, still had stomach pains and gnarly growls. Then tried another .5 grams to combine for a total of 2 grams, and I am chillin!!

Congrats on your taper so far!! Btw how as your taper? I tried going from 30 mg to 10 mg, and that was fine. Probably because I only dosed my 30 mg every 12 or 16 hours, well spread out, with sometimes only dosing 10 mg between each day until my next 30 mg dosage. I did that for a while, and it worked great. But then I had only 1 week of dosing 3-4x a day on 30mg, and my tolerance increased. 

So I decided I should try to taper just for a week or so to lower my tolerance. Going to 10 was fine, I did that for 5 days no problem at all. But when I tried going down to 0 mg, I still had bad stomach pains, restless legs, antsy behavior, anxiety. Not too bad though, but enough where I realized I was withdrawing.

So that's what led me to Kratom, and it's great so far. I would try doing 2-3 grams of Kratom"

I would start between 8-10 gs to avoid getting sick, then dose yourself based on how you feel. You aren't likely to get the wobbles, since you've got a high tolerance to opiates. But I would definitely start with that just to avoid getting sick. I need to also let you know when I say teaspoons, I literally referring to a level measuring teaspoon. Try not to use a kitchen spoon or anything as a guide because you won't get your dose right with that. The taste is bad, it's awful, but it sure beats the hell out of feeling sick and in withdrawals.

1282,Used China white heroin (never used an opioid before) for the first time a couple weeks ago. It was super underwhelming. What went wrong?,"Heroin is a little strong for a first opiate. When I see non opiate users try it, all of the other side effects often overpower the good feeling. If you're looking for typical opiate euphoria I would try something weaker like hydrocodone or oxycodone (if you can be sure that you're taking real pills).  


But all that aside, I would suggest not getting to the point where you have a taste for opiates. If you tried them once and didn't see what the hype was about, GREAT. Go back to your life. You won't have much of one if you keep doing H."

Now is the best time to stop and be glad it didn't work well for you. If you think you're in a rut now, just wait until you're in a worse rut and also withdrawing. I don't mean to sound blunt, but you're realllllllyyyy going to wish you went back in time and stopped yourself right here."

1291,Really? Everyone here talks about how euphoric opiates feel. If they didn’t feel pleasurable then why would people do them? And I have sever depression so I figured I would have felt something strong.,"I was surprised too. I'd describe them more as being extremely numbing as opposed to euphoric. You can imagine why a numbing drug would be popular among people who have been dealt a bad hand in life. Also fentanyl is also known for being more sedating as opposed to feel-good. Stimulants, now that's real euphoria.

Speaking logically, the best advice you will ever get is to never take recreational opioids again. If you're absolutely determined to try a new drug, which I would advise against, ketamine is probably the best option in your case and has less life-ruining potential.

1330,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,"It sounds to me like you got some other issues goin on.  Major depression? Or some other mental illness?  Or maybe your body isnt running right with some vitamin/mineral/hormone deficiency?

I could see if you just didn't do as much activities as you used to, but doing nothing but staying home 100% of a year only shooting dope and sleeping is a long fuckin time to do nothing.

You can't take the dog for a walk/ go for a walk in the park, or go out to eat, go see a movie?  Most of us Just don't have the extra cash to pay for movies or dinner out, but going for a walk or bike ride is free."
1331,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,It's a mix of depression and extreme reliance on the short chemical boost from dope.
1332,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,Yes. It happens with addiction. It doesn't mean depression. Its the drugs draining you.
1333,Yes. It happens with addiction. It doesn't mean depression. Its the drugs draining you.," Depends though..if you are taking Vicodin and gave a constant/cheap source, then I don't see why it would drain you..of course, I'm assuming you are taking decent care of yourself along the way..now, if you have an IV heroin habit and are stealing and doing other crimes to get your dope all the while rarely eating, sleeping or exercising, then yeah you will feel like shit"

1337,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,I imagine if I didn't have to come up with the cash to support my habit thats about all my life would consist of at this point. If you've really gotta get motivated for something just throw some meth into the mix
1338,I just read something I relate to so much. Is this normal in addiction?,"Addiction is only a small part of your equation. You clearly suffer from some kind of mental illness related to depression. The long term methods to turning your life around are the obvious ones, including exercise, proper sleep schedule, and social interaction. Obviously therapy, various blood tests, and likely medication are needed for you to recover. Now this is a huge double edged sword, but adderall might be beneficial for you in the SHORT term, IF you add it to the rest of what I mentioned. If you simply take adderall and do nothing else to improve your situation, within 6-9 months you'll just need adderall to feel the way you do now, and without it you'll feel even worse."

  Whomever made that comment sounds more clinically depressed than addicted"
1346,Can you overdose on suboxone?,"If you have no opiate tolerance, yes.  Also a chance of overdosing if you mix with benzos."
1347,"Hi again guys, subutex, suboxone or methadone?","Suboxone if you were on weaker opiates (oxy, codeine, hydro, etc) and methadone for H or Fent, maybe even oxy depending on dose."
1348,"Hi again guys, subutex, suboxone or methadone?","It all depends on what else you have going on along with addiction. Like myself I have chronic pain so my choice is gonna be straight towards methadone. I've had both, methadone is an effective pain med and for myself it didnt give the the craving effect like other opiates have. The only thing I'd say to warn people of is be prepared to either get on it then get off as quickly as possible if you dont want to be dependent on a drug, if your gonna do the long haul make sure you are gonna be able to get this script for as long as you want/need it. Most say that you'll never lose a prescription as long as you abide by the guidelines, dont abuse it sell it whatever it would be to cause you to loose it. I know otherwise. Drug policies changing every day getting stricter made it impossible to continue methadone after 13 years of an unblemished script history when my doctor retired. I simply could not afford what the few doctors that prescribed methadone were wanting. Second thing is be prepared to loose your teeth. Theses meds dry your mouth out so bad it is unavoidable, so be prepared to be very proactive on dental care."

Its ginger. But damn I was surprised. For me it Works better than any actual drug did for nausea.

1359,Why does heroin make life less boring?,"This is a somewhat philosophical question that deserves some philosophical pondering. I believe it falls directly in line with Lao Tzu and his “Tao Te Ching” explaining Taoism (Daoism)

“We mould clay into a pot,
but it is the emptiness inside
that makes the vessel useful.”

— Lao Tsu, Tao Te Ching quotes 11

Essentially - it’s not what a life “contains” that matters...it’s the creation and process of setting up the kind of life that is what is meaningful to the individual. Further, it’s how you create your experience and why you do it that makes it worth it (or not worth it).

So in your experience, you are creating a life that allows you to feel good about doing nothing. But if you did nothing without scoring, it would not be the life you want, and thus the boredom is palpable. When you score you know that you are giving yourself the confines of what you want, so whatever happens inside those confines, boredom, is much more acceptable to you and your mind.

A look into this can be seen as following:

However important it is, non-being cannot exist without the being.  A pot cannot be a pot without the clay.  A house cannot be a house without the pillars and walls. Money cannot play the role or exchange if cannot be recognised as a tool of trust.


Just a thought.


Not to mention...H dulls senses, emotions, fears, anxieties, etc. thus doing nothing feels like doing something, when high.

Ive used all forms of opiates for comin up on a decade and my girl used to sit up and tweak just listening to me sleep... I would apparently take one GASPING desperate breath every 45 seconds and slept like this multiple nights a week depending on how hard i went...

But every day I woke up rested and felt normal as fuck. Ive never once overdosed in my entire career as a dopefiend.

I used a lot of speed when I was younger. Honestly I never found it that recreational, I only used it for energy, concentration, motivation. Plus it was cheap enough to use everyday when I was still in school. It's euphoric, but different to oxy. It's worth a try I guess, but just note that if you rely on speed for energy/concentration regularly, it'll fuck up your sober energy and concentration levels."

1441,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,I wouldn't worry too much. Here in the US I can tell you that all of the treatment places ive been usually use one main medication to taper you off opiates whether it be oxys or dope you were using. This is usually some sort of suboxen or methadone. They usually add additional meds to help with anxiety and stuff. I have gone through the same exact treatment when I initially had a pill problem and when I became full blown IV dope user. What changed was the starting dosage of whichever tapering drug (methadone or subs) the facility would be using. Typically when you start the treatment process you will be dosed accordingly until your discomfort fades away. All you need to do is be vocal about how your withdraw symptoms are.. It really dosent matter pills or heroin. Best of luck.
1442,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,"Oxycodone does not show up under opiates, and heroin would test positive for opiates, they won't do just a standard 5 panel.. urine analysis kits have been around for so long, it's easy for any institution to choose a urine test that tells them what they need to know, or possibly test your blood, but they don't cater it to you that specifically, as stated above, u will get either Methadone, max they can give you is 30mg to start out, probably be more realistically 20/25mg, or Suboxone (Buprenorphine, and Nalaxone) 8mg\2mg, 
      If you are worried about them telling anyone else about your drug use, don't HIPPA protects your right to Privacy, unless you are considered a threat to yourself, or another person, in that case they are obligated t to say something. 
   The main reason they will drug test you is to make sure you in fact test positive for one opioid substance or another, since Methadone, and Buprenorphine are both powerful medications, they don't want to take the liability of giving a non opioid tolerant person a dose of either as it could be potentially very dangerous and even life threatening! 
   I've been in both programs several x and am very familiar with the process that take place in either the methadone clinic, and at a Suboxone Dr... Sounds like in your case you are more than likely going to b given Suboxone... Ns if you have any experience with it, but it's a lil strip, or a tablet you place under your tongue and let fully dissolve, I personally hate Suboxone, but there are others who swear by it, that said, they both do work to alleviate all w\d symptoms by 2nd day several hrs after 2nd dose.
    They will also in either case make sure you are in active withdraw b4 they give you either med as well, it's easy enough to fake this part if you had to, just look up all the symptoms of opioid use disorder ""post acute withdraw symptoms"" or PAWS, and memorize... A Dr will ask u a series of questions, the goal is to basically say you are currently experiencing as many symptoms on that list as possible 👍 how that helps you understand what is likely going to happen going forward in either case, good luck!"
1443,Question about rehab - does this really matter?,Tell them about the dope because if you don’t get any comfort meds it’s gonna be extremely hard to stop.
1444,Tell them about the dope because if you don’t get any comfort meds it’s gonna be extremely hard to stop.,"What ""comfort meds"" are you thinking they will give besides methadone or buprenorphine, definitely no Benzo as these programs are getting extremely strict as far as putting anyone on Either Bupe and benzos, or m\done and benzos, they might give you an otc non-stimulant stool softener, Buspirone for anxiety, Seroquel for help sleeping and really I don't see much of any other comfort meds being used that isn't otc garbage, or shit meds rx'd to you basically no one in the program will want to take.  Unless you can think of any other meds, that would be beneficial for someone suffering from opioid wd?  In jail when you get booked in you can tell them you have u 7gram\daily habit, and they will give you hydroxyzine, and stool softener, and Tylenol, my point being by law that is all they are required to do in order to help you treat the symptoms.

1505,Who uses “make-up” to hide scabs and track marks?,"Hey! A good option if you’re really committed to hiding the track marks is to first apply a green color corrector. That will neutralize the dark marks. You can apply it with your fingers and kind of buff, or blend, it in. Then go over that with concealer that matches your skin tone. Again you can use your fingers for that. If you really want it to last you can buy powder to set it with."
1506,Who uses “make-up” to hide scabs and track marks?,"I never IV’d, but learning how to do my own makeup years ago has been awesome in general (as a dude.) Everything from under-eye circles to scars are gone if I want. Great for looking fresh on little to no sleep."

I'm a girl and I have a hard time finding the right color foundation because I have freckles, but I went into an Ulta store (sephora or the like would work) and they have samples of the concealers out so you can try them and find the right shade.

1510,Is it safe to chug a beer or two on suboxone?,"A couple things to consider—

Buprenorphine is metabolized by the liver, so your liver health and overall drinking history and habits are worth considering.

The main concern with buprenorphine and alcohol is respiratory depression, where tolerance and dosing and bupe’s long half-life come into play, along with other factors (especially any other meds or supplements that could contribute.)

The biggest issue I see is....Natty Ice? You may want to see a professional on that one ;)

Edit — in another thread you said you’re almost nodding? If your tolerance is that low to bupe at the moment, I would not push it with alcohol. Being on subs long-term versus recreationally makes a big difference with respiratory depression."

One such doctor someone told me about I gave them 3 MRI and a stack of papers all from doctors anout all I'd been through ..hip surgery knee surgery and a wreck..and they still refused to see me because one of the doctors didnt return their call..its ridiculous..

They can be +/- 10% of the peak plasma level achieved by the name brand. So in theory, two generics could differ by as much as 20% in terms of peak plasma level, but can only differ by a maximum of \~4-5% in terms of active ingredient.

1548,Panic attacks?,"Hey dude, this could possibly a reaction to anything that your dope is cut with. Maybe some Strange new/old fent analogue or smth else. it could be literally everything.

 If you dont send your dope to any testing company then you never will know. It is also highly possible that with a new batch the panic attacks will be gone. Or in the worst case scenario cause no one says a thing your dboy uses more of the cut that is causing this and it gets worse. 

If I were you, I would talk about it with your dboy. Just be nice and friendly and tell him whats happening with you and your body. Give him a feedback. Otherwise he wont will know about that issue. I know that many customers are afraid to tell their dboy that their dope is shit but if you dont do it he wont will know it and wont do shit about it. 

Maybe he already gets his dope cut Like this. Then he has to make the same conversation with his dealer like you need to do with him. 

So the best advice is to a) send it in and get it checked (IDK about the USA but in my country its a free service or b) talk to your dealer which may be uncomfortablw but at least you will know two things ftom talking with him. 1) If he cares about his quality and 2) if he cares about his customers. I wish you the best of luck and if you want to know my opinion the best choice would be to talk to him."

1553,Panic attacks?,The only thing I can think of is that the quality is poor. It might be some minor withdrawals because the dose isn’t the same as what you usually take.

See I figured it may be the dosage, but like I’m scared to try and do like double or more just in case it makes the anxiety worse you know?  It already sucks with the small dosages I do lol"

Heroin should take your anxiety away but if you’re getting anxious the only thing I can think of is that your body is used to getting a larger dose of the drug. But again I could be completely wrong so don’t take what I said as fact it’s just my 2 cents.

I do appreciate your 2 cents though, thank you for at least reading my post, replying and trying to help me :)"

1570,Will three days get me past the worst of it?,"It will help absolutely. You will most likely feel some residual affects of WD, but some of that is unavoidable and it's minor compared to what you would/could have felt.

1572,Will three days get me past the worst of it?,"I’d conserve and save that sub for when ever you truly fucking need it and can’t take it anymore.  And no point should you feel 100% normal or comfortable because if so then you’ve taken too much. Wait as long as you can and take half a mg. Should keep you ok for 12ish or more hours but I’d wait like 24 before taking another half. But who’s really say what you’ll experience. They’re a so many variables in these situations. Your tolerance, how long you’ve used, how much suboxone you’ve ever used, how you respond to suboxone. Take me for example, if I was seriously going through it and had been using dope continuously for some time that 3/4 isn’t gonna do much except maybe keep me from shitting my pants, I’d still be a miserable useless sweaty anxious mess. Good luck"

1587,How much IV heroin for my first time?,Just snort it. IVing new white heroin is an EASY way to die from fentanyl
1588,How much IV heroin for my first time?,"Really I would just stick to snorting it at least until you've built up a bit of a tolerance if I were you

But if you absolutely have to bang it, snort a match tip size bump first just to gage how good it is, then go from there. If it's awful or decent or in between do 1/4 a point (a point is 0.1g), if it's amazing do 1/8 a point. Those are to start with then after you do the first shot you can see where you're at and if you think you should do more."
1589,Is it normal for a non-missed shot to raise a bump in your skin while shooting almost like you’ve missed it? I’ve been having this lately. Still get the rush.

1593,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,"If you can get your hands on opana you need to close this app and hit up your dude right now lol
..seriously tho.."
1594,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,"cause you snorted them, orally 30mg would have you nodding no tolerance"
1595,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,Hahahah fr opana is the shit
1596,Hahahah fr opana is the shit,"I wouldn’t call them shit, but  i definitely like oxy WAY more"
1597,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,Gotta hit the right dosage for your tolerance and it is bliss plus energy. At least for me. Oxycodone is the shit. If you’re looking for true bliss/euphoria in a pill then you need opana my friend! Oxymorphone is the best drug I have tried. Well opiates at least. My heart and mind still love mdma and lsd. Especially together. Morphine is boring. Dilaudid is alright. That’s hydromorphone. Look for those pandas duder.
1598,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,"Dilaudid fucking sucks ass, but opana is amazing so if you can get some you need to jump on that as quickly as humanly possible"
1599,Recommendations for sedative and euphoric opiates?,Apparently everyone is different. Oxymorphone for me is even more energizing than oxycodone and it doesn't put me to sleep like hydromorphone and hydrocodone do. It's euphoric for sure but I can never nod from it and it doesn't feel like noddy heaven right before bed like the hydros do. A puff of weed helps give it a noddy edge but sometimes it takes away from the euphoria.
1600,Tomorrow bright and early I’m finally tapering. I will be going down from 48 mg a day to 30mg. Then in two weeks down to 24mg. And stabilize at 24mg for a while. What can I expect? Also doctor put me on suboxone so it’ll be my first time taking suboxone instead of subutex,"How long have you been on 48mg per day?  There should be no difference from subutex and suboxone for you, unless you’re shooting it.  Even then many people say there is no difference whatsoever.  At over 32mg, I’m not sure of the side effects of the naloxone to be honest.  Most docs script under 32.  
 
The buprenorphine itself actually presents a higher binding affinity than naloxone does under normal conditions.  When people get PWD (precip withdrawal, after taking subs too soon following use of full agonists) it’s not the naloxone causing it, it’s the high affinity of the bupe.  It kicks other opioids off receptors, and doesn’t allow you to get “high” (at least not easily)

I imagine you’ll be just fine with the taper.  You can always ask for minor adjustments as needed; maybe even ask your prescribing physician for a direct(ish) number to call if your symptoms are too bad - if you feel lucky.  Maybe even ask to stay on subutex and do the taper if it makes you more comfortable.  You can always warm yourself up to it beforehand by taking bits and pieces less each day until your taper appt. 

Then you’ll even have some emergency milligrams to spare :p"

That is a very high dose and for many people the pain does not start until you get down to doses of 2mg and lower. Suboxone and Subutex will feel the same unless you have some kind of sensitivity or side effect from Naloxone. The naloxone was added as an abuse deterrent but is negligible when taken orally and most users do not even have symptoms when being reckless and shooting it. 

Good luck to you!  Once you get down to lower doses and if you feel any side effects, ask your doctor for some comfort meds during the end of your taper (if the goal is tapering to 0).  

Good luck OP!!!!"

1615,How do I snort without it going down my throat?,"Why would you snort suboxone?

Just take it as directed, there’s no reason not to. They were designed with addicts in mind, none of you guys are pulling wool over your psychiatrists eyes"

1639,[deleted],"I also wanted to do some more dope and get higher another reason I asked this question, so I can nod out...until I found out it’s lethal (which I really didn’t know). But I’m guessing I should just not add anything anything else to my system for tonight"

1641,[deleted],"Yeah, especially like I heard about some “chocolate chip cookie” effect? Where there can be some sweet spots in a bag of dope you got that can be stronger or if it’s cut with fent that could be stronger in some parts more so than others. What about a bowl of tree? I actually kinda had to smoke earlier to help the other two things start to really kick in, but don’t wanna make it kick in too much I guess."

1644,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,Xans and opiates is fun if you can handle both. But if you don't have a benzo/opiate tolerance. You're an idiot. I almost died mixing bars and OC 80 back in the day. Fell out immediately upon feeling the effects of the OC. I wish I could say it was scary. But I just remember feeling good and what not. Drugs suck but are fun sometimes. I guess. Oh well I'm on ketamine and weed rn. Have a nice night. Be safe.

1650,"As everyone beat me to it, its best not to. I learned the hard way and would always have micro-overdoses whenever i mixed xans and fent, luckily i never had a full blown overdose, and i never had the balls to mix xans and smack.",Well granted it was like 4:30pmish when I took the Xanax maybe like 6:30pm or earlier when I took the dope. I’m alive rn (10:47pm) and not even too high anymore so I guess I’ll be good. I wanna finish this last bit of dope up but at this point Id be playing Russian roulette lol

1652,Everyone's a soon just don't go hard on both,Yeah had me thinking I was bout to die. Well look who woke up today....
1653,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,All the times I went out like waking up in an ambulance out was when I mixed fent and xans. But I had a really heavy IV tolerance to opis and would pop like 10 plus mg of xans in a short period of time. Just be super careful if you do it is really dangerous I’ve lost a lot of friends. I wouldn’t advise it to anyone. But snorting the xans is a waste too anyways if you do that.
1654,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,I’ve seen a friend do it many a times.
1655,Can you mix Xanax and heroin?,"In order, I snorted half of 1mg xr Xanax I had crushed from a few nights ago, popped a whole 1mg xr Xanax pill, then snorted a few small lines of dope."

1670,Why does suboxone give me an amphetamine like high?,Same it's fucked do you IV it by ant chance
1671,Same it's fucked do you IV it by ant chance,"Nah I dont IV it, I'm always scerred I'll fuck it up and damage a vein or something. Plus my parents are super nosey and they'd find out eventually cuz I'm an everyday user. I just mix it in a tad of water and put it in a nasal spray bottle, I'll mix like 20 subs in a bottle and keep it handy"
1672,Why does suboxone give me an amphetamine like high?,Do you take any other opiates as a rule or only just the sub? Many opiates give you that energetic feeling with focus. If you don't have a tolerance and take a small dose (generally) you get that feeling bigtime and it lasts a long time. I usually do 4mg at a time twice a day and get that feeling within an hour of taking it. It's not as pronounced a feeling compared to when I'm totally sober and do a sub though.

I have never even understood why everyone wants to ""nod""? To me that's just a waste of good drugs! Anyway to each is there own! Enjoy it any way you can, and no do not mix subs with any opiate..."
1677,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,I dont think so
1678,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,"The rule with subs is generally less is more. I'd take 1/4 of it or a half just to save money and get more doses out of it. If I'm taking my first dose of the day, I can't tell a difference between 4mg and 8mg. I haven't been on subs long but long enough to have made that out."
1679,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,It won't if you stick at that dose. Anything above 12-16 (at once) mg IMO is a waste. Your milage may vary
1680,Is taking a whole suboxone strip a waste?,Don't snort it just put it under your tongue. You get the exact same effect that way without the possibility of losing some that you get with snorting it
1681,Is it safe to do coke and subs at the same time?,It's as safe as combining 2 highly potent addictive substances can be. Which is not much. But as long as you keep it in reason I would not expect much harm.
1682,Is it safe to do coke and subs at the same time?,"Nothing like a speedball. 

You're better off waiting until the coke is gone to take any sub"

1691,What's everyone's opinion on Ibogaine for recovery?,"I believe it to be majority ineffective, although some people seem to like it. I think it also has a “mystique” associated with it that it’s some kind of suppressed medicine, as another poster called it, and that western medicine just hasn’t caught up. In reality I think a lot of it is snake like used to bilk desperate people out of 10k in Central and South America for a quick psychedelic fix to their problems. There are going to be people who very vehemently disagree. I’ve known 3 people who have done it in real life and all of them relapsed. But hey, I think we should do some studies and decriminalize it and see if it helps. Maybe there is a process that needs to be followed through in order for it to be effective. I want to believe!"

1703,Most effective way to dose suboxone?,Intranasally is higher than sublingually
1704,Most effective way to dose suboxone?,"I wouldn’t even try to inject films like that unless you have micron syringe filters and experience using such a small amount of water to dissolve one. 

I’d just use it sublingually. You could try and dissolve it and use a nasal spray bottle to use it intranasally, but again you would need to be so careful about the amount of water you used for it to be worth it."

1706,Gotcha. What do you mean careful btw? Like be careful not to use too much water?,"Exactly, nasal sprayers are effective in how they distribute/deliver the water nasally, but they only deliver tiny amounts of at once, so you’d have to spray it more and more depending on how much water you use to dissolve the strip. And that’s all just to get one strip up your nose. 

A brand new, full bottle of Afrin nasal spray, for example, is 15mL so you’d want to use far less than that for it to make practical sense."
1707,Most effective way to dose suboxone?,"wut? Nothing and I mean nothing completely bypasses the liver. Maybe first pass, but that's it. 

Put them under your tongue.  They're made to be used that way. Their bioavailibility is high sublingually then putting it in your nose. 

If you don't have an opioid tolerance then shit the best way would be to shoot them, then you'll get 100% bioavailibility instead of the 95% or whatever it is sublingual."

Insufflation has I believe in the 60 to 75 % range when done correctly and a lot of people do it wrong. 

The strips are purposely made for sublingual, and I haven't check the percentage,  but usually when they're made a specific way, they have an extremely high BA that way.

Let me check and come back with an edit, specifically for subs.

Edit: well fuck me running.  It's got a very very poor absorption rate sublingually. 30 to 55% is what all the clincal data reports.  

I was wrong. Apologies. I'd figure the formula would be much better sublingually."

1713,Are you kidding?,uhhh no
1714,Can you get high off vicodin?,"Yes you can get high on Vicodin, that has been my drug of choice for 5 years. Youre going to need about 30-50mgs though, 20 didnt even touch me when i first started using. Also, alcohol takes away from the effect of the Vicodin, so I'd recommend not drinking until about 3 hours after youve hit your peak"
1715,Can you get high off vicodin?,What whiskey do you drink? I love opiates and whiskey
1716,Can you get high off vicodin?,30mg hydro is around 20mg oxy. 20mg hydro is around  ~13.3mg oxy which wouldn't get me high even without tolerance. So yes you can. But you shouldn't be liek that and start using google.

I'd just make sure to keep huge stashes squirreled away in various locations.

But for now I want to quit as my tolerance is just so high.  I don't get high any more, infact I feel mostly sick in minor withdrawals most of the time. I'm tired of being always cold, low energy etc.  I had much more energy, drive, and motivation when I was clean.   Even with an infinite stash of opiates I'd probably just waste my life getting high and doing nothing, but at least with a stash like that you wouldn't have to worry about chasing dope."
1731,Who wants to be clean?,"I'm OFF all opiates. I'm off all methamphetamine.  I'm off all benzos. I'm literally off everything.  I'm 30. I never expected to live pass 27. I always expect to be a static because that's all that I've ever felt I was worth.

I've realized, I'm worth more. I don't want to go back. I don't want to be involved anymore. I've picked up so many felonies this year. I think I had a total of 14 felony charges, 4 of 5 Misdemeanors, and I was still getting stopped by cops.

I've settled some of the stuff,  but I don't want to give up my life to jail. I don't want to stay in the cycle.  

Sure, if there was no social, emotional or physical impact upon myself,  others and the police. I'd get high every single day for the rest of my life, but there are consequences and I'm done with them.

1737,Very low dose subs enhanced high?,"yes, actually. and bupe can even behave more like a full agonist vs the partial it truly is, in minuscule doses like that"
1738,Very low dose subs enhanced high?,"How am I just hearing about this now.   
    any ideas on timing ?  
     Would it make sense to mix in .1 mg in same shot as dope/fentadope? Or do the micro bupe shot, wait 45 min, then the real shot?  
  Thinking option b"
1739,Very low dose subs enhanced high?,I’ve noticed this too! I’m pretty sure it’s because there is just more filling up your receptors and in return giving a fuller high

He's recorded me a couple times too and I absolutely could not fucking stand what I saw in the video either, but I usually don't get high when I do my shit bc I like to be able to stretch it out so that I don't have to be sick as much.

I've definitely done a number of ""talk to the camera/camera phone"" bike rides while on dope. I probably have those videos since I don't say anything incriminating in those videos.

I wonder.....

Usually if I was doing that, I was more ""energetic"" as opposed to nodding out. Such videos often happened while riding my bicycle to work but I've done it on days off. In fact, now that I'm thinking about it.. oh shit... I gotta check a video, I wanna see if I can correlate the date to determine if I was on dope or subs at the time."

1811,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,Yea depending on the brand (Mylan) and if it’s not a gel patch you can cut up the strips into small pieces and put under your tongue.  It will get you blown but be careful obviously bc it can cause overdose.  I wouldn’t recommend it ever but It feels like heaven.

1815,Have any of you ever sucked on or licked a fentanyl patch? If so how did you feel afterwards?,My first 100/ug h patch i cut about a fifth of and put it on my cheek. I woke up tasting the dirtyass carpet. Dont know how close i came to oding and dieing but it was more than i could handle at the time. Dident recall a buzz just finally getten to try these to realizing i was in the middle of the floor unconcious for an hour. Home alone gf had finally left to see her mom. Took all of 15 seconds from saying bye to playing with the patch. Prob on the floor 15 minutes after. All in all glad she dident find me the next day dead on the flooor...she would have killed me lol
1816,Fist fighting on Opiates?,"Stupid... I don't believe this at all but if true it was the benzos and alcohol that made you fight. Of course oxy will dull the pain.

It's hilarious you admit you got smacked up and couldn't land more than one punch... Then he pulls a round house? Lmfao. 

Hope your teeth are ok..."

Don’t offer people stuff or engage in conversation with random people. and you’ll probably have a better chance of not taking a “heater to the grill” whole situation could’ve been avoided if you minded your own business in my opinion."
1818,Fist fighting on Opiates?,Have not personally engaged in the fisticuffs but the dude I had been seeing at the time would get the opirage and decided to fight this other dude that I was just friends with and he (my dude) ended up getting tasered on the finger and he didn’t feel it until later. But that might have just been because he was super amped up with adrenaline since he was in a fight and whatnot

1823,Fist fighting on Opiates?,"Yeah. Me and my friends all took Xanax. I think like 1-2 bars each. I hardly remember what really happened.

We had 1 friend sober, driving us and we parked somewhere downtown so our friend could roll up. The 3 of us on bars got out of the car and started brawling. (No idea why) none of us seriously got hurt, one of them did have welts on his head tho. I was wearing a white hoodie, and the next morning it was completely green and brown. 

Our sober friend had no idea we were serious for the first 5 mins, and he wasn’t trying to break us 3 up when we were on bars. Lol. But yeah people get aggressive on bars"
1824,Fist fighting on Opiates?,Too many times
1825,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,"10mg to be safe and feel it, 15mg if you’re willing to accept the likelihood of nausea."
1826,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,To the best of my knowledge weight doesn't effect opiate tolerance at all but my advice would always be to start at a low dose. You can always take more if you don't reach the desired effect you're looking for.
1827,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,10-15 is sufficient for a first timer
1828,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,I would go 15 just to be safe but yeah you should be fine on 30 to be honest

1835,Oxy Dose For 0 Tolerance?,"10 to 15 is what I always recommend for a first timer. You can take 10 and if you're not happy after 30 minutes take 5 more milligrams.  Or just take 15 and nod out. The other poster is right though, you might get a little nauseous. Have fun!"

I don't plan on getting more though. Just want to see what an opiate high is like. I've tried many drugs but never really opiates, just want to get it out of my system and don't plan on doing anymore to be safe (I know it can be a slippery slope)."
1842,Smoke or chew fent patch??,Fentanyl has in general a short half life. So there wont be any difference between chewing or smoking. But smoking them is a bit safer cause it is possible that the fent isnt everywhere the same mcg amount on the patch. For example if you got a 100mcg patch there could be in one corner 40mcg and in the other just 10mcg. And for chewing you mostly cut the patch in pieces and then you could chew on the 40mcg or the 10 mcg piece so its more likely to OD. So I would rather smoke it than chew on it.

1851,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,"Now think of the opposite of that and you have withdrawals:

Going to work with just a dose of codeine to tide you by as you try a taper.  I'm freezing cold yet the children at the school I work at, are all running around in t-shirts.  

The environment is so loud, the lights so bright. Every little noise makes me twitch and jump. I sit in my chair in my office, and look at all the helpdesk tickets I've ignored. Work is piling up yet I am too dead to get out of my chair.

I spend my day in work in my office, by my heater, reading reddit. Kids are fighting outside my office (which is in a main coridoor).  I wish for them to go away.

I come home, to find my parents are pissed off with me as they have found some of my codeine 60's. ""You're taking those tablets again"" they say.  As if I can just stop taking them, throw them out, no worries at all."

I loved that vinegar smell and taste, the ritual, everything aswell as the high. i was hooked from the start. i would go out and chill in my van at 4:30 am or so when the world was still asleep and the sun was just about to start rising, on this particular day i went out there, (it was parked in my driveway, its like those vans you see ""vanlifers"" living in with carpet and a couch, recliners and a chest table in there, the passenger seat spun around and id go out there early in the morning, a rainy day on this particular day, and i plugged my gamecube into the outlet in there and ran an extension chord from my house to my van. id then sit out there as the rain hit the roof, in my cozy suburban driveway in the PNW, playing my favorite old games, getting super nostalgic about my childhood, and smoking tar. this was back before i got big into fent and tar would actually get me high. id take a little BB sized ball and smoke that over the course of maybe 20 min and actually be nodding out. ahhh, so nostalgic. then id have my boys come over once they woke up around 9 and wed drive to the river, open the doors facing the beautiful view of the columbia river, and hotbox with weed and crack beers while id smoke a few more hits here and there throughout the day.

Or the first shot I ever did. I just remember time stopped, and the music I had playing was all that was left. Everything went dark, and I woke up a couple hours later with a dry ass mouth and pounding headache."

First few lines of dilaudid were godly too, zonked for a solid 90 min best body high ever

Been blowing my bank pretty much chasing it ever since, sometimes I get close but it's never worth it."
1866,What is the high you’ve been chasing since you’ve started using?,"It was around the year 2000 , there was a foot of snow outside and I was sitting by the fire. I had discovered opiates and The Lord of the Rings. I think that was probably the zenith of childhood before the jarring cusp of reality and adulthood. I’m very happy now, but if I was forced to choose to relive one moment over and over again - it would probably be around there. I’m definitely romanticizing it in my head as things were not all good at that time, but it was before opiates kicked my ass and forced me to realize just how life altering they can be."

When I told the sub dr that and told him that sometimes I could fall asleep standing. I work on elevators so that a big fuck no. He put me on adderall 60mg/ day and that got me back in the game. I’m not naive. It’s probably not something a recovering drug addict should be able to get there hands on but whatever I’ve been on them legally for 1.5yrs and fuck yea,  Ive been known to take the last 3 2weeks before my refill is available.

1874,Would taking kratom while withdrawing from suboxone pro long how long I withdrawal for?,Short answer is yes. Long answer is its worth it.

1885,Will kratom get me high?,It may get you a small buzz. It may help kill some pain. But kratom is not a drug in the sense its gonna get you happily loaded. Too much and the wobbles make you wanna throw up very nasty powder . i take an ounce a day. I dont love it. Im better off with it. And i ussually wish i had a real drug.

Tramadol **can** be amazing recreationally. Really. But not for everyone. Some people swear to god that Tramadol gives them a oxy like high (without tolerance obviously) ans some people don't feel it at all."
1950,Tramadol...worth it recreationally?,"Tramadol and codeine. Each to their own I'm afraid. Try them and see.

Tramadol does shit all for me, and I'm prone to seizures so whenever I use it to bridge buprenorphine gaps I never go above 100mg per day. I've never got high from it. Sadly that's all my parents get now. No more unlimited codeine, then dihydrocodeine, then morphine, then fentanyl patches. Just Tramadol. 

Same with dihydrocodeine, on its own, I have never gotten high from it. Just a huge histamine reaction.

Now codeine is another story. I am an extremely efficient metaboliser so 32 hours off Subutex 300mg of codeine will give me a good buzz.

I have found codeine and dihydrocodeine to have good synergy for me. I find adding 200/300mg dihydrocodeine to the same codeine dose enhances the buzz, warmth and duration of the experience. I find with standard hayfever OTC anti-histamines it will dramatically reduce the histamine reaction.

Try everything you can in small doses to see what fits you. Each of us has a unique biochemistry and neurochemistry so each and every drug will affect each of us differently."
1951,Anybody else tired of clogging the toilet EVERY DAMN TIME from opi shits?,"I've punished many a toilet in my hay-days of using... I notice Methadone tends to clog toilets the most for myself.  Lol, definitely a satisfying scenario when u r finally free of a 6lb block o waste 😒"

It's embarrassing. I don't even put tissue down there anymore and have to be sure to cut em up if they're too big... My neighbour seems to have trouble telling me though, which probably inconveniences her more than it does me seeing as I tend to smell the issue after she does. I mean absolutely, she shouldn't have to smell my shit, but she has to tell me there's an issue for me to be able to sort it out. I think she's nervous of me or something but still she could leave a note or put one through my letterbox. 

I find it's best to start by holding a large bucket of water about chest height then pouring it all at once into the bowl, that usually will dislodge stuff due to the pressure. Failing that some sort of acid designed for the problem. Can get strong sulphuric acid here which dissolves pretty much anything alive or dead, for now at least. That always does the trick but I'm not sure how good it is for the pipes or environment (not to mention my relations with my neighbour), so I try to make this a last resort."

1986,Is nodding out a sign of OD?,"When you ""nod"", you can be easily snapped out of it and be moderately coherant.

I personally prefer doses that don’t make you nod, but the occasional nod can be nice if you have nothing to do.
If someone’s breathing gets really shallow or stops and they are unresponsive is where things get dangerous. Some people also asphyxiate if they nod in a position that blocks their breathing fyi, so if you’re concerned about someone but they are not in any obvious danger just lay em back so they aren’t slumped over straining their breathing"

2007,What are the chances of NOT having any fent in your H?,Get a tester at your local needle exchange if you have them
2008,What are the chances of NOT having any fent in your H?,"Never trust a drug dealer.  Light brown is normally ECP and likely there is some real Heroin in there, but Fent is pretty prevalent in ECP.  You’ll never have 100% by the way, but there is 93-94% shit out there (speaking from experience).

Only way to be completely sure is to test it.  Second best is to taste it or micro dose it, but as you’re a first time user you really wouldn’t know what to look/taste for and a tiny dose could kill you."

2017,According to google the nalaxone only has about an hour of effectiveness? So if as long as i wait over an hour atlesast if and when I do OPIODS I know I wont feel it all cause the bupe but you will still feel it right?,"what? feel what? still feel what? the high? no. its not the naloxone blocking it, at all. its the bupe. it has a higher binding affinity than naloxone, the nalox is mainly an abuse deterrent and for patent purposes"
2018,"what? feel what? still feel what? the high? no. its not the naloxone blocking it, at all. its the bupe. it has a higher binding affinity than naloxone, the nalox is mainly an abuse deterrent and for patent purposes",Higher binding affinity=Can you explain this in dummy terms?
2019,Higher binding affinity=Can you explain this in dummy terms?,"okay.. you have a trampoline, 10 kids are jumping on it. theres a magnet inside the trampoline - this is the opiate receptors inside your brain. 9 of your kiddos have magnets stuck to their shoes (these guys are your bupe), forcing them to bind tightly to the trampoline aka opiate receptors. 1 kid is jumping alongside them but has no magnets on his shoes, hes the naloxone. so he doesnt bind to the trampoline (brain) because hes so overpowered by the other force with the higher binding affinity, therefore this kid is negligible and isnt even in the magnet to have an impact. hes just kinda there. mainly for patent purposes, and for abuse deterrent (naloxone taken sublingually has nearly 0% BA anyway, but shot up it has  different affect which they try to steer ppl from doing)

does this make sense?"

2022,"Yah naloxone isn't the blocker. Its reverses the symptoms of an overdose but doesn't ""block"" opiates. Buprenorphine does","In theory it is a blocker. But it has a short half life, and bupe has an even stronger binding affinity, so it's irrelevant when combined in mediations like suboxone. But if you could dose naloxone every hour, it would efficitvely block many opoids."

2029,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,[deleted]
2030,[deleted],Appreciated lots! Really hope this turns out fine and all. Thank you 💜
2031,Appreciated lots! Really hope this turns out fine and all. Thank you 💜,[deleted]
2032,[deleted],Even with only a 40 mg tolerance? Damn dude this is gonna suck pretty bad then. I appreciate the help though
2033,[deleted],Also tolerance only 2 weeks 40 mg for sure
2034,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,I used it after tapering off oxy I used for more than 20 yrs.  I used the Kratom for 8 months.  It helped a lot.  It effects people differently.  I don’t get any euphoria from it like I’ve heard others experience.
2035,I used it after tapering off oxy I used for more than 20 yrs.  I used the Kratom for 8 months.  It helped a lot.  It effects people differently.  I don’t get any euphoria from it like I’ve heard others experience.,I don't think anyone will get euphoria from kratom after 20 years of oxycodone use
2036,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,If you have a heavy habit then it won’t do much
2037,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,"I don't get any euphoria, but find it extremely helpful for symptoms like bone and joint pain, restless legs, and anxiety."
2038,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,"Depends on your habit.  I was a very VERY heavy H user and tried Kratom for WDs a few times.  I always took copious quantities and it never produced a high, but it gave me some relief (again, in massive quantities) for an hour or few.  Really depends on your tolerance and habit.

One of my dealers was actually one of the early Kratom distributors in the US so I used to get it for free when I requested it when I was copping.  That dude ended up paying an undercover agent a kilo of blow to kill his business partner, though, so that connect dried up fast."
2039,How much does kratom help from withdrawal?,"Once you’ve got a habit it gets you good enough to go to work, that’s about it. I’d honestly take gabapentin over it. But gaba + Kratom and I’m pretty legit, can enjoy family and friends."
2040,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,why not just do an actual proper taper instead of this shit seriously??
2041,why not just do an actual proper taper instead of this shit seriously??,Cause I tried and I suck at tapering

2044,I dont have any help either its just me myseld and I,you yourself and you plus real opioids to try and detox bupe is even worse than just you yourself and you :/
2045,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,I got off bupe using kratom and had no withdrawals but now I'm addicted to kratom. Might work if you could actually quit after a week or two
2046,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,Yeah. I did this it worked for me but I didn’t use over a week. I got a gram and just rode it out. Took the edge off and used as little as possible tooting bumps until I was out.
2047,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,If your an addict it would be very hard not to develop another habit using this method.  I suggest getting some gabapentin really takes away withdrawal without starting another opiate habit.
2048,Has anyone tried detoxing off of bupe by using OPIODS for minimum of weeks to get past the worst parts of the detox of bupe and then you know you only have a couple days that suck atleast?,"Yes.  I could never get thru the bupe detox even at 1mg a day. I always used dope for while then detoxed from the dope. Even though the low dose bupe detox isnt as intense (id say it was like 50-60% intensity as a good dope habit detox) i just couldnt take the 2-3+ weeks of it.  Ive actually never known anyone to take subs longer than a week then taper off em n stay clean. In almost 20 years of using idk anyone to do it.  

My one sub doctor actually quit taking new patients for subs becsuse in like 8 years of prescribing subs he never had someone taper down and jump off them. He trulywanted to help people and every sub patient either failed drug tests or quit going when tapered down to 2-4mg"

I’m curious if you have ever looked into dissociatives for pain(ketamine, pcp or RC dissos) imo they are incredible for pain and can slow opioid tolerance if you use them together. They can be difficult to use and function if you aren’t experienced but I reckon they would be great just to switch things up every now and then cuz they actually stop you from feeling pain, rather than stop you from caring about the pain like opioids, and they don’t produce physical dependence.

Just food for thought cuz I know some people use 3ho-pcp and 3meo-pcp for pain."

Going in and out of consciousness but being aware that you aren't breathing. I've experienced something pretty close to that. At the same time I have friends who have died with the needle still in their hand so I imagine they went pretty quickly without even realizing it was happening.

Until you wake up under an emt who just hit you with narcan and is screaming in your face and you have no idea what's going on but you feel fucking terrible and everyone around you hates you for doing that to them and the emt finds your needle in and sock and tells your mother then you spend the next few hours in pwds probably at the hospital just for them to treat you like shit and then you walk home in withdrawals and sit outside your house til someone let's you in?!

There’s also a chance you’ll wake up being hit with narcan by EMS or in a hospital. Then you’ll have precipitated W/D for a while.

The vomiting was so intense it was the only time I've ever been scared for my life."
2075,Is OD’ing painless?,100% painless and not scary at all. It's actually kind of a bummer coming back to reality.
2076,Is OD’ing painless?,"It’s painless.  If you wake up, you won’t even remember it happening.  I’ve had tons of overdoses and multiple clinical deaths.

Problem with ODs, though, is they’re very rarely fatal.  Something like only 3% are fatal.  The rest of the time you wake up and when you have a severe OD and wake up, the results are often awful.

One time I woke up and my left arm didn’t work for three days, I was lucky I didn’t lose the arm.  Another time it was my left leg.  The leg went out for four days and would twitch and stomp whenever I put weight on it.  Again, lucky I didn’t lose the leg.

Even worse, I’ve lost use of parts of my face and head before too.  One time, the entire left side of my face went essentially dead.  It was hard as hell to open my eye and when I did, it was extremely painful and tears would flood down my face.  I also had no feeling in the top half of my head which was an extremely weird and oddly uncomfortable situation.

I do NOT recommend an OD and if you’re asking this because you’re considering it, reach out for help and find someone who cares and can assist you.  If you’re an addict, I know it can be hard to find such a person, but people do care about you.  If you legit don’t know anyone, fucking message me.  I’ve been there and it sucks, but your life is worth so much more."

2079,Is OD’ing painless?,"A fent tainted oxy OD is pretty painless from the people I’ve talked with. The guy I saved from a fent tainted oxy OD didn’t even believe me when I told him everything that happened. One moment he was snorting a crushed pill and he said it felt stronger than he was used to and the next he was throwing up in the sink with me supporting his entire body weight many hours after. I was lucky to be able to keep him breathing. No recollection of not breathing and turning purple, no recollection of the repeated sternum rubs, no recollection of anything. I was lucky to have been able to keep him breathing and awake. Hospital was only an option if I couldn’t do that. I’ve never been so sore or exhausted. It was hours of walking while supporting a full grown mans body weight and giving pain stimulus to keep him going. Everyone else I’ve talked to says they just black out and come to with the paramedics. The going is painless because you likely won’t remember it (but very ugly and scary) but the coming to isn’t painless and equally as ugly and scary."
2080,Is OD’ing painless?,Painless yes but You could also wake up as a vegetable. Gotta weigh the risks too.
2081,Is OD’ing painless?,"Yea. The most blissful sleep
Until the narcan is administered. Then all fuck breaks loose. But to OD and lose consciousness is quite blissful at first then of course you lose consciousness."
2082,Is OD’ing painless?,Mine were always painless and actually peaceful
2083,Is OD’ing painless?,"Yeah when I overdosed, I didn’t even know what was happening other than finishing the test shot, I actually thought it was bunk since I wasn’t feel shit, stood up to tell my dude that in the house and that was it. 

He said he seen me get out the car, talked to his dude and looked over and I was just gone. Like wtf. Here I’m in the road/ driveway, snoring between two cars, literally about to have told dude to not buy that bunk. Woke up in the ambulance after the third narcan."
2084,Is OD’ing painless?,"It totally depends on the dose and the person, not to mention the route of administration."
2085,Is OD’ing painless?,Ya but not waking up
2086,Is OD’ing painless?,"I’ve only ever OD’d on heroin, more specifically heroin laced with a lethal amount of fentanyl. I had no idea that I was OD’ing which I’m sure in part has something to do with the nodding; because when you’re nodding you’re unaware that you’re nodding until you come out of it. I just thought I was just really high. According to my boyfriend, I stopped breathing although I have no recollection of that or anything leading up to that. He did a sternum rub (hard enough to bruise me and scrape some skin off due to my clothes rubbing against my skin) and I didn’t feel a thing. 

The painful part was being narcanned honestly. I was narcanned twice by my boyfriend. Instantly I felt insanely nauseous, extremely cold and claustrophobic as hell. Felt like everything was closing in. I couldn’t walk and had a hard time talking or typing (I was trying to look up OD’ing symptoms of heroin and couldn’t spell for the life of me). I was made suddenly aware of my breathing which was incredibly shallow and chaotic. One second I was breathing very slowly and the next I was gasping for air. It was the shittiest I’ve ever felt in my entire life, so shitty that it’s turned me off of heroin altogether. It was traumatic in more ways than one. If it weren’t for being narcanned, I can honestly say that I probably would’ve just died without ever having known nor felt a thing."
2087,Is OD’ing painless?,"Yes, as long as you don’t wake up"
2088,Is OD’ing painless?,"Read on the bocthed US executions. 20 minutes of hell whilst the muscle relaxant slowly chokes you but doesn't allow you to show it and the chemicals burning around your pulmonary system.

Apart from anything else if it contains acetaminaphin that's a three-day slow death from liver failure.

Closest I've come is from alprazolam and not noticing a kitchen cabinet door was open. Hit it front on, broke my wrist on the way down and hit the back of my head on the floor. An inch or so from a countertop which would have killed me.

I still have the hollow on my forehead from the haematoma.

Whatever it is, it's not worth it. Take it from a dude who was in screaming agony for 7 years, no one believed me and I was taking 800mg codeine and 12 grammes of ibuprofen every day for years.

Two surgeries later, yes I'm out of work, but I have a family who support me, a wife you'd do anything for me and the buprenorphine keeps the beast at bay. Never getting off them just gone back up to 8mg from 6mg this week as I couldn't take the drop.

My wife works with those waiting for a heart and/or lung transplants who'd kill for what you have now. If you OD your organs are trash."
2089,Is OD’ing painless?,The time I od I woke up with the EMTs over me..while I was out I had a seizure of some sort...l had urinated also...it was super embarrassing...I felt completely fine..the next day though I could not move...my tongue hurt so bad and when I went down I must have hit hard...I was so sore and bruised..
2090,Is OD’ing painless?,"It depends. If you get narcanned and it's oxy with apap you'll die a long, horrible death from your liver shutting down."
2091,Methadone tapering?,"Im on methadone and out of about 100 people i think 2 got off it ,success rates are crap but there are sucess stories but just not many.
Now,its a lot cheaper to give out methadone free like gere than expensive inpatient detox.
Now were on it years but even if you taper ,depending on how long you were on it and what your highest dose was your gonna feel WDs.
One mate was on 2 mls for nearly 6 months and finally jumped off.
Still had crap WDs that lasted weeks.
Its the worst opiate to quit and anybody on it will say Dont start.
I made it to day 5 off Heroin 3 times but got so dehydrated they brought me to hospital.

I think my max dose will be 60 ml. 
So if I go down 5ml every like, two weeks or so, I’ll still be extremely uncomfortable? I wouldn’t rush off of it.. and I’d go down as slowly as possible.. I’d still have bad withdrawals?

And are the success rates low because it’s addictive its self?"

For first few weeks you do go to the doc 3 tines a week and if you give 8 weeks clean your put on the local GP who tests randomly,some dont bother and give you 4 weeks of scripts.  And i think its just cheaper to keep people on it. 
Its very addictive and dangerous to people with low tolerance.
60 mls would kill lots of people. In on 65 and its the fear of WDs that stalls most  from getting off.
If your on it not too long and do it with doctors help it can be done.
Its not impossible so dont let me scare you into not doing whats best.
Most people i know are 15-20 years on Heroin and then methadone.
Great at stopping taking Heroin but it is a strong opiate and addictive.  . Good luck man."

2105,Methadone tapering?,Methadone gets inside your bones . I’ve withdrawn so many times in my life . Currently 3 years clean.  There really is no soft way off of opiates.  Like it will suck if you do it cold turkey or draw it out longer with subs or methadone.  What helped me the most was gabapentin and benzos for a limited time and possibly an antidepressant.  That’s my experience

Hard to compare, as I've had sooo many more trams, and taken them for recreation & pain, when I'm sick the line between feeling better\getting high gets blurry!

2143,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"I have tried tapentadol a few times as well as tramadol. I do not like tramadol at all, because of the serotonin effects and weak MOR agonism. It's the only opioid I will always refuse, so far. I found tapentadol a completely different beast and very pleasurable. Stronger and much more of a proper mu opioid agonist than tramadol. I think the biggest dose I had, with little tolerance at the time, was 100mg orally, which was quite strong for me. Went into a very pleasant deep nap."

2145,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"The only time in my life I’ve had auditory hallucinations was once on tapentadol.

It was warmer than tramadol (and more potent) but my tolerance was high enough at that point that I didn’t get very high from them."
2146,What are Tapentadol and what do they feel like?,"That’s Nucynta homie.  It’s sort of like Tramadol, but stronger and a lot less side effects (and risk of side effects).  It’s strength is around that of Vicodin I believe, might want to double check that, but it produces a high most similar to a weak Oxycodone.

I’d say go wild.  They can be fun, especially if you have a low tolerance or fuck mostly with pills (e.g., if you’re a Perc or Vic user mostly you should be able to get a hit out of em)."

sucks that you got caught up. seriously sucks. im sorry it had such devastating and permanent effects on a part of your life that was important to you. i personally think that consequence is too harsh but i guess i see why they go so hard on cases with kids involved since there ARE people out there who do fucked up shit."

I always had good reviews from administration. My last eval was done when I had been up the night before on meth and used right before honeroom. Ended up buying dope and hard from an ex-student at one point when things got bad. I'm glad I don't live that way anymore.

Teaching was always a field i was heavily interested in, but i knew it would constrict the boundaries of my personal life tighter then i could handle.  Like some parent seeing me wilding out at the bar or a music festival or something of that nature and report me.  I also live in the Mormon state, which makes it more likely that i'd get reported."

2255,Has the whole banning flavored juice affected you at all?  How do you feel about them trying to ban it outright?,"Absolutely, flavored and menthol juice was banned here in michigan and it was easily 60% of our sales. There are ways around it but i lost thousands in inventory already. A lot of shops are buying bulk flavorless ejuice, as well as nicotine and flavor shots sold separately, customer combines it themselves. I worry that if i invest in doing sales this way, the governor will just end up banning that as well. I am willing to bet in 6 months when they ""review"" the ban that we will be able to get juice again but it will be FDA approved, and they will tax the shit out of it just like cigs. We don't make anything in cigarettes, it all goes to the state. I personally think it is about money, not health. If it was they would ban alcohol and real cigs too. Also think the timing is weird seeing as marlboro just bought 38% of juul and the ceo of Marlboro is now the ceo of juul."

2330,How many times per day do you dose? HALP ME BE NORMEL,So what is the end goal here? Do you want to get off completely or just cut down a lot. It seems like you are using a fuck ton of times a day. If you are trying to taper I would definitely start cutting out two times of use a week. So you use before you leave for work. Don’t do that anymore cut that one out too. Also cut out using after the 10 am meeting. If you only want to cut out one time a week that would take much longer though. So how about you cut out two times each for the first three weeks then the next two weeks only cut out one use and you will end up using when you wake up and when you go to sleep. Or just cut one more out and you will use three times a day just in case you start to feel sick halfway thru your workday. Hope this helps.

I'm always way too high at work. Falling asleep 1 minute into a meeting while standing up, nearly falling sometimes. Sometimes I'm nodded off then have one of those falling sensations, then I scare the shit out of everyone when I jolt awake in my chair. The worst was when I was in a Skype call with the IT guy and was sharing my screen, then he asked me to type some code into the console and it was just ""ipconfiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii"" and he didnt say anything for few seconds so I kept nodding off. That last one was just easy to blamed lag or the keyboard being broken. Lol.

Unfortunately I'm no longer a secret addict since my parents found the needles. They're the only people I wish never knew. I don't care if the rest of the world knows. I just feel so bad letting them down.

2351,Are new heroin users being made a lot these days? are they young? do they go str8 to heroin/fent instead of pills?,"Yes, your assumptions are pretty much correct, although the rate of new H addicts has declined due to the prevalence of OD's in the media and all the stigma that Heroin carries these days (excessive if you ask me, not referring to Fentanyl of course).

There are still approximately 1.5 Million Opioid addicts in the US as opposed to 400-500K before the Opioid epidemic created so many new & young ones, so the market will still be bigger than it has been in a long time (probably ever) but thankfully teens have less of a chance to be exposed through pills that flooded the illicit market like 10 years ago.

Of course things can change or even reverse in a decade or possibly even less time, but for the next 5 years or so it seems like the illicit Opioid user group will be pretty stable.

Infact out of my 20 or so circle of friends, one ended up straight on Heroin from other drugs like weed/coke -  I was the nerdy one who started off CWEing codeine then progressed to darkweb oxy.

Over here weed is the common drug, then cocaine. Also party drugs like MDMA.  Nobody uses Heroin or other opiates, other than the stereotype of the homeless H addict.

I left some oxy 40's in my office in work, the cleaners tidied my office and just left them on my desk. The boss came in and left a note on my desk about work, ignored the pills.  Nobody here even knows what oxy is. They were just generic painkillers to them. Here, ""illegal drugs"" are a powder or a plant.

Tried heroin for the first time at 21 only because it was much easier to find and much cheaper too, and it became an ""addiction"" very quickly for that very reason. I'd imagine it would be the same for many young people. Most 18 year old kids aren't just going to experiment with heroin for the hell of it. But if they try pills first, they already know what to expect and the concept of heroin becomes way less scary.

What about him? What does he have to do with you? Just because he is a dick doesn't mean you aren't.

You think that sounds supportive? ""So obvious""?! ""She ACTUALLY needed to be told this""?! 

You ACTUALLY think that sounds supportive?

It doesn't. 

It's not a ""wake-up call"" and it's not ""necessary."" It counterproductive and abusive. If you truly believe you sound supportive  -- and you may not; you may just be a passive-aggressive abuser -- you have absolutely no idea what the word ""supportive"" means."
2393,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"I'll throw in my 2c having been in similar situations. I think most people are correct in that leaving him and moving on will be your best bet. One is that he will probably always choose the drug before you. Two is that you're not his caretaker, it is not your duty or obligation to make sure he's safe, okay, whatever. And third, is even if he gets clean (which I doubt you've ever known him while truly clean), he may not even be the same guy you fell in love with. Drugs change who you are and how you act. When I'm clean I'm completely different from when I'm using*. And honestly, I had much better luck dating when I used heavily. More chatty, better mood, more calm and relaxed, less libido so not nervous around partners, etc. When I'm sober I'm a completely different person than that. Especially if he's using to self-medicate, finding the drugs that make him feel ""well"" might be a longer process than you're willing to stick with.

All and all, you're young, barely an adult really. You don't need to waste your time trying to save a junkie who doesn't want to fix himself. You deserve better and you shouldn't get caught up in the sunk-cost fallacy of thinking all this time will be a waste if you leave. Holding his hand can be just as harmful as leaving him outright, really depends. Bottom line is he won't get clean for you, for his mother, for his future kids, for anyone other than himself. No addict will. So let him figure it out and if he becomes a man you can love then maybe you can let him back in your life."
2394,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"you’re so so young, get away from this guy and never look back, hate to say it but he’s bad news, got no business w someone so young either. you don’t need this stress or the bullshit that goes along with it. ditch him and never look back before he pulls you into this black vortex of a lifestyle. he’s already hurt you enough. you don’t need this shit. I mean look, his bullshit has already driven you to drink to cope. stick with him and you’re even more susceptible to picking up heroin."
2395,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"honestly just reading all this made me exhausted, i dont know how you can put up with it. heroin addiction apart, he sounds like an asshole and you know it. addicts need support, but not from anyone. he needs professional help, not yours. he's dragging you down. you already know you should leave him, and he'll probably try to do some emotional blackmail to win you back. whatever happens to him after you break up is not your fault. if he was really trying to recover and be better you'd know. if he's really interested then he would do it  for himself and you can offer your friendship during this process if you still care for him anyway. then when he's good enough to be in a relationship you can reevaluate yours. with heroin involved you'll never be the main relationship. that's my advice as a recovering heroin addict"
2396,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"I really don’t see any reason why you should stay with this person; it sounds like he’s taking advantage of you, and it doesn’t sound like it’s really ever been good. It seems like you’re in the beginning of college? A lot of couples break up just bc they want to be single for college, with no serious problems (like their significant other being a heroin addict) even present in the relationship. “You the reason I wasn’t single in college!” might be big Sean lyrics but I have literally heard this said in real life as a weird insult / guilt trip.. just shows people regret that shit. I’m all for relationships but this one just seems problematic, and aside from the obvious problems everyone else is already going to point out, I just wanted to highlight that you’re at an important stage in your life. During college, you have school and your social life to focus on; if you add in a problematic relationship, you’re not going to have time for all three. These could be the best years of your life (they were for me, I’m not just repeating an annoying cliche)... don’t waste them on someone who is more focused on heroin than you anyway."
2397,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"Definitely leave the dude and dont look back. I dated a girl a lot like you (well, given the limited info I have about you) the first time I started to get strung out. That was 10 years ago, long enough that it shouldn't matter to me any more (certainly doesn't matter to her I'm sure), and I still wish I'd just broken up with her or just never started dating her to begin with. She was this bright light of happiness, genuine care for others and sweetness unlike anyone I'd ever met. I watched myself dim that light over the course of a year and didn't even realize it until a year after she dumped me finally. I've never stopped regretting it and still feel I haven't redeemed myself from it, probably never will. I cant/dont want to imagine what was going on in her head during that time. It makes my head hurt and stomach roll over. Unless you want to be dimmed too, definitely leave this dude."
2398,my boyfriend is a heroin addict................advice?,"First off, I'm very sorry about your situation. I'm actually a recovering addict with almost six years of clean time, and I'm still trying to fix the relationships I destroyed. If he's already injecting it then he's not going to ever get clean until he truly hits bottom and wants to change. You're young, and it sounds like you love him. My advice to you is to tell him that he needs to get clean and sober, or you're going to leave him. I'm sure my advice sounds harsh, but I do know that I've hurt so many people when I was using drugs. I'm not a liar, and I'm not a thief. But I was both of those things when I needed another fix to prevent going into withdrawal. I've seen so many people who ruined not only their own lives, but the lives of their loved ones as well. So, I guess it comes down to how much you truly love him. I wish you the best and I hope he chooses you and his family over death and destruction."

No judgement here (on you, but definitely on him) but you have to run. He’s in the midst of active addiction, where many of us have been. He needs a lot more help than you can give him."

Like this is the situation you read about on this sub from the dudes perspective where its a thinly veiled brag about how much of a stud they are for leading some naive fool on into supporting their ridiculous habit.

It won't put you back in Day 1 so you have to do it all over again (that is a myth - or tapers would never work)  - but it will set you back enough you'll regret it.

Being on that high of a dose of an extended release pill, could have your body in such a sedated state, even though you're not feeling overly sedated, when you remotely move, your body is working super hard to bring your heart rate back up, so THAT COULD be why you're sweating....but hey, I'm no doctor, just a stupid redditor who points things out, trying to HELP 😂 and yes, I'm currently taking 240ish mg a day of oxy 30s, so I MAY know a little something about the dosing etc after 14 plus years of taking them for a legitimate fucked up back.

2462,Avoid sweating massively when on opiates?,Also the sweating is caused a combo of our temperature regulation being fucked because thats just what opiates do and also I assume slight withdrawal caused by the drug leaving your body when your busy doing other things the only way to stop it is to stop doing oxy Im pretty sure
2463,Avoid sweating massively when on opiates?,"Don't let people get to you, sometimes you'll see a post like this and nobody will say anything about your dosage. And other times everybody decides to jump on you. If you wanna try going cold Turkey then that's what you should try doing. If it doesn't work out, I wish you the best of luck on the subs. Anyway back to your question. I found this with a pretty quick Google search. Maybe try some Benadryl?

""Opioids: Opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone and Dilaudid are a well-known cause of excessive sweating. Why? Opioids stimulate a type of immune cell known as mast cells that release histamine, the same chemical involved in inflammation, and that in turn leads to sweating."" Jul 31, 2018"
2464,Avoid sweating massively when on opiates?,"I cold turkeyed 4mg of sub a day for 2-3 years for 6 weeks before I relapsed out of boredom and because I started smoking weed again. It's totally possible to cold turkey a hard habit if you've got real will power. Most NPCs here on reddit will tell you ya have to go to rehab for 90 days and it's literally impossible on your own, but that aint true. Ive cold turkeyed many hard habits, xanax, massive kratom habit, suboxone, oxy, etc. It's not that hard if you're actually determined to stop."

2474,Anybody else have nightmares?,"Not whilst using, but the first night of withdrawal when I actually got some sleep, I would have some crazy intense , super dark dreams."
2475,Anybody else have nightmares?,"I almost never remember my dreams. But I usually know if they were pleasant or not as I'm waking up. So I can say yes, I have definitely been having some sort of unpleasant dreams a lot lately."
2476,Anybody else have nightmares?,I've had sleep paralysis and night terrors ever since I spent a bunch of time in the hospital watching my daughter's body give up. After the first week or so staying in that room since her mother wouldn't/couldn't it started to really fuck me up. Enough dope puts me out enough if I do dream I sure as hell don't remember it.
2477,Anybody else have nightmares?,"No, but I have dreams that I’ll find a stash of oxy and be pretty bummed when I wake up."
2478,Anybody else have nightmares?,"Yeah man, at my peak usage I was having nightmares daily. It was torture. I’ll never forget it. They went away after I quit."

2484,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,My suggestion is to just leave him be. Clearly if trying to talk to him only upsets you are not going to reason with someone in WD. He is miserable and misery loves company. I mean from what you are saying this is only his behavior during WD. Why even bring it up if it only lasts a few days.
2485,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,I turn into a real asshole while I’m in wds I don’t mean to be It just happens i get very irritatable and short no matter what I’m doing or who it is I hate being That way but it just happens

Ultimately what’s the point in dating if you don’t have some sort of thought about a future together, and unfortunately it’s usually next to impossible to change somebody you love that’s in active addiction. Wether realizing it or not, you are inevitably going to come second always, I just hope you figure this out on your own without needing to be stung first. Just my opinion though!"
2489,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,"Honestly, don’t try talking to him about anything serious, or having any prolonged discussions, while he’s in withdrawal.  Withdrawal completely fucks with your mental state and brain chemistry so he’ll be in rare form and likely won’t be able to convey any real feelings, just artificial anger and depression.

Save the serious shit for when he’s dried out.  During withdrawal, keep things superficial and short.  I know that when I’m in withdrawal, it’s hard for me to even hold a superficial conversation and I often get pissed off just having to engage with people for any prolonged period of time."

Its Not a good time to bring up anything responsible if you dont want to be rebuffed."
2491,How do I talk to bf when he's in WDs?,Limit interaction with him.  Wait for him to initiate contact if possible.  Don't put up with any bullshit abusive treatment though.  Just because he's miserable doesn't give him the right to lash out at you for nothing.

2503,"Any reason why they won’t potentiate? because what I’ve read and heard is that antihistamines potentiate opiates hence the promethazine in lean. 

Cheers mate ❤️","They don't ""potentiate"" what they do is make you more sleepy and it makes you nod off more easily. But it's not a technical potentiator. Technically potentiaters fight for the same enzymes in your body, which makes your blood plasma level of the medication go up. What you're talking about is more polypharmacy sedation.
Edit...cant type"
2504,"Any reason why they won’t potentiate? because what I’ve read and heard is that antihistamines potentiate opiates hence the promethazine in lean. 

Cheers mate ❤️","They do not potentiate in the pharmacological sense. A true potentiator inhibits or induces the livers enzymatic system in one way or another. E.g the typical one grapefruit juice (white being best for furanocourmarins) which affects the P450 cytochromes of 3a4 and 2d6, these are the most common for metabolising opioids etc.

Antihistamines can have a synergy, where for example your morphine (enzymatically produced from the Codeine) is made more sedating accompanied with Promethazine etc. Personally finding synergy in combinations is far more common and usually results in great results. My favourite being gabapentoids with Opioids.

Hope this helps!"

I am on day 9 now of only taking codeine (360mg 3 times a day),  last night I took 360mg didn't feel it at all.  This morning I took my 360mg and I actually got fairly high off of it - yet I was still chilly and achey.  The brain is just a wierd thing sometimes."

2517,I’ve been doing opiates for over 10 years and I had the BEST high last night !!!! But I definitely did a lot to get to that point,You did a lot as in a lot of subpar hits?
2518,You did a lot as in a lot of subpar hits?,I do pills only...I took 3 80s 😳
2519,I do pills only...I took 3 80s 😳,Oh man. Please be safe. X
2520,Oh man. Please be safe. X,I appreciate that. That was yesterday so I’m definitely OK I just have a ridiculously high tolerance and instead of just not feeling sick I actually wanted to get some euphoria so I bit the bullet and overdid it. But I doing that again when I can’t justify the money into it’s not the smartest decision
2521,I do pills only...I took 3 80s 😳,"Mind if I ask: are you prescribed or get them another way? At the height of my use I was taking ~ 3 x 80s (OPs) per day and I’m thinking of starting back up but holy hell it burns a hole in my wallet, I pay 45-60$ a pop for them (darkwebz) so it costs fucking a thousand plus each week."

Pain meds from a doctor would be quite cheap with insurance (maybe $10 to fill a prescription of generic brand, depending on one’s insurance). dealers usually sell at around .75 cents to upwards of $1 per mg (so $30 for a 30mg roxy). Yes it’s insane."

Yes it’s insane.",Depends on the doctor. But definitely is fairly difficult. Obviously if you have an injury or medical issue and you see a regular doc then you can usually get whatever you need.  If you get prescribed too much the government can cut you off from a doctor and the only way to get strong pain killers is through a free drug rehab like AODS. I get suboxone through mine. Isn’t as fun as getting a cocktail of fun pills that my last doctor was happy to dish out for me until I was cut off and he was given a warning. But I get a heap of services through them and I’m not risking my life so much. So I guess there’s pros and cons lol
2525,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,"To be honest I don't even remember much of my first high, I was so young like 14 or 15. I had bronchitis and the Dr gave me hydrocodone cough syrup. I didn't read the directions and took an entire measuring cup like you would when you take NyQuil or dimetapp. I just remember a warmth come over me while listening to music on my walkman. I do remember distinctly music never sounding so good."

Another big contributor is the current state of the Heroin supply out there.  When I started out sniffing dope at 13, shit was pure authentic good ol fashioned dog food.  Nowadays, most shit is Fent or a random Fentalogue and those range from “not quite as good of a high” to “what the fuck is this strange sensation”.

I have relapsed a few times in the last few weeks.  Prior to that, I was clean for I think close to 50 something days.  Now, if I get good old fashioned dog food and I blow a bag or two, I’ll get damn close to that first high.  I’m also not sure if that first high was as good as my memory made it out to be, it was my first time feeling that great so, like sex, I may have just built it up in my mind.

Just my two cents, but it comes from 15+ years experience doing just about every Opiate out there (I’ve done OCs, OPs, Roxies, Pandas, Vics, Percs, Tramadol, Heroin, U-47700, Carfentanil, Fentanyl, etc.)."

Same with opioids. Kinda off topic drug wise. But whenever I did blow with people I sometimes wrapped it up in some tissue or toilet paper and swallowed it with my drink. I love snorting. But I swear you waste some up the nose. From most of my reading on it it seemed swallowing compared to snorting was more bang for your buck. Unless you’re rich. But yeah. Tapping the vein was something I always seemed to abstain from. Probably a good thing since I’m such a drug pig when I get my hands on anything.

2543,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,Not true... still loved getting high the thousandth time.

Every time is like the first time & I've been using (low doses) for 15 years now.  Hydro/oxycodone, codeine, kratom, dihydrocodeine... whatever pills I can get.  They all give me a nice hypomanic energy in low doses that makes me over the moon.  

I think abusing anything will make it less effective.  Basic law of tolerance.  This is why people 'chase the dragon' for years in search of that first high but it's never to be found again.  For me, weed has been the most dramatic in this regard.  No high from ANY substance will ever be as powerful & amazing as my first weed high.  Now it just makes me anxious & paranoid :\"

2548,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,"This isn't a fact whatsoever. If someone uses the same exact dose say once every 4-12 weeks, and get this, actually follows through on only using once every 4-12 weeks, they can easily use for a decade or more without their tolerance going up all that much. I used to use just 20mg hydrocodone or 15mg oxycodone once every 4 weeks on average of \~8-9 months per year like clockwork for roughly \~6-8 years, before I eventually found access to cheap international darknet opium and ultimately obliterated my tolerance and started using daily/near-daily. It's only once you use near-daily or at least 1-2x per week for months or years, particularly in high doses, that you tend to develop permanent or pseudo-permanent tolerance."
2549,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,Abstain for a year or two then bang a Dilly or two. That will do the trick. It won't be as good as the first time but it will probably be very remarkable.

2552,Why is the first time getting high on opiates so incredible and every other time no where near as good?,"Its all about whether you have opiates in your body or not. If you use daily then there's just always some opiates on your brains receptors but if you wait a week therell be none on your receptors.

Going from 0 to 100 is more noticeable and more intense than going from 50 to 100.  That's why when you are sick you feel it really good but if you already used recently its not as much of a change.  I always felt like the first use after a week or more felt just as good as a first time use"
2553,Methadone & Clonidine ?,"I can't answer for methadone in particular because I don't take it, But clonidine does not really potentiate opiates, it just makes you sleepier and more likely to nod off because it tanks your blood pressure. It's really useful for withdrawals but not really as a potentiator. Maybe somebody will come on here and correct me but no...it would not be worth taking with an opiate and possibly dangerous. And no they would not test for it on a your ua. It's a very commonly prescribed blood pressure medicine"

The MOD team can't see who is doing it, but the admin team can. I have communicated with the admin team about it in the past but there isn't much they can do and this has been an issue for a long, long, long time. You are right. Someone is very petty and has some unreasonable vendetta against me. That's all I can imagine in regards to it.

I typically don't let it get me down and still participate a lot here. It can be upsetting though when I have something important to say and it gets buried. I also think there's a ""voting mentality"" where if people see a few downvotes they jump on the bandwagon and contribute to it by downvoting, and if people see a few upvotes they contribute to it by upvoting...

I don't know, but it is what it is, if anything can be learned from it, you get farther in life when you're respectful of others. I'm a huge believer in Karma. I've been through a lot. Some of it has been self-inflicted and I take responsibility for that. However, it seems I've got a lot of good karma headed my way.

2636,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,I agree with you for sure but sometimes stereotypes are real.
2637,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,Yeah this definitely should be a place where we should all be able to come and lean on each other and Connor in each other because we know we go through more Downs than up.
2638,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,"I think a lot of people internalize the stigma that is placed on them by non-addicts and in turn demonize fellow addicts. When people are treated like the bottom of the barrel, sometimes they react by wanting to feel like there’s someone beneath them too. (Could be in part a control issue here). I’m not excusing this behavior or condoning it by any means, simply trying to examine where the hate is coming from. I also think it’s entirely displaced anger since we cannot always get mad at those who put us down or fight back against the loved ones who think little of us so we come onto Reddit and unload here. You also make a good point about how often times anonymity makes it easier for us to be much more hateful when you do not have to suffer any consequences for your actions since no one knows your name and you don’t risk losing  any kind of reputation. There is also the fact that drug addiction itself is tiring and hardening. I have experienced people’s wrath simply bc they were WDing and obviously bitter about it and needed a proverbial punching bag. 

That said, I do believe that as junkies/opiate users, we should strive to be nicer to one another as this life is difficult enough without us dragging each other down. 🖤❤️🖤"
2639,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,"Withdrawal could be a factor here as well. People are known to have mood swings during withdrawal, I even got cross with a guy on my old account once when I was sick. I'm clean now and I do agree this sub needs more positivity."
2640,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,"Thankfully, everyone I’ve talked to on here has been pretty friendly...the people here are awesome in my experience experience."

Not really though, it’s just a really big dick move imo, like one of the biggest dick moves you can pull in these sorta subreddits."
2642,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,"I read an article awhile back, it was in a dug users magazine, it was about how we all needed to stick together rather than fighting amongst ourselves. At this point I didn’t think I was guilty of it. ...then I read how we’re all drug users, it doesn’t matter what the drug is. Before then I really against ice. I thought it was revolting, but I didn’t realise I thought I was better than them.  Since then I have made an effort to help people using ice as much as I help other opiate/benzo addicts."

We're all in the same boat more or less.
2644,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,Jesus Christ talk about victim mentality. Maybe people on this sub and mean and emotionally unstable because it’s the internet and 99% of people on this sub are addicted to narcotics.  This sub is becoming pathetic
2645,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,"If only there were humans behind every username on reddit.
Other than that, I'm with you 100%.
I was also on the receiving end of some nasty replies here a few times, but if I'm being honest, I probably indulged in the same behavior.
We all need to work every day to be better than we were yesterday. Towards each other, towards nature, etc.
OP I think I learned something today.
I might not choose to try to OD today.

2646,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,I feel like all of Reddit is in this current state of ego vs ego etc. it's sad to see and I get looked down upon for even mentioning Reddit to my normie friends

I agree. Getting a downvote isn't mean. It's normal!

However: 

>What has been happening to me is no matter what I say there are a few trolls up and ready to downvote me from the getgo. I may sound crazy, it's been going on for years. Meaning my comments, even if they contribute to the conversation in a positive way, get buried. It's been bad enough where other users go, ""who the fuck downvoted you!? or Why was this downvoted?"" So, it's a bit more than a simple downvote."

2654,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,"I've been lurking here for years and I see it often. It's disheartening. Between all the shit we go through between staving off withdrawal, dealing with dboys and plugs who play games, stressing coming up with capital for drugs or food or rent, one would figure collectively this community would be more positive. But due to the volume of people who post here and the fact that individually everyone's going through their own shit it's inevitable that people have bad days and lash out. Gotta take the good with the bad and honestly the good this sub does outweighs the bad."

2660,Can someone explain to me why are rude and nasty to each other!?,"simple answer: opioids make one rude and nasty.  ever heard of the term ""opioid rage""  I'm not talking about withdrawal either.  During the high of the drug it makes people nasty.  I didn't realize it until i got off them.  I though i was just naturally an asshole and had bad luck, but most of it was the opioids.

when i take them now (not dependent), i get nasty while high on them.  I feel great, but i treat others like trash."

2672,When d-boy gives u a bundle in one bag ??,Where I'm at buns ate 25. So a bun mite be quarter gram but like everything in the north east its straight fent. 10 years ago a 50$ bun was atleast 400mg

2674,Heroin with no legs?,"Theres like 30 common fent analogues and probably manymany more uncommon or notfound yet analogues.  Those test strips only test for like 10 kinds of fent, so it could be a kind that doesnt show or it could be some other research chemical opioid thats not a fent analogue."

But yes, it is absolutely correct that there could be an analogue that is not tested by the strip in your dope. I am not very well versed in anything beyond test strips as far as guaranteeing the lack of fentanyl, though. But honestly if your dope has no legs it's more than likely fent or an analogue. I got a batch of fentanyl dope a few months back and I couldn't fucking enjoy it because I swear to God by the time I was finished sniffing the shit it was out of my system lol. I hate that nasty stuff.

2688,What's everyones opinion on the most effective way to do multiple times!?!,"Best way possible, get a 3ml-5ml oral syringe (doesn’t matter which kind), put the dry cottons all in the barrel, draw up 30-40 units of water so they are nice and submerged, and leave half the plunger down for room and shake it for a minute or so. Then simply squeeze the solution into ur spoon (this way you can squeeze every last bit) and I recommend wheel filtering for any cotton shots. However if it’s within 12-16 hours you shouldn’t get sick. Never seen anybody else make up cottons like my method before, and when I was still using I showed tons of people. Hope this helps."

2694,What will 7.5/325 Oxy do?,"You won’t feel much, if anything. You can attempt to manage pain with OTC tools, but if that doesn’t work and you decide to use what was prescribed, you should be fine taking one or half a pill. They’ll last about 4-6 hours, just try not to use for too long a period of time to avoid constipation."
2695,What will 7.5/325 Oxy do?,"You might feel a litte buzz, 7.5 isnt much but when I first took oxy I took a 10 and felt it. If you have no self control then ya do the over the counter stuff, but I think you should be able to take them for pain and control yourself."
2696,What will 7.5/325 Oxy do?,"No need to apologise, this is a very sensible and smart post. As others have stated, if you feel you need more than NSAIDS or non opioid pain relief, at that dose you should be fine to take the edge off, as your Dr has prescribed. 

There should be very little Euphoria if any at all. You may get some relaxation,  which will help your recovery. Good luck!!"
2697,What will 7.5/325 Oxy do?,"honestly I got hooked on just 60mg of codeine.  60mg of codeine is a tiny negligible dose, I barely noticed it - but when I was sat playing a video game after the drug, I noticed something was different. I was more content, I felt good.   A few days later I remembered this being odd and researched codeine.

Pandoras box was opened and now my tolerance is 480mg of oxycodone a day. plus dihydrocodeine, and tramadol.    Literally off that 60mg dose. I remember it like it was yesterday."

2735,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"I was the user dating a non user and he had no idea that I was using up until the last like 6 months because apparently I wasn’t as on my game with keeping my shit together. 

It was super hard because of all the lying and denial and having to hide shit. And definitely wasn’t fair to them because they totally ended up feeling like THEY were the crazy one because they could see something was up but wouldn’t get a straight answer from me (obviously). So it was definitely a hard situation to be in."

It lead to me thinking that it was all my fault. And inevitably we ended up using together cause I was too weak to say no. The relationship ended horribly and we don't speak anymore. Took some time to get over it all due to some circumstances that were out of my control.
2737,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"I think it's 100% up to you to be honest, or you dont have to be, but at that point what's the point of being with someone you can't trust and share your life with...? 
Maybe initially I wouldn't bring it up on the first date, but I've never lied about my use to my long time girlfriend. She inspires me to do better. I look up to her because she's growing as a person and it makes me want to change. I started using fairly young, myself and was lucky enough to have a supportive family/girl who I can trust.

I've felt guilty about letting her ""party too hard"" but at the same time accept responsibility to the fact that I am the source of these party favours and it's up to me to keep her safe if I'm doing anything w her. You have plenty of options, good luck homie."
2738,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"**Start getting shit done and it won't matter!** I'm a decade into this. First just weed and pills for five years and then suddenly im doing oxy and banging street dope for another five, grew weed and did crime to feed my habit(not in the US, Im European), but you know how it goes.... I met a girl, and she got me straight.... No, not sober. She is though.  But I promised that I will never ever again commit a crime that harms another person physically or financially. She's tried to make me quit several times, but it never works for long. My longest is a month. This just seems to be how Im wired (I know its because my brain is fucked up from all the dope, spare me). So anyway I'm still doing drugs whats my point here? My point is, that is it really your addiction thats stopping you, or is the addiction just an excuse for you to not do anything else. because the dope helps you not care about what a loser you are? Really ask yourself. Why are you not doing anything with your life? is it because all your time is spent chasing drugs and shooting up? Well that is straight up bullshit. I am just now finishing a college god damn degree, from a good school no less, right now and I am a stone cold crazy speedballin' junkieman, and if I can do it, anyone else can. You will feel better about yourself and your life once you start getting things done! You'll rely less on drugs, and maybe eventually reach some kind of stability? Maybe start slow and just go outside for walks or something each day, get a shit job or something, just do something *besides* dope.

Your girlfriend will love you for it. And if she really does love you, she will be angry with you and there will be fights, but she won't leave as long as you try. Once you stop trying they're gone, man. You can have a good relationship with someone who does not use, as long as you put in the same effort they do but thats just every relationship. If one person isn't putting in any effort in that relationship it is DOA.  You also don't lie about your use constantly. You can never lie about it really, you have to be as honest as possible. Just tell them that you're noddy because you did H not because you're sleepy, just fucking say it. They will be mad but telling them is far better than lying and building up that poisonous doubt. If you are doing things in your life that are not just drugs then you might just be fine. My relationship works because my girl understands that i have serious anxiety issues that have to be treated some way, and the medical system has fucked me over so bad i refuse to see a doctor and so i ""self-medicate"". I also have pains from various injuries and a bad back. So she knows about the opiates and the benzos and has tried to get me to quit but she has kind of given up. I mean, i cause no trouble, I am always good to her, and I work my ass off both at work and school, do my absolute best to at least appear sorta normal around her and she appreciates that. However, sometimes I just splurge and will be a mess, but If all I did was lay around and shoot dope like i did before i met her... she would leave immediately.

So sometimes i choose and embrace the dirty junkie that i am, and at others i try to focus on more productive things, like higher learning. See, i think this is the problem and one huge mistake, an assumption that people make that you can only be either or. You're either a dirtbag do nothing junkie, or you hold down a decent job and have a functioning life with a wife devoid of anything that might accidentally be pleasurable. Me, i happen to have accomplished something inbetween as far as it seems, though its likely that i will die of some sort of overdose at a young age, i do combinations of huge doses of stuff that should kill me, like at least oxy 180mg crushed, some ketamine, alotta benzoz and at least a handle of whiskey, all at the same time which is mostly why my gf hates what i do, but she understands why and where its coming from, and thats just the best thing. And i respect her respecting me, by never ever doing that shit around her. Maybe that's the secret to our relationship really? idk. but if ur person doesn't like you getting high, don't get high in their presence.

But god damn stop making excuses, if you're the kind to just lay around. The only reason you haven't done something is because you haven't put the effort in, life's hard for everybody so buckle up bucko and earn that speedball at the end of the week. Think of your drug ""problem"" thats keeping you down instead more of as a ""reward system"", that you get for working hard. It will actually trick your brain, because you want that reward right... you NEED it... so go do your damn shift.

You will have more respect for yourself, and your girlfriend will respect you also, if you just keep at it and get stuff done. This isn't even some ""bootstraps"" speech, you might have a shit job your whole life... but holding that job down will mean something."
2739,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"Don't ever let the woman you love smoke heroin because you need/want more dope. You more than likely will drag her down. Unless you are actively trying to get help you aren't being fair to her. Drugs will always come before her. Especially if you're getting sick. I've gotten numerous girls addicted to pills etc just by keeping them around me. Eventually they want to try this stuff that is so important to you. The girl I ""let"" smoke heroin. She ended up linking with ""friends"" of mine behind my back and using her parents money to IV pills. I don't think she would have ever done that has she not been exposed to the scum I scored from."
2740,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"My partner has been a heavy codieine addict for 15 years. She almost destroyed us financially and probably will in the future. She lies about it constantly...but I know when she's using. She looks so ill when she's heavy using and denies it even when caught. She's tried to get help but lies to the people trying to help her. She's lied and stole from everyone she loves. It's destroyed me but I'm stuck. I hate her having this hold over me as if I tell anyone it will ruin her. We have a child and I do not know if she is safe to look after her some days. There's no talking to her about it as she is a compulsive deluded liar in fear of losing everything...and by everything I mean sometimes her next hit/fix/hand full of tablets. 

So if you're worried then there's obviously something to worry about. You will at some point have to choose. Junkie or not. Or...just find yourself a user as a partner and spiral into coma's together safe in the knowledge that you both used and it wasn't your fault."
2741,is it selfish to be in a relationship with a non-user? experiences VERY welcome. please share. i don’t know what to do.,"The short and honest answer is yes, in my opinion. It’s probably possible for it not to be in very unique circumstances, but for most cases, it is selfish.

It’s a complicated question, to be sure. Rationalizations that one is protecting the other from pain in some way are just too easy to believe in, in the face of the challenges addiction presents."

2812,CWE for naloxone?,"Its ok. The first time it was a great buzz but after 5-10 times its just ok. Feeling a bit sedated, no euphoria. Just a bit stronger than Tramadol. And once you have done the hard stuff it just helps keeping the wds at bay."

2818,How long for buprenorphine tolerance to go down?,"A few weeks atleast. Bupe tolerance builds insanely fast. I can go weeks without taking it, get high as a kite the first day, sort of high the second day then feel nothing every day after that"
2819,"A few weeks atleast. Bupe tolerance builds insanely fast. I can go weeks without taking it, get high as a kite the first day, sort of high the second day then feel nothing every day after that","This is completely wrong, bupe tolerance does not build fast. If bupe tolerance went up fast, so would your dosage when on Suboxone.  Bupe is used because you do not have to continue to increase dosage."
2820,"This is completely wrong, bupe tolerance does not build fast. If bupe tolerance went up fast, so would your dosage when on Suboxone.  Bupe is used because you do not have to continue to increase dosage.","No you’re not totally wrong. What I meant as for your tolerance going up fast, recreationally, your tolerance will build in that sense. It will still be affective for maintenance treatment, and will be useful even at a lower dose, you just won’t get high. So yeah I’m not wrong but you’re also not right."
2821,"No you’re not totally wrong. What I meant as for your tolerance going up fast, recreationally, your tolerance will build in that sense. It will still be affective for maintenance treatment, and will be useful even at a lower dose, you just won’t get high. So yeah I’m not wrong but you’re also not right.","No your wrong, your talking about half life. When using recreational opiates they have a short half life, allowing you to get ""high"" and then come down ""low"" over a period of about 8-12 hours. Bupe's half life is incredibly long, for an opiate, so, over a period of say 24 hours, one dose of bupe will keep you ""high."" Taking bupe every 4 days or so allows you to dose, get high, come down and then repeat the process. If you dose bupe every other day or every day, you don't really come down you stay in a perpetual high which after a week or so, doesn't feel like you're high anymore, it becomes your new normal. So, you remove the Bupe and you get WDs. 

The other reason bupe is prescribed is because it also has a ceiling. For me, it's 8mg or so. Meaning, I can take 60mg and feel no difference between them.
TLDR: Bupe is used because people do not have to keep increasing dosage, and because it's safe with a ceiling, preventing ODs unless you combine with something like a benzo."

So when I would take it recreationally, I’d have about 3 days I could feel it then it wouldn’t do anything but I would need to wait 2 weeks or so before I could get high off it again. That’s where the tolerance from it would be built up. It still would have an affect on me and not allow me to have withdrawals but it would need to be out of your system before it would allow you to feel high off of it again. It was also the same where after about 8mg the affect would top out and it would be a waste to take anymore, so when I would do it recreationally, I could take 30mg if I wanted and not be any more high than if I would take 8-12mg."
2823,"This is completely wrong, bupe tolerance does not build fast. If bupe tolerance went up fast, so would your dosage when on Suboxone.  Bupe is used because you do not have to continue to increase dosage.",Maybe there’s a better thing to call it other than tolerance but the quested asked was how come I can’t get high off bupe after getting high from taking it for consistent days in a row. Well because it builds up in your system fast and then won’t give you a high once you’ve reached that point. Would that not be considered your tolerance going up? I take 8mg a day and have for 4 years. I have also came off it and took it recreationally and got high the first few days then did not anymore after that.

But yeah, if you're a chipper, and 30mg oxy gets you high, 200-300mg codeine should do you right, and keep you out of SE Asian jails.

I used to get mad when I'd hear people call oxy ""synthetic heroin"", well technically they are both semi-synthetic opioids, but there is ignorance in that statement.... wait maybe not so much, because I get what they really meant now. There truly isn't much difference between oxy, opana, dilaudid, morphine, even hydrocodone, and heroin. Subtle differences yes but essentially they are all in the big leagues, the same animal, same euphoria and effects (and addiction and withdrawal) all on an equal enough level.

All the best opifam","I'm not up to date on their composition since reformulation. For the most part the biggest concern are particles under 50 microns in size as cigarette filters and cotton is essentially worthless for them. They will build up in your bloodstream (can't dissolve, but get injected and caught in small vessels), and especially places you really don't want them like vessels in your lungs. Yeah, it's fucking weird, but snorting and injecting pills will actually fuck up lungs pretty well over time. With years of it on you, I would really strongly advise doing all you can to stop further damage. It will cost you in yield and filters, not huge, but let's face it most opiate addicts aren't big on waste eh?

There is some additive common in pills that rides the line between soluble and insoluble in water, and idiots that cook their shots manage to push it over the edge into soluble territory, where it promptly precipitates in one's bloodstream. I am drawing a blank right now, but cold shots are highly important with pills especially.

Here is an excellent article explaining exactly how effective common filters are and what loss you can expect with them. It's based on MSContin, but will still apply for your situation. Biggest difference is likely to be whatever the current outer coating is, which I am not up to date on. Sorry. Strongly recommend reading the first few paragraphs at least, along with any sections on filtering methods you are willing to consider.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803777/

Ideally you would crush your pill(s) and cold water extract that, leave the solids. Then cotton/cig filter or equivalent, then wheel filter/micron filter. If you rinse a time or two you are looking at 80-90% yield of the good stuff with virtually no particulate, insoluble or semi soluble.

The cotton/cig filter before micron filter can be skipped and exists more to prevent clogging and thus accidental or frustrated bypassing/other loss.

Those little filters you are talking about, I assume I have had them before from an exchange. They are roughly equivalent to a cig filter in filtering ability but without added risks.

If you were a powder/tar user I wouldn't be stressing this nearly as much. Not if you just occasionally injected pills. Hope you look into this. That literature is useful, I promise. If you want to avoid nasty health complications 5+ years down the road the costs of playing it safe now have to be paid.


Microcrystalline cellulose isn't water soluble technically. In a basic/caustic and hot solution it does edge into soluble territory. Shouldn't be a significant issue, but with basic enough water in a boiled shot a small amount (small) is going to dissolve and crash out in the blood."

Much Love","No problem friend. Not much to do when it comes to vascular damage unfortunately. That plaque build up will be in part from naturally occurring stuff like ""bad"" cholesterol and whatnot, but be compounded with those particulates introduced. It hardens veinous tissue and kills elasticity. It creates blockages. The best thing you can do is limit further damage, and as odd as it is, mind your diet when it comes to cardiovascular health. If you get on top of it now hopefully it never results in some unfortunate bullshit like pulmanary embolism, stroke, or other nasty event. Not saying it will happen if you don't. Just that the odds really swing in the wrong direction.

I can't believe I am telling someone to mind their diet for cardiovascular health. I do a shit job on that myself.

Do you think I can sterilize used PTFE .22ug wheel filters i used earlier this week with isopropyl alcohol?? to use again? they are autoclavable but i have no idea where to access an autoclave.. 

Also Id like to sterilize an oral syringe that i used to draw up my shot and push it thru the filter.. does anyone think iso do the trick for me??

Cheers","Autoclaves... Only way I imagine one gets access to one of those easily is being in good with an OR nurse or tech. Anyone who sterilizes medical equivalent on a regular basis. Maybe a surgical vet place if you know someone. I'm not sure where else to look. You can definitely buy one, but not exactly cheap. Amazon and especially Alibaba have them. Possibly eBay. Probably 500 entry though.

Ovens get hot enough on cleaning cycle, 800+, to near instantly sterilize technically. With a convection fan system it would *probably* work in a second or two. That involves breaking the locking mechanism and is a fire risk (so you can open during it). Might have done that to turn an oven into a pizza oven... Not sure if the plastic will appreciate more than a flash or two either. Also not a moist heat. It would work, but it's sketchy for not health related reasons and if you are renting there will be displeasure.

Those filters are still going to clog eventually. Not nearly as fast with 2 stage filtering, but how many uses if you sterilize I just don't know. You can disinfect, not truly sterilize, with isopropyl or boiling water. The issues with isopropyl, and more so boiling water, is the rapid regrowth of bacteria. Say you kill 1,000,000,000 out of 1,000,000,002 bacteria with isopropyl. Given a 24 hour period you are back to thousands of bacteria. Used as soon as it is fully dry, the probability you are going to be fine is good, just not 100% ya know? Even enough dead bacteria can become an issue over time too, granted it takes a lot. A not great example, but it gives the picture, say you lost a Tupperware of food in the fridge for a few months. It's gross, bacteria have colonized it thoroughly. You throw it in an oven and take it up to the 600F range. Ignore that some is burned. The inside is sterile, but it's still gross and may likely make you sick. You won't get salmonella or whatever it was poisoning, but those toxic byproducts in their corpses are still there.

Point is that non live bacteria isn't entirely washing off in a iso bath when it can hide in filter pores. An oral syringe? Fine for many washes, but those tiny pores less so. 

An autoclave is just pressurized steam, so maybe a pressure cooker rigged up with some creativity is doable. Probably would take distilled water and a stainless steel rack, but if you can keep the plastic from melting it would do the same thing. Distilled because while other water will become safe through use in the process, it does have minerals etc that may build up on that filter quick due to surface are and clog and harden it. Fast enough to matter? No idea. 

Really spitballing there. I never reused them, but I had them in bulk cheap. I know some have to drop 2-3 bucks a pop which is not great. I would rig a pressure cooker into an autoclave, but only after testing how many times you can get before one clogs or tears. Is it worth the effort?

The syringe should be fine with an iso wash, but clean it after use, and then again hit it with iso before use ideally. It's not technically staying sterilized unless you can close off it's eviroment after by vacuum sealing. In theory anyway. Not sure how many would actually bother with that, but iso is near free and evaporates quick. It's how I handled my tar drip syringe when I went intranasal over IV.

Not super helpful, but maybe you can get an extra use or two out of those filters. Regardless if you find a way to sterilize I don't think they should be reused too many times. They are eventually going to clog or rip on a microscopic level I imagine. I don't have any idea where to draw that line and no literature. If you make it safe from biological hazards it is still better than no micron filter as long as it doesn't break mid use.

Sorry for the ramble, I just don't have much literature I can access on this. Bluelight is the place to try for someone who does. They had an opiate, IV, and pill subforums and some PHD packing regulars back in the day at least with dozens of threads on proper technique. Just can't recall much on reuse of micron filters."

3039,Long term issues from collapsed veins?,"Hey /u/OpiatedMinds! I haven’t posted on this sub in a very long time and glad to see you’re still kicking. 

Anyway back to the topic. My hands and wrists veins had accumulated scar tissue from years of IV use. Like you mentioned, my hands would fall asleep in no time if I ended up nodding out on my arms or dangling to the side. But I’ve cut back a lot since jumping back on methadone and lost connects (5-8+ shots/day to 0-4/month). I think my veins had the chance to repair since I find myself having little to no problems registering a hit and doesn’t fall asleep or get cold as fast as before.

A few years back, this one friend of mine caught my attention with how swollen his hands were for a guy who works out (was a heavy IV user but switched to smoking BTH due to no good veins). Not to be mean but it reminded me of Mickey Mouse hands lol. I’ve seen it mentioned in some articles as “puffy hand syndrome”.

3046,Oxy safe to take with coke?,"There is no drug interaction but there is a danger you will take more of a depressant ( in this cause oxy ) then normal because the stimulant negates the sedative.

3064,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Are you sure they are real oxy and not pressed fent? Cause fent is probably going to be a lot rougher
3065,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Depends on the daily dose of oxy. Your activity level will most likely shorten your withdrawal duration but might not lessen the intensity. Taper down if you can and jump from a smaller point.
3066,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Just taper off.  You may not have any acute withdrawal symptoms if you do that.
3067,"In shape, runner. How bad will detox be?",Are they 5mg or 80mg? Bit of a difference. Having never been in that kind of shape myself I can only assume your detox will be 10x worse than normal

3073,Would snorting vs oral make a difference by way of bioavailability? I only snort them,"Tolerance and metabolism and bioavailability are so individualized. I would guess theoretically snorting it might be slightly less bioavailability so therefore slightly less per dose. But honestly if you've been taking 2 to 3 A-day for a while, despite the route of administration, you're gonna have to deal with their withdrawals. Maybe somebody will correct me but I can't imagine it making that much of a difference"

3079,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,"benzos just make me feel flat and depressed and drugged.  never got high off them  apart from when i first did 5mg diazepam before i had an opiate tolerance.

also since having a high opiate tolerance, weed does nothing but make me feel unpleasantly tired. it doesn't get me high at all.  when I get off opiates properly i'd like to try weed to see what it's ""really"" like."
3080,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,I’m the opposite I only feel the benzos if I do that
3081,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,Be extremely careful mixing these two. Its so easy to go over the edge with benzos in your system. Especially if youre doing dope and not just pills.
3082,why do i barely feel the benzos when im mixing with opiates?,id say because an opiate high is stronger
3083,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,Yes. It will def help. But the hard part will be when u aee totally clean
3084,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,"More times than I can tell you! You just need to take methadone at a dose that makes you feel normal for 3 to 5 days. Same dose each day.

You may need a low dose of klonopin to help you sleep -- less than .05 mgs.

That's it."
3085,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,"Yes, it worked like a boss. Best part about methadone is that you will still usually feel ok the next day as well. Space out out your doses as much as you can. A higher dose is good initially...lower it the second or third day."
3086,Has anyone used methadone for around a week to get off heroin successfully and how?,Would this method work as good with subs as methadone?
3087,What’s a high off Tramadol like?,People either love tram or hate it. You either convert it good or bad. Don’t exceed 200mg because that’s when it starts lowering your seizure threshold. Start with 100

3090,So are different brand oxy 30s different in anyway? Like m30s compared to a215 or k9s . Legally it should all be the same strength but I feel like I have favorites (k9s) is this in my head and it’s the same stuff or is there some info behind this?

Legally it should all be the same strength but I feel like I have favorites (k9s) is this in my head and it’s the same stuff or is there some info behind this? But what are your favorite ?,FDA regulation says for any medicine it can have +- 10% of the advertised dose so some brands might have more or less but it’s pretty negligible. Usually the size of the pill is what matters most to people because they don’t want to snort a bunch of powder like in the RP30s

3101,The fuck? This is medicine and they decided to close shop early? How early/what time did you get there?,"Yeah. It’s a new chemist (drug store) closer to my home. As I was going into town each day for my dose. But that was a mission so my rehab found a closer place to my house. 

I started going there on Friday. The staff said they are open until 7pm every day. Then yesterday the manager said they’ll be closing Monday so she’ll give me my dose. She said she was also thinking of closing early Sunday as Monday is public holiday here and she’ll give me a take home for then. 

But I arrived and apparently they went home around 6pm. Shop next to them said so. I dose late in the day. So this has left me in the shit. Lucky a home call dr wrote me a small one off script for tramadol to last the next 2 days. But this means I’ve relapsed. I would’ve been ok if she called and told me to come in.

Ah I was super sick by 8pm our time which was over 24hrs since my sub dose. I got a home doctor visit and he gave me a prescription for a small amount to just lesson the withdrawals over two days. Tomorrow is the public holiday so I’d be going a couple days from my withdrawals. 

I’ve only been on suboxone for 1 month so having to use tramadol isn’t too depressing. If I had been on the program for a while I would’ve been pretty upset taking them.

It sounds like you did everything possible in your power to avoid a situation like this. Unfortunately things outside your control will always happen. While the tramadol may in fact be your substance of choice, you aren't necessarily using it in an abusive manner, or as some would say in true relapse fashion lol. You are simply taking it to prevent withdrawal, just like your Suboxone. Although your rehab may definitely see this as a technical infraction, with full transparency of everything you have described to us, I believe your rehab will understand and not make too big a deal of it. If they do, in your heart you know you didn't relapse. Keep up the good work and props for not using this as a reason to say fuck it and burn it down. ✌️"

But they cannot subscribe anything. Just advice or help with WD symptoms) who said try and see if a doctor can help out for the two days because I’ve been following all the right steps and no need to put myself through WDs if it’s 2 days. Just to not go overboard and I need to make sure I speak with the chemist to make sure this doesn’t happen again just so I don’t have the needless stress of a dumb situation. 

Thanks for the kind words tho mate. Cheered me up"
3106,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,"No. You'll be fine. 

As long as there is a bit of sub in your system still, you will not be at risk for precipitated withdrawal 

Also, tramadol is atypical in its opi effects, and can be taken concurrently with subs"
3107,On suboxone. Long weekend and chemist is closed. If I take tramadol for two days do I need to purge again to not get precipitated withdrawal?,yes. you can dose your sub as you normally would. two days isn’t a long enough time period for all of the bupe to be removed from your receptors. as long as there is bupe still in your system you’ll avoid any pwds that could possibly occurre otherwise. unless you’re a freak of nature.

3128,I finally got my hands on some kratom after day 3 of WD. I also have some zanaflex. Should I mix them?,If you’re on the third day a 4-5 gram dose of kratom should be plenty.  Inbox me if you have any other questions.
3129,I finally got my hands on some kratom after day 3 of WD. I also have some zanaflex. Should I mix them?,"2mg zanaflex tablets are rather large for such a small amount of active compound, so snorting tablets doesn't seem like an efficient method of delivery. Although a nasal spray is in trials and does have higher bioavailability due to the bypass of first pass metabolism, it requires pH buffers and absorption enhancers. But back to your question, I'm assuming that you chose a red strain of Keaton as your intended use is to control WDs. Zanaflex however administered, will likely add to the sedative effects of a red vein kratom but not much else. I have not tried this combination, but I have mixed kratom with baclofen, benzos and phenibut, and found them to compliment each other nicely. For me, 7g kratom with 1mg Klonopin hits the sweet spot. If your goal is simply to potentiate the effects of your kratom, you should first consider mixing it with grapefruit juice adding about a tablespoon of turmeric and a large pinch of black pepper. Ginger is also an effective enhancer and will help within a nausea you may experience from the kratom. These are much cheaper and more available options then the zanaflex you're attempting to use. If you insist on trying your zanaflex and kratom combination, I would at least add the ginger turmeric and black pepper mixture to control the stomach pain you will inevitably experience. Best of luck"

To know if u have fent u need to either test it with some testing strips or go by how it feels. But if it's got brown spots, usually means it's at least got SOME real dope in it... otherwise just sounds like just some shotty cut then as real dope can range from off white to dark brown/black and everything in between. Is it bitter when u taste it? Does it have a vinegar or acetone smell at all? Those are good things to have in ur dope. If it has no smell or tastes sweet then u prob have fent but again cuts can be deceiving and some shitty dealers try and make their product look like real dope when it's just some random brown cut, fent analogue and white vinegar sprayed on top.

3330,How many days can you take subs with out feeling wds from them when you stop?,I don’t understand your question if your an active addict and you switch to subs you will withdrawal if you stop taking them just as you would on heroin. If you aren’t a junkie there’s really no reason to take subs more than once in a while for a high that just makes you want regular opiates anyway. But if you’ve already been taking them anywhere from a few days to a week +  of taking them everyday will you begin to feel withdrawal. The thing about it is it’s hard to gauge if your withdrawing from something if your not already knee deep in an addiction. I didn’t think I had any withdrawals at all the first few months of doing tons of perks everyday most days it was almost a year before I could recognize I was in clear cut withdrawal. Times before that I’d feel funky or lethargic but I wouldn’t attribute it to withdrawal but looking back i know now it was the beginning  of wds

3347,Tips for hiding it when you’re high?,In my experience you just have to learn how to ignore the hard feelings from those close to you. If we were talking about strangers maybe it would be easier to hide but with people close to you it can be almost impossible. Just my 2 cents.
3348,Tips for hiding it when you’re high?,"if you make it a decade or 2 of using, you won't have to worry bout hiding it because the dope barely does anything after years n years.

And at least ur mom doesn't know to just look at ur pupil size. Once she figures out that trick hiding it is all over.",It truly does just become what most people consider feeling normal. When I got clean for 4 months after using for like 10 years straight my friends and family didn't even recognize my voice over the phone because I had had the opiate voice box every single day for a decade.

3351,"Ohh man, mine will be like “show me your pupils!!” as well. Also, my arms are a dead giveaway, but I can’t bring myself to snorting full time",Yup. But at least eventually if you keep with it long enough youll have so many tracks that you can just blame it as old marks. Give it a decade or two and new pokes will just blend right in
3352,Tips for hiding it when you’re high?,My voice is a dead giveaway. Anyone who knows me well at all like my family or girlfriend know instantly because of how much deeper my voice gets. And I am super monotone when high.

Have you looked into Kratom at all though? It worked really well for me for my adhd and social anxiety, its cheap, u cant OD, u dont have to wait on any dealers etc, and more importantly it wont take your soul. The key is LOW doses. .5-2.5G honestly improved my life and gave me lots of energy. It does keep the door open though as far as opioids in your brain.   It also works AMAZING for WD, like a complete gamechanger."

1) id need to start w 7gram doses 3x per day and taper down 1 gram per dose per week likely.  Kratom powder can sludge up your liver and go tract at that much.  But it’s totally doable and I believe I can be successful there
2) more importantly, the way Kratom binds to and saturates opioid receptors, ibogaine doesn’t have 95% success rate as it does with traditional, whort acting opioids like oxycodone, heroin, morphine.  I’m 100% committed to my I Ogaden plan, pre and post treatment for coaching, integration and long term abstinence.  I plan to implement Victoria after ibogaine sets me free and repairs the opioid receptors and the brain damage I’ve caused to my natural serotonin firings.  

So that being said i can go on Kratom, large doses, and likely still have to deal with a min level of wd, and then switch back to oxy 2-3 weeks before ibogaine treatment and healing

Or

I can just taper my current supply of oxy blues, change from snorting to oral, get down to 45-60 mg per day “coasting dose” then kick and heal completely with ibogaine.  

Or yet so the same above but after I taper to 45-60 jump on kadian for a few weeks until ibogaine.  Leaning toward this option.  

I have to remain fully functional and top of my game the next 3 months to get my businesses crushing before I leave for Mexico for 3 weeks:  I’m willing to put in the work.  I just know myself by now and what will likely works best is the taper/kadian/ibogaine.

Anyone have success or experience with these options?’

Thanks again"

3372,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"Jesus where do I start. I spent more time *in* withdrawal than I did high for a really long time and worked out a system that wouldn't make the WD's go away but make them tolerable.

Tools:
* Loperamide
* Trazodone
* Klonopin or any benzo
* Food (sweets are good)
* Drinks
* Nicotine (important)

So Loperamide by itself will help with WDs immensely if you take enough. No, it will **not** cause your heart to flip upside down and start to die. Not in the amounts I take. I take 20, 2mg pills and wait 2 hours then take 10 more if I need it. It takes 2 hours to work so wait it out.

Trazodone is pretty decent at getting you to sleep if you're taking lope too. By itself, it will put you to sleep if your WDs are mild, but if in full blown Opana or Heroin wd, traz wont be enough.

Klonopin/Benzos are a godsend. Basically, life is worth living again with benzos alone but mixed with lope, its a sure thing.

Food/Drink and Nicotine - Basically, after you eat a lot of food you tend to get sleepy and when in WD, sleep is hard to come by. If I'm allowed to sleep whenever I want throughout the day (like on the weekend) the second I feel remotely sleepy, I go to bed. 

I can increase the success rate for this by timing my eating and drinking along with any form of nicotine. So say, I'll force down some ice cream or pasta or any heavy carb meal and then when I start to get that sedated feeling 30-40 mins after eating, I'll smoke or vape heavily and within 5 or 10 mins I'm ready to try to sleep.

Even with benzos I've been in withdrawal so bad that I still can't sleep and aren't willing to take 3-5mg of xanax with no tolerance just to try to sleep. That always scared me.

I don't always have benzos but usually have trazodone and lope and between them and some well timed meals and some ahem, *personal* time, I can usually squeeze out a couple hours sleep  throughout the day if I'm lucky.

If I take much larger doses of lope like 30+ 2mg pills at a time my success rate goes way up but that much lope feels dirty af.

I know this is sort of a shoddy process with a lot of goofy combos. You don't need trazodone if you have benzos for instance."
3373,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"It will help, but if you are on heroin or oxy, what you need is a few days worth  -- 3 to 5 days -- of methadone at a dose that makes you feel normal.  You can bypass or at least seriously reduce acute withdrawal symptoms that way."
3374,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,Help
3375,Your methods for easing withdrawals?,"Benzos are what gets me though. I couldn’t have switched from methadone to Suboxone without them.

Magnesium and other supplements are good. Magnesium helps with muscle aches and cramps. Eating well, drinking lots of water. If you’ve got diarrhoea or vomiting, or you’re not eating much at all, Gatorade/electrolyte drinks help.

Try to keep yourself busy, even if it’s just having something good to binge on Netflix. Have everything done so you don’t need to worry about shopping, washing, or errands.

Keeping a diary is good. Score yourself /10 for mood, muscle ache, cramps, vomiting/diarrhoea, anxiety, etc... that way you’ll see that you’re getting better over time. Also keep track of medication, food, and water.

I like guided meditations. I find it’s easier to sleep with them. I’ll link one in.

If you have a spare room, you should use that to detox. I think they say that because you don’t want to associate your bedroom and bed with being sick.

Edit: https://youtu.be/ZAJFk0RQ0J0 search ‘guided mediation and sleep’ in YouTube, it took me awhile to find voices I liked. Goodluck!"

3377,You're the best thank you. I took 10 mg about 10 minutes ago or so already feel much better. I'm on day two of wd and it feels like it will never end,"It’s awful isn’t it. Do you have enough valium to get you through the next few days? I made sure u had a decent stash of valium and Xanax. The worst was I had to go into my clinic each day. I’d feel a bit better as the Suboxone was wearing off, and the underlying methadone took hold, ...but then I’d dose at the clinic and be thrown back into withdrawals. I would have quit if I didn’t need to be on Suboxone to travel.

Here’s the form the doctors use to gauge withdrawal. It’s only physical symptoms though. I felt more in control keeping track, but not everyone would.

3395,Tips on potentiating snorting oxy?,You can’t boost bioavailability of snorting as it bypasses the liver entirely and goes directly into your bloodstream. White grapefruit juice might make the half life longer though as your liver enzymes are impaired by it and will not be able to filter the oxy out of your blood as efficiently as normal. You could also try taking 50 mg of Benadryl (DPH) as it will allow you to nod much easier and reduce a lot of the itchiness oxy comes with.

Just be prepared to start out with non-opiates and physical therapy and gradually (hopefully) working your way up to low-grade opiates etc etc .
And never EVER ask for anything specific, they’ll see directly through that and label you as a drug seeker and terminate everything. 
Also, a pain management referral is what you will eventually want/need in order to get any kind of monthly prescription. And ‘if’ you’re lucky enough to eventually get some kind of script, you will be subjected to drug tests and pill counts to make sure you’re not abusing your script and / or mixing it with other drugs. If you fail one of those you’ll also be booted.

tl;dr or more like too hard to read: sorry, i finally got some bangin coke and boy today so ive been speedballing all night.","Yo I just saw this comment now... I can only sympathize with you fella, best wishes and hope you get a stable rx soon, I myself am fighting for one too for lumbar scoliosis and discopathy, its not as painful as yours but when you work your ass off in a kitchen it aint no joke either..."

hope it works out for you, watching doctors who know nothing of the amount pain you, i, or anyone else in legitimate pain are in or going through just sit there and say ""well i cant prescribe any narcotic medicaiton"" and advise some dumbass ibuprofen with ice/heat..make my blood boil (sorry for that janky ass sentence lol, been up doing speedballs all night and am starting to lack simple grammar)"
3426,Why can't I ever find these doctors?,I want him to kill me
3427,Why can't I ever find these doctors?,"i used to have a few friends with scripts from this guy..as a person...they always said he was nice af...if you came in like a junkie...yea riiiight, he'd treat you like one lol. however, one of the girls had a legit script from him....and BAM, she lost that shit when he got got and she had to go through hell and back to find a doctor who would continue her medications afterwards"
3428,Why can't I ever find these doctors?,"trust me. its one of those u wish u did but if u actually had u wouldnt be any better off. every person i know that had a illegitimate doctor ended up soo much worse off than they would have if they never had a doc. Instead almost every person I knew that had an illegal script was cut off at extremely high doses which is borderline illegal except these doctors don't really care about the law, they only care about money. this is years ago by the way."

3433,thank you for your concern. i’m not going to buy any more after i’ve taken the few pills i have left.,"Ultimately you’ll do what you want regardless of what strangers say online. But please, hear me. 

When I was first dabbling in opioids I really liked the chill, relaxing qualities. I thought to myself, “how could something so soft be as dangerous as I’ve been told.”

I just assumed these people had weak willpower. I had zero concept of physical withdrawals. I wrongfully assumed the decision to use opioids or not was as simple as choosing tea or juice with breakfast. 

I’ve been off for about 40 days now. After 20 years of destructive behavior and habits. I’ve been off before, once i was clean for 13 months, I relapsed. Another time I was clean for three years, I slipped right back in. It’s a lifelong struggle. 

I really do wish I could go back.

Edit: clarified."

3449,Just a writer trying to make a character more real! Mind if I ask some questions?,"I have never used heroin, but there are some things I could tell you about opium. The smell oh, HELL, when smoked I sense it as sweet meat, never had sweet sausages but I'd imagine them to taste like that, and that taste, after a long night of smoking, lingers for the entire day after. The substance itself smells more like weeds, like cut grass almost with the smallest hint of sweet and tastes extremely bitter. A problem I often have is opium fingers, yeah, like cheeto fingers but way more expensive, opium is usually very brittle so cutting pieces off produce a lot of crumbs, the other presentation is like a sticky gum, similar to hashish if you have handled it, either way, it's not the easiest thing to work with, so sometimes I endup with opium smelling, sticky fingers.

You’re right when you say that there’s too much context to fully explain it, but I can offer you some hammerin’! 

He’s a heroin addict because the opportunity to be one fell in his lap. Kinda the theory that you can’t sell dope if you don’t know the quality of what you’re selling. As a teenager, he experimented with anything you could possibly ever smoke and heroin was his favorite. My character really likes downers in general, but as he got older and started using more and more, the addiction got more serious. He started to shoot up instead of smoking. Feeling like he would be into downers and given the era this is all based on, heroin/opium seemed like the right fit to be his drug of choice. 

It’s not to glorify drug use, that I can assure you. I’m not trying to make this sexy or appealing, and I’m definitely trying to make it as accurate as I can."

A victorian Heroin user would not have been using a spoon to cook up, they would have been using their mail order syringe kit to inject the gear.

And back then Heroin use was not very common.  It was a novel drug - Morphine was the big ""epidemic"" at the time.  I'd consider making your character a Morphine addict, but I guess it doesn't have the same ""Shock"" value as H does.

Opium in the victorian era was legally available and I'd say the vast majority of opiate addicts used plain Opium.

Read Thomas de Quincey's book - he would buy opium at his local pharmacy (he'd walk in and the pharmacist would give him ""the usual"")  and he would take it orally.  Later he got hooked on laudanum (opium tincture).

Also, if your main character doesn't have access to a steady supply, if he has any kind of habit, the book will just be about your main character hustling to try to get dope."

3472,What causes withdrawal symptoms to change over time?,"My w/d's change depending on what I'm kicking. Oxy, opana, heroin, fent all have very different symptoms. I mean they all consist of the same basic symptoms but they hit at different times if that makes sense. Like opana and fent would have me in near panic attack mode due to my anxiety in under 12 hours where that hits in about 36 hours with heroin. My stomach would be fucked up around 18 to 24 off oxy and can normally make it 48 til its really bad off heroin. Also it varies depending on if I'm shooting or snorting or smoking and how long I have been using for this time and how much I'm using daily. So many variables."

3483,how strong is oxy compared to hydros?,"1.5:1  exactly  , even with oral  bioavailability  taken into  account  thats an accurate  ratio.
So 30 mg of hydro = 20mg of oxy 
But its a different type  opioid   as its main alkaloid  is different  its far less sedating  and a lot more euphoric.  Id say start with 10-15 mg of oxy and add 5 mg every 45 mins till you reach  desired  result. Be careful  with it but oxy is still a relatively  weak opiod.
Just be carefully  of pressed  pills oxy is the most counterfeited pill out there so always  test ur oxy for fentanyl  if its not from the pharmacy, even if you trust your source, ur fuckin up already because **rule #1 is trust nobody** they may not even know  themselves. Anyways be safe  and enjoy oxy is probably  the most fun enjoyable opiate out there.

It would be a great contribution to the world. I've had just about enough of this ""war on drugs"". Opiates are technically some of the safest drugs there are. As long as you don't mix them with obscene amounts of other downers with little to no tolerance, they really are pretty benign. They cause no permanent brain or organ damage and the side effects are pretty minimal.  Society is ignorant and uneducated about any of it, they just blatantly believe what they're told. Not everyone can remain ""clean"" and when you think about how drugs like alcohol are legal, why should they? Alcohol is the worst drug there is, in my opinion. It damages the brain, your organs, leads to domestic violence and traffic accidents, yet it's celebrated like it's something great.   


People should have the right to wake up and take whatever helps them get through their day without blowing their brains or some one else's out. The fact that America incarcerates potheads and opiate addicts, while letting bars flourish everywhere, where drunks can get completely retarded and then drive home and kill another innocent family just boils my blood!  Getting a little off topic here, but I feel it's all relevant and it's an area I'm very passionate about. I wish I wasn't just another ordinary citizen and had some power to get things changed. What happened to our right of ""pursuit of happiness""? If my happiness comes from diacetylmorphine, shouldn't I have that right to pursue it!?

First handful of times he gave me his wallet or all his Suboxone as collateral and he would come back every time, albeit super late/delayed, and hit me with that dog food.  After a while, I stopped taking collateral as he came back every time.

One night then he hit me up for $40 to go cop some fire from the capital (nearby-ish big-ish city with good dope).  Since I’d done so much business with him and he always came back, and I was giving him $60-100/day in business so the $40 seemed like a drop in the bucket that he’d never be stupid enough to rip me off for considering the scale of our business together.

Lesson learned: never underestimate the bounds of people’s stupidity."

Welcome to the wild, woolly, and sometimes maybe even warm world of physically dependent heroin addicts. 

Personally I have Ph-fucking-Ds from the junkie equivalent of MIT in rationalization, cognitive dissonance, avoidance, and denial. In other words if my only perceived route to getting well was to get over on you, I’d do it. I wouldn’t be proud of myself or enjoy doing it and I’d always feel guilty afterwards. I knew it was poor business sense if I was trying to middle for people or whatever: But if that’s what it took to be okay, part of me did what I did while part of me insisted I’m still not that guy deep down right? 

So if I did what your dude did and I came up a few days later or whatever I’d seek to make it right too. Exactly as he did, come on really earnest and desperate to make it right. 

I know people make a big deal of their reputations and that they’d never steal or whatever. That’s cool if you’re able to “manage a habit” or you’re on the dealer side of things where trust often matters quite a bit. Frankly when heroin started to cost me everything that made me human (ironically I did it because it made me feel human) I put aside what other people who did heroin thought of me. It wasn’t a disorder or a bad learned behavior or a disease to me, it was a moral failure and a sin. A product of my inability to look the world in the eye. I assumed everyone else was on their trip like mine, which was so far from reality I can’t believe I was so naive. But since I thought that every other heroin user was a spineless tortured oversensitive quasi-suicidal loser like me, I could easily dismiss whatever your opinion became of me. 

“Thief”? Big deal - you were stealing your family’s peace of mind and a parent from your kid and a partner from your spouse and a decent person from society. You were all part of the problem and you loved it. Why should I care about what you thought of me, as long as it didn’t interfere with my other connects?

But if things lined up where I could “do the right thing” and salvage a drug acquaintanceship, sure I’d do it."
3622,Dude who beat me for $40 paid me back...with interest...the fuck?,This actually happened to me once too. Gave dude some money to run to brick city as we usually did when he was close to re-upping. Then he never showed up. A week later he calls me..I’m apprehensive but meet him. Turns out he burned the plug and got the shit best out of him. Huge black eye and everything. But i guess he felt bad about ripping me off cause he atleast made sure I got what he owed me.

But i guess he felt bad about ripping me off cause he atleast made sure I got what he owed me.,"This is admittedly the first time this has happened to me, normally when a middle rips me they never talk to me again.  It is an interesting subject, though, because when you think about it, who is responsible when the middle gets ripped or fucked up?  Middles always justify charging me more or taking part of the order by saying that they are taking all the risk.  I’m fine paying middles (or providing them part of the order) accordingly.  However, if I’m paying a middle to assume the risk, they should assume the risk of robbery and loss and therefore, if they take a front, pay it back if they don’t deliver my product.

Of course, that is the logical business reasoning behind the distribution of risk and responsibility.  As most middles are junkies themselves, they are often far removed from any sort of logic or reasoning."

Apparently he’s still recovering from whatever loss he took (or whatever reason he robbed me).  That is kind of what I found most impressive, though.  He met up with me at first today and had two bags to give me so I took that and didn’t buy anything additional.  As he made more sales throughout the day, though, he ended up calling me back and meeting up with me another two times; once to give me another one bag and the last time to give me another three as he’d been able to earn back the other bags through additional sales today."

When I was a full blown junkie, of course I did things I’m not proud of.  I robbed tons of stores, stole cash here and there from various outlets/channels, but as I was a junkie myself and knew how much being sick sucked and how hard it was to get the cash I needed everyday, I never fucked over fellow junkies as I would never want to put another person in that situation.  I only stole from people and/or stores that I knew could afford it.

Oddly, during my junkie days, I was the most cautious I ever was when it came to people.  I was dealing with other junkies, dope dealers, and the general scum of the Earth.  If I didn’t like someone or had a bad feeling about someone, I’d steer clear of them, even if they offered to get me well, as I was worried about how they might try to leverage my situation, corrupt me, or take advantage of me."

I live in a VERY small town in BFE right now and there is one plug in the whole town who supplies the four or five street level dealers.  The four or five street level dealers sell half and quarter points for $10, but stepped on to all hell (first time I copped here was their shit, I was like 50+ days sober at the time I believe, I did a half gram and still wasn’t high, just not sick and sluggish).

We are somewhat close to the capital, though, where they have fire ECP stamps (ECP stamps that actually taste and smell like dog food).  In said capital, you can get buns for $30-40 as I understand it.  The main plug that provides to the street level guys goes to the capital, cops a few bricks, and brings it back and distributes to the street dudes for them to chop up and sell as they please.

My middle is said big plug’s cousin or brother or some shit.  He’s a junkie, but he is also the one with the actual connect in the capital.  As a result, he gets a free ride to the capital with the main plug and the main plug tosses him a bit each trip.

After each trip, my middle comes back with a few $30-40 buns (a little cheaper as he gets some tossed on for free) and then sells them to me uncut for $10/bag, but doesn’t cut them at all.  I get fire that I can actually get high off of as well as quasi-decent prices (especially for around here at least) and he makes a few shekels off of each bun and gets some bags to blast himself for free.

It’s a perfectly symbiotic relationship except when he decides to fuck me over even when I’m kind enough to front his ass."

3655,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"Yeah I always had to do morphine or H after coke or crack. I can’t stand the anxiety associated with the come down. I just wanna nod off and go to bed. Albeit I was never super fond of uppers in general, so it wasn’t a common thing for me. But i’ll never say no to drugs so.."
3656,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"Yes, this is extremely common.  A lot of wealthy professionals like tech and finance folks who get coked out or blast Adderall to work longer and make more often develop Opiate or Benzo addictions in an attempt to find a consistent come down."
3657,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"If I smoke rock without opiates/benzos/both then I’m in for a miserable borderline suicidal night.

If nothing else, clonidine works well and also high dose l-theanine (sublingual) is surprisingly effective at bringing my heart rate down and easing restlessness"

I would literally lay out 2 equal lines of each, them mix them into one big line, a sniff the whole thing lmao... I would then smoke crack a lil later. Damn I remember how amazing it all was. I'm basically clean now, no dope but the occasional oxy once every couple months."
3659,Dope after doing coke...thoughts ?,"This is a requirement lmao. Although, since I’m a total fiend, requirement means “nice, but if I can’t make it happen still gonna get high and hate my life coming down without black lol.”"

There are also supermetabolizers who can convert much more, leading to a potential overdose.  OP should proceed with caution and let others know what he/she is doing, just in case."

when i first tried i had a 600mg like 15mg/5ml bottle of codeine linctus and went through atleast 2/3 of it an a night and just by yhe end felt tired, sweaty and a lil sick.

3674,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,Lol I used to overdraft my chase  account 800 bucks every 2 weeks
3675,Lol I used to overdraft my chase  account 800 bucks every 2 weeks,How would I go about getting just $40 out then?
3676,How would I go about getting just $40 out then?,"Set up debit card coverage. If you have a consistent paycheck theyll let you overdraw about as much as you get in direct deposit in my experience. Its a shitty trap though be warned as i was doing the same exact thing with the same bank youre using and you get caught in this cycle of ""ooh i got paid today! Fuck $400 of it went to overdraft fees"" then you get to the point of ""fuck i aint got enough money to take care of my financial obligations after those overdraft fees were taken out, guess i gotta overdraft it again"" then you are getting to the point where maybe one of your checks isnt as good as usual and it doesnt even let you break even on your account balance, thats where youre trapped because youll just be thinking ""idgaf if i overdraft my account i worked for this damn money and i cant last til my next payday on whatever paltry amount i have now"" trust me man think long and hard about this one because its a killer."
3677,How would I go about getting just $40 out then?,You have a second bank account?
3678,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"There isn’t really a *how* to it. You either can or you can’t. It could depend on the account you have. If you have a free checking acct., or if you have, like, a “plus” checking acct., or any acct. that offers benefits over a standard account. There’s usually a few different types the banks offer when you open your account. Mine, for example, has no overdraft fees and offers up to 1,500 cash advance. If you’re not eligible for a cash advance, the ATM will probably not let you withdrawal money you don’t have in there. You can try getting cash back, but again, depending on what your specific account allows, the transaction can still be denied due to insufficient funds. Good luck. 

An alternative, try requesting in r/borrow

If you’re not familiar with the sub: people request X amount of money, with a promise to pay back X amount plus an interest-like tip, on X date.
(i.e. requesting $40, will pay back $50 on 10/04/19)"

3680,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"If you have overdraft protection you can just buy something at a grocery store or Walmart and get cash back. There’s obvi a fee, but I’ve done it when I’m desperate."
3681,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,[deleted]
3682,[deleted],I tried to do it online in chase’ settings and it said I had no “eligible” overdraft accounts unfortunately.
3683,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,"You can deposit a check at an atm with chase and receive up to $100 or $200 of that deposit immediately.  I would write a check from an old account sometimes when I was desperate and deposit it, take the money out immediately from the atm and it would be a full two days before they realized the check bounced.  By the time the check bounced, my direct deposit would hit to cover the overdraft.  Chase didn't care for this type of behavior one bit and cancelled my account the 2nd time I did it."
3684,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,Overdrafting ability is not specific to the bank you use it’s specific to the way your account was set up. When you opened it you either selected or it was pre-selected based on the product whether to allow the bank to process transactions that will result in an overdraft. Often times people will say no bc they don’t want to incur the fees associated if it happens via error or even to prevent it happening with fraud. If you have bad credit the checking product may have it disabled given they aren’t confident you would be able to repay the amount plus fees if they did process it. Unless you have an additional product called an overdraft line of credit then you will not be able to overdraft at an ATM for sure and most likely nowhere unless it runs just the preauthorization amount first before true amount like someone was mentioning with gas stations above. If it is rejecting it then that is a factor of product and account set up. Call the bank and ask for overdraft protection (also called overdraft line of credit some places) if you want to be able to overdraft in the future but realize your credit score will impact if they allow you to have this product.
3685,How Can I Overdraw Chase Account?,This is what fucked my credit up. I would just take a cash advance out on my credit cards and if end up never paying it back and before I knew it my cards were maxed

3711,Why does heroin give me so much energy?,"Very high quality tar gave me energy too when I was using. In all but super high doses. I had undiagnosed sleep issues though so that may have been part of it.

#3 to a small extent, and tar and opium to a greater extent, tend to have other non diacetylmorphine opiates present with some varying degrees of euphoria to respiratory depression to sedation to stimulation ratios. Tar in particular has high levels of 6-monoacetylmorphine which is the god-king of opiates as far as euphoria to other effects goes giving a stimulating effect. Appreciable in top tier tar no doubt.

Some people just react differently to opiates though. I got energy and euphoria and rarely nodded nor even enjoyed nodding. Others get the sedation and love that going as far as preferring fent and analogues with their low euphoria to respiratory depression and sedation ratios.

I'd say you are a lucky one in your reaction."

3722,Good way to dose fentanyl?,"Volumetric... Mix it with a certain amount of water, it will mix evenly in water, then you can measure out exact dosages, just make sure your math is right, ask on here if you need a double check."

Mix it with a certain amount of water, it will mix evenly in water, then you can measure out exact dosages, just make sure your math is right, ask on here if you need a double check.",This seems to be the safest method to accurately measure your dose. I've heard of people making this solution stronger and then putting it in a nasal spray bottle for ease of use and dose control.
3724,Good way to dose fentanyl?,32mg of sub a day? Jesus. I used to sprinkle fent on weed or tobacco and take very small hits. Id usually nod off and pass out after only a couple small puffs. Be very fucking careful.

CAUTION: Be careful about taking too many of those hydros, each one has 500mg of Acetaminophen. More than 4000/day is very bad for your liver, and you really shouldn't take more than 1000mg in a single sitting either. Hopefully you're not snorting these - Acetaminophen is not meant to be snorted.

3769,"Oxycodone and NDRI, any interaction?",One will cancel out the other if the doses aren’t correct. What you’re doing is called a spotted ball. Be careful because the duration of the drugs are different so if you do too much of one it might kill you if you’re not habituated to it at higher doses. Just know that they’ll potentiate each other but at your dose it should be fine to mix Ritalin and Oxy. A friend of mine used to take Adderall and Oxy all the time and said it was one of the greatest pleasures ever. Long story short he has a really hard dependency to kick

3773,How long does Opiate withdrawal typically last?,"Which one is worse, heroin WD or oxy WD?"
3774,"Which one is worse, heroin WD or oxy WD?",Heroin.
3775,Heroin.,Why?
3776,Why?,I have no idea. I'm not a scientist.
3777,I have no idea. I'm not a scientist.,I meant why as in more intense? Longer? What’s worse about it not the scientific explanation
3778,I meant why as in more intense? Longer? What’s worse about it not the scientific explanation,All of it. Why do you want to know?
3779,"Which one is worse, heroin WD or oxy WD?","Generally, assuming equivalent relative use between opiates, the longer the half life the worse the withdrawals. Short half life opiates will have somewhat more intense withdrawals in comparison, but last far less time. 

Heroin depends a lot on the actual product you have. Pure diacetylmorphine will have a moderate withdraw period and intensity, while diacetylmorphine cut with just fentanyl (mind you, more analogues change this) will have an intense period of withdrawal early thanks to the fent, and continue into to moderate duration and intensity via the diacetylmorphine.

Something like methadone and bupe have long enough half life's to push withdrawals into the weeks to month+ range. That's just straight up acute withdrawal, not even talking post acute withdrawal depression."

When people get into dope, whether it be that they cant affford both (and dope wins), or whatever the reason, if you dont smoke more than twice a week its not gonna be the mollow ""stoned"" you remember, but an anxiety filled ride almost like a bad trip.

I have noticed a lot of users quit when they FIRST get addicted. I did. I said the same as you -- weed was anxiogenic and I wanted to relax.

Well, as I got older and my addiction went on weed actually started to relieve the stress if my addiction to heroin. It became a great comfort during withdrawal, it allowed me to see my situation from the Birds eye view, and guess what??? From that perspective, a little dope sickness really AINT SHIT. And I can actually enjoy some goddamned music. Now, a lot of dope sickness (ie wd from a really big habit) really is shit, but it STILL isn't THAT bad, and it's still mostly just a bad flu if you keep the proper mentality (and a couple of subs, 10 Valium, and 20 400 mg gabapentin, along with the aforementioned cannabis doesn't hurt either).

Anyways... Bottom line, I do smoke herb again although I tend to smoke less during the worst parts of my addiction. Just smoking a little herb after being abstinent from it for a couple weeks tends to rein my use in, which is always a good thing. N

It makes me think twice about my use. In a good way.

Now, if I smoke TOO much, this self analysis can go too far and produce some anxiety or depression. But, that's just taking too much. Taking too much dope makes me, ya know, FUXKING DIE, so I just don't do that, and too much weed makes me anxious, so I just dont do that."

And yes, Lyrica and similar drugs like gabapentin definitely help with cravings. They just also have their own dependence and withdrawal.

An equivalent dosage to 8 mg of subs intranasal (or really any dose above like 4 to 8 sublingual or equivalent in other routes of administration, eg 3 to 6 mg intranasal) would be about 30 mg of methadone. Maybe 40. Subs don't ever really do much more than what 40 mg of methadone does.

Again, increasing your sub dose will not add much if any ""good"" opioid effects. There's a ceiling on it's activity at the mu receptor. Going up will either do nothing or give you a bigger dependence to subs other (sorta weird) effects without making you feel any better."

3851,Same here. I'd compare it to the horrible taste of alcohol that people seem to pretend to enjoy.,"Not at all comparable in taste, or flavor.

3855,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I wanted to add, I'm a low key highly (pun intended) functional addict. I'm addicted because I need the pain control but it also boosts my energy allowing me to be more social and productive. Crazy productive.

Cleaned my house and did all of the laundry. Made phone calls and basic other Mom stuff. All while taking quick breaks to shove dilaudid up my nose. I've been this way for  a very long time, nobody, not even my husband,  knows.

3861,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Anyone who mocks someone for not using any drug is a fucking cunt.   Ideally, we would all walk the earth in complete homeostasis, every chemical in our brains in balance.   That's not the case because we're all damaged in some way, most drug use or abuse is an attempt to right the ship.

If you tested everyone, even the anti-drug crusaders, you'd find a majority of people have one or more of legal, non-prescription drugs like coffee, alcohol, nicotine, THC, psychotropic drugs (Xanax, SSRIs, etc), high levels of refined sugar, etc.

And the ""clean"" ones are on some other trip, like religion, or they're into pedophilia, they beat their wives and children, or they're just plain nasty people.

Do what you have to do to get by and try not to damage yourself or others.  Besides that, there are no rules.  I smoke weed because my system loves it, I might suggest it for someone with certain medical issues."
3862,Anybody else not smoke weed?,I don’t use anymore but for some reason heroin made me hate weed and get super paranoid. I used to smoke all the time before opiates even a good amount when doing blues. But as soon as I stopped doing heroin I started smoking again it felt great.

I had a small type of schizophrenia which eventually went away after lots of weed for the next 1 and a 1/2 years to 2 years after i quit smoking spice. I could continue and go on about all the short and long term effects of spice and how i would advocate against whatever chemical happens to be in that batch because most of the potpourris are worse than even heroin. I found that out when i heard of addicts switching to spice because they weren’t suffering from opiate withdrawals as much as it was spice that was giving them terrible withdrawals.
3870,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Can’t think of any funny stories at the moment. But I was definitely the “square” or the “prude” of my group. I stopped smoking around 16/17 after being a heavy smoker for the last 3-4 years. I mean like a smoke tons of weed every day heavy user. For exactly the same reason as you. It made me extremely paranoid with awful anxiety. 

It was actually the group inside joke to ask me if I want to hit the bong whenever it’d go around. I also gave up drinking relatively young. And shortly after partying and all other drugs that weren’t opiates. And of course no one knew/knows I use(d) opiates. I was the tiny shy quiet naive innocent girl who was hopelessly in love with someone who didn’t love her back. (Jokes on him tho bc after waiting for 4 years we finally got together and are now engaged and together going 7 years strong)

Everyone pretty much thought I just got super serious about school but the truth is a really bad mushroom trip ruined all drugs for me. I’ve never been more scared except for the time my ex best friend OD’ed in my living room. After the bad trip I couldn’t be on anything that left me feeling ‘out of control/not completely in control of myself’.

Opiates specifically oxycodone hit that perfect sweet spot. I could get high and also feel super safe calm and in control of myself. I guess it’s usually the ones who appear the most innocent and put together that are really the ones with the darkest secrets."
3871,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Pot gives me anxiety too. I used to smoke it everyday in high school, then bam, one day I couldn’t stop overthinking everything.  I used to love LSD in high school, but the last trip I had was a bit out there. It wasn’t bad, but I was overthinking again.

I think the majority of us smoke pot. We do it because it gets us away from thinking about shit. I don’t mind small amounts of psychedelics now, but it does make you see things much more clearly. I’d prefer psychedelics over pot any day!"
3872,Anybody else not smoke weed?,I love mainline h but hate smoke pot. It's not for me man.
3873,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"This Happened yesterday with me. I’m pretty introverted but I’m “cool” with everyone at my job, they are a bit younger, it’s wild to think I just turned 30, but my coworkers always smoke and ask me to join them and I just blame it on probation. I’m a pretty anxious person already and weed makes my anxiety and over analyzing everything go to a ten it’s so uncomfortable. This is common in opiate users I’ve come to find out over the years, people that used to smoke mad weed when they started using opiates, they started to hate weed. When you’re clean it’s even worse lol. Maybe it’s a chemical change in the brain or maybe we expect an opiate like high subconsciously and it’s something not even close. Who knows but I’m with you and I’m sure hundreds of people in this sub are too lol."
3874,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"yeah dude I've never really liked weed because of the anxiety it gives me (but it does improve my perception of music a lot, which is one aspect I appreciate). Before I became a daily dope user, I'd maybe do weed once in a while if I were really bored, but once my drug habit became serious, I would spend all my money on heroin and coke. I knew what kind of high I liked, so why sacrifice a bellringer or two just to get some weed? And now that I'm on methadone, I'm not supposed to test positive for thc if I want take-homes. 

Psychedelics were the first drugs I ever did and I really appreciate my experiences on them, but absolutely none of them were 'fun' or totally enjoyable, barring maybe the time I did DMT (took a xanax beforehand, but also it was so intense an experience, I couldn't get caught up in anxious thoughts-- I was too busy just being strapped in for the ride). 

I had a similar experience to you in college. Definitely was assumed to be a teetotaller because I didn't drink or partake in any visible drug use of any kind (although I would have if I knew more people at my college who used harder drugs). There was an arrogance and also an insecurity/anxiety behind it though. Anyway, that was a few years ago. Managed to hide my dope habit throughout 2 years as a data engineer in silicon valley, until I began speedballing, which made me spectacularly implode in a matter of months."
3875,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Used to be me, but now being on benzos, weed is super nice. No anxiety and i know my limits. can always smoke more but cant undo too much if you catch my drift. like a weed OD except it’s not fatal, you just puke for a couple hours and that aint fun"
3876,Anybody else not smoke weed?,Fucking hate smokin pot
3877,Anybody else not smoke weed?,For me the opiate high no matter dose or route of administration always is underwhelming but still nice. However I won't indulge in opiates without weed but I am a heavy cannabis user who could smoke back to back gram blunts of the loudest loud. When combined however opiates are quite a profound high I must admit.

But yeah same. Couldnt smoke it would make me anxious."

Most people who actually know me are like wtf when the find out I don’t smoke cuz I’ll do a shot of meth, heroin and pcp but somebody offers me a joint and I’m like HELL NAH BOI I ain’t tryna die today lmao"

3885,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Weed is such a boring drug. I've tried it around 5-6 times and it just didn't really do anything for me, though I suppose with such high standards as opiates nothing is really comparable. 

I used to be a heavy alcohol drinker too before having touched opiates, and now I can't stand alcohol. Tried a few different psychedelics and MDA and was also not that much of a fan, usually don't care for uppers at all with the only exception being coke, and even then I'm eh. 

Unless it's an opiate, benzo or ketamine I don't really care that much for it."
3886,Anybody else not smoke weed?,Yeah no I’m not a weed person I used to smoke everyday but quit for about 5 years last year I hit like a little one hitter of some medical shit. Let me tell you that I was praying to god not to let me die  the shit they got now it too damn potent I just can’t do it anymore
3887,Anybody else not smoke weed?,I used to shoot heroin before going to class in college.
3888,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Weed's the only way I'm able to eat and keep food down, due to some undiagnosed motility issue. If I don't have any green to calm my nausea and ensure the food moves from my stomach to my bowels, then hours after I eat -- when the stomach should normally already be empty again -- I'll vomit back up _everything_ I'd eaten since the last time I threw up. In the past I've lost up to 30lbs in a few weeks and become grossly dehydrated and malnourished, to the point that my skin was flaking off and my hair was falling out. 
But yeah, in the end I'm just thankful that you guys _have_ and can take the option to not smoke weed. 

Granted, I'm not complaining _too much_ about it being something _I need,_ because I always have enjoyed a nice bowl every now and then, even before I got sick, but it starts to weigh on you when you realise you're no longer just getting high _for fun,_ and it gets expensive needing to smoke any time I eat, and I'm not financially stable enough to really continue this way; I am grateful to be relying on a natural drug as opposed to shit the Pharma shills try to get me hooked on so I'm drawn into their vortex of addiction, dependence and enabling, though. 

Another nice little positive to the whole thing is that it's gotten so much easier to obtain than it used to be (especially for a socially awkward nobody who lives out in the middle of Buttfuck Nowhere, Manitoba, Canada and doesn't know _any_ dealers personally and had to rely on another pothead to contact her dealer for me; she was a toxic, shady as fuck, _dirty ass lying whore of a ""friend""_ and _you know_ she never let me forget or live any of the times when I'd ask her to pick up for me down -- not that she'd ever _let me_ stop using her as a middle-man anyway, since she'd lose her ability to steal money and weed from me at every chance [sorry for the rant, it's a bit of a sore spot >.<]) since Canada rolled out the big okay for recreational marijuana and opened up dispensaries everywhere -- now there's one twenty minutes away where I can talk to super knowledgeable employees about what strains suit me best and I know if I find a good one I can rely on them to still be carrying it next time I'm there; not like when I was buying unreliable ditch weed from friend-of-a-friend dealers, where you have no idea where it's coming from, if you'll ever be able to get it again, the conditions it was grown in, if the dealer likes you enough to sell to you again or even _what strain you were just sold!_"
3889,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"After I started dope, I could not smoke pot.

I know this was not your question, but I felt the need to weigh in."
3895,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Was a pothead throughout my teens, but much like OP and others here, paranoia, anxiety, etc. ruined it for me. 

The one exception I've discovered were some 100% Indica (pretty sure it was Indica, anyways), 10mg gummies that were recommended by a friend of mine that works for a large edibles company in Colorado, and were among the goodies a group of mutual friends brought back after their 4-20 vacation. 

None of the negatives, just a nice, ~6 hour, full body high. The best, and totally unexpected, aspect of the experience was the complete lack of cravings for dope. Would love to stock up on those bad boys."
3896,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I know sooooo many heroin addicts who won’t smoke weed bc it makes them paranoid... like it’s this very common thing. I feel the EXACT same way- will not touch weed, unless it’s shake, I’m alone, in front of a tv, with copious amounts of food. 

The weird thing is a smoked a shit ton of weed til I was 23/24. Then boom, all of a sudden it’s the worst thing ever."
3897,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I would smoke a little when I was using fent but after I quit fent I got addicted to weed and got high literally any time I possibly could. Now my tolerance to weed is so high that I have to quit for a while. I don’t get high from any amount of weed, edibles, dabs, etc I just can’t get high. My vision gets different and I feel it in my body but I just don’t get high at all. For some reason I’ve never had any anxiety or bad highs from weed, so it was really easy to become dependent on it after fent"

3923,"They offered me weed, I declined. I then proceeded to go snort heroin",🤷🏼‍♂️
3924,Anybody else not smoke weed?,Nah people dont freak out if you dont smoke weed. Idk who your circle of friends are but that literally just doesn't happen. Now with heroin I see people all over this thread freaking out if I say something. Ad about it. Y'all all know you are playing a game with life and death every time you shoot up. Maybe your friends freak out you dont smoke weed because you do heavy drugs. Maybe they dont want you to die and they freak out to smoke weed because the chances of dying from a joint is a lot less likely than sticking a needle with some heroin into your veins.
3925,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I don’t smoke weed anymore cuz it makes me freak out and have crazy panic attacks, used to smoke daily though."
3926,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"Same boat exactly  its hilarious  even guys who work  for me laugh at me for not drinking or smoking weed, little do they know about the 90+ mg of dilaudid  30+ mg of temazepam  and whatever other fun things  from plastic  orange bottles i do everyday😂 and they think in staight edge. Fuck id be doin  dope to if real dope was actually  sold around me"
3927,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I used to care about looking and acting like a normie to ""hide"" my use, but as time went on, i realized everyone can eat my ass if they don't like it."
3928,Anybody else not smoke weed?,"I smoke all day, everyday, unless I do meth. To me, meth+weed is the only drug combo I really hate."
3929,Anybody else not smoke weed?,Depends on the strain. Kush (Indica) has mostly low THC and doesn't fuck my shit up. The psychedelic aspect of Haze just always leads to panic attacks/anxiety

Dilaudid - editing my original post!","Dilaudid has terrible oral bioavailability so it’s not a surprise that sniffing or boofing them worked better.

Oxycodone for example has like a 90% oral bioavailability so any ROA would work, but IMO eating is the best option for those  unless you’re trying to circumvent the time release. The differences between IV and oral dilaudid are insaaaaane 😆"

That’s when you know you gotta take it easy. It will be obvious. Although you’ll probably be alright, snorting opioids is relatively easy on the nose compared to more caustic chemicals like meth. 

About the boofing inconsistencies, if it didn’t work the boofer might have done it wrong or they had a giant shit in their pipes blocking absorption or something.

I want to also stress that a minute after snorting, wet your fingers with some water or get a little water cupped in your hand and lean your head back and snort a tiny amount of water. It will help with the drying out of your nostrils and make you feel a little better but it will also help break down any powder stuck to some boogers or whatever since what you’re snorting is water soluble"

That's because they've been on opiates for awhile and they're super sensitized almost. Your pain tolerance goes down after using these things for a while. I have a prescription, I have a serious illness. And when I say serious I mean terminal. And it was hard for me to get them at 1st. That's partially because a lot of people are going in and asking for it when it's not really ""medically necessary"". But I do believe they're telling the truth when they rate their pain. It's unfortunate but it's true, when your tolerance for these things goes up your pain tolerance goes down

3952,Thanks! Would the red or green be best?,Red maeng da. Get that strain. Or any red if you cant find that one.
3953,How much for withdrawals?,7 gram per pill?? Those would be huuuge pills. Or is it extract and equivalent to 7g? My dose is 5g 3 times a day. If i just came off dope it's like 7 grams 4 times a day.
3954,7 gram per pill?? Those would be huuuge pills. Or is it extract and equivalent to 7g? My dose is 5g 3 times a day. If i just came off dope it's like 7 grams 4 times a day.,.7 per pill.

3958,is a low flame better to smoke off foil ?(Heroin#3),Yes. You should vaporize and not burn it.
3959,is a low flame better to smoke off foil ?(Heroin#3),"It's really difficult to describe without seeing. You want it at an angle so when it's heated and liquifies it runs and makes a trail. Its way better to angle it too steep then too flat. If it's angled too steep the worst that can happen is a hit or two are left on the trail and you can just go back over those spots. If it's too flat it's like a frying pan, it just Burns and bubbles and doesn't run. As for the flame I've always preferred a bic lighter, and only touching the foil with the tip of the flame. 

TL:DR - 45° is generally ideal, but it's better to angle it too much than too little"

3986,Green OP 80,"Ok, the OP are the hardest to ""make instant release"".  You could cut this in half and take it and it would still be like taking an extended release pill. The extended release is distributed throughout the pill, it's not just a coating. You'll find that when you go to cut it, it's extremely hard so a pill cutter really is the best way to do it. If I was you I would cut it up into really tiny pieces and parachute it or you can try to chew it up but it's really rubbery. These are the ones that people say to drop in a small glass of Coca-Cola overnight and that breaks the instant release mechanism. With the theory being that it's an acidic solution so it's like sitting in your stomach so the oxy is released. I've done it a few times and it does feel like an instant release pill but I don't know if you wanna weigh 8 hours lol. So your best bet is to chew it up and like I said that would be like taking 40 mg of oxy because that's exactly how much it is"

You don't magically make it more by cutting it up. If you have no tolerance then yeah, I guess making it instant release would be more dangerous. But everybody on here is trying to break that extended release mechanism lol. If you are normally taking instant release pills these are going to feel different. They're not gonna hit as hard or as fast"
3989,You don’t think it’s kinda dangerous to split em tho ?,No
3990,Can you split OxyContin 80?,"Splitting isn’t dangerous.  Dual polymer matrix woven into the shit so the time release is all up in the white shit inside too.  If you want to ER them, you need to chew or dissolve them.  If you cut one in half and then swallow, it will be ER still."

It might be backing it up into your eyes as well. After and before you snort you could irrigate with saline (dont irrigate after until you've already begun to feel the effects).  Honestly even if you're not getting this from your sinuses this is a good idea to do anyway to avoid problems and infections"

4034,How long does the high from an 80mg OxyContin last?,the pill is meant to be extended release for 12’Hours
4035,the pill is meant to be extended release for 12’Hours,In your experience did you feel high for the full 12 hours?
4036,In your experience did you feel high for the full 12 hours?,"If your tolerance is truly low, you're much better off splitting it into 2-4 pieces and taking those a few hours apart.

You're likely to get sick and puke if you pop a whole ER 80 with a really low tolerance.

And to answer your question, I'd say the high lasts around 3-6 hours, but again it depends on your tolerance a lot."
4037,In your experience did you feel high for the full 12 hours?,I don't know much about extended release other than the fact that it releases x amount per hour but in my opinion man if you are not opiate tolerant I most certainly would not be taking the entire 80. If someone with more knowledge than me could enlighten me I would greatly appreciate it but whether it's instant release or extended release if you haven't been doing this s*** for a while I think taking the whole 80 would be a bad idea. At the very least I would imagine that you will be throwing your guts up for 12 hours
4038,the pill is meant to be extended release for 12’Hours,6.6666677mg per hour
4039,How long does the high from an 80mg OxyContin last?,The ERs never last the length they say. For me anyways. I’m lucky to get 3 hours out of them. Usually 2.5.
4040,How long does the high from an 80mg OxyContin last?,"“Feeling high” is a sensation linked to your perception. It’s highly subjective, we can’t really tell you how long YOU will be high. 

But an OxyContin, taken whole as intended has a 12 hour window of affect. Subjectively, I always felt them wear off around the 8-10 hour mark."
4041,How long does the high from an 80mg OxyContin last?,If your tolerance is low DO NOT take the whole pill. Figure out your tolerance and split the pill with a pill splitter accordingly.
4042,How long does the high from an 80mg OxyContin last?,"I wouldn’t take much at all then take 10 mg more each hour, and Id say don’t go over 30/40 mg total. If u don’t have a tolerance I think you’ll feel it"

I took some of the codines today which didn't help my back at all, so the gear is actually helping me, I have one bag left for tomorrow, then I'm out! Just enjoying the respite at the moment from all the pain. But I'm done with that lifestyle, I just can't do it anymore, it's not living...

And well done, bruh! Stay strong and never look back at this shit!","Good man, I really hope you can make it through it, you seem sincere. Are you a pain patient? I guess thats why it was easy for me to finally quit, after 11 years, because I dont live with any chronic illnesses like that. I dated a girl with fibromyalgia. She and I got really bad into pills then dope. She got clean right after we split up, I cant imagine how shes dealing with the pain now. I can tell you that I have never had pain in my body and when I was in active addiction when I was in with drawers it would actually cause me to have very severe lower back pain and funnily enough as soon as I got to wait for good I haven't had any pain issues since Sotomayor opiates definitely make pain worse in the long term. 

I really hope you're able to push through and beat this demon that we all carry if that is what you want. Think of all the money you will save and the relationships you can rebuild and think of the future you have without drugs, that's honestly been my biggest motivation that and the fact and my ex-girlfriend is talking to me again. I'm so in love with this woman she is half of the reason that I'm clean right now and she finally after 3 months of no contact let me back into her life and I'm super happy to say that I'm about to call and her bed and cuddle her while we fall asleep :)

Shoot me a private message if you ever want to chat or someone to listen. Im all ears and available anytime :)"

I'm too old and have done this shit way too many times to count now. It comes a point when you just can't keep putting yourself through the same shit, over and over, you know!? And unfortunately, I'm not a pain patient, no. I got in to this when I was younger through seeing my brother doing it. I started my detox Saturday and my back 'popped', for want of a better word, on Tuesday. Maybe it went before and the gear was masking it, I don't know. And it sounds like you could have had the same happen to you, aha. I've been the same, always illness free when using. No aches, pains, flu etc!

And I have that very same motivation! People on here say not to detox for others, instead do it for yourself. Whereas, I'm doing it for my Mrs that I did it for the last time, also! For me, that's a good enough reason! I nearly lost her to this shit, this time. And I can't lose her... She is everything to me and so much more worth than this devil! Also, now she knows everything, she's really supportive and got me through it with ease the last time. We sat down and talked about shit too, which led us both to buy home drug test kits, to make sure I don't slip up. But as with the original post, the tablets from the Dr's will throw a negative, which is why this last blip is happening. And in my defense, this gear is helping my back right now, so I can do shit until, hopefully, the scan letter comes from the hospital. I'm glad you found another reason to quit, other than yourself! When I see these posts about just doing it for yourself, I always think it's more healthy to have other reasons too! Because they become the gaols that some people can't think about while they're detoxing! And I really hope you get back with her, dude! Stay clean and prove to her everything, that's exactly the chance I've been given and I'm not fucking that up!

Her absense taught me so much about myself, and I absolutely am not willing to throw that away ever again. This is my third and absolute final chance with her. She is super supportive in my recovery, the only way she will leave me is if I start using again, other than that I'm a lovely person (I think, and hopefully she does too ) :) life is good

Also, this may not be much to anyone else, but yesterday at my therapy I peed dirty for only suboxone, no THC!!! I'm super happy about it, and she is shocked I havent been smoking pot, which shes ok with thankfully, but it is a crutch of mine.

Fir the first time in 15 years Im 100% and motivated :) she is the only person I've met who makes me want to be a better person, not forces me to be a better person, and I think thats a very admirable trait in a person, because theirs a strong difference between the 2"

And nice! Keep it that way and keep her! I hope it works out well for you! And damn, we're in the same boat, all except this is my 2nd time going through it with my Mrs. And there's no way I'm throwing it away either. There is not one thing that will stop me from showing her that she means more than a devil drug, or anything else for that matter. And that's the thing with this drug too! Most of the people that use are actually nice people, hearts of gold! I like to think I'm one of them. And the same as you, I like to think that my Mrs can see that in me. And to be fair, mine and yours must see it!! They wouldn't have stuck around else... 

Are your drug tests random, or? I used to smoke a LOT of weed, but haven't smoke it for nearly a decade! I tried to smoke it a few months ago, and fuck...!! Weed has been engineered to be so much more potent than I ever remember... I ended up in the hospital, tripping balls and not breathing properly... needless to say, I won't be touching that again, ahaha! I shouldn't even be smoking gear, as 2 years ago, just before Christmas, I run the lighter too close to the foil and blew half of my lung due to the heat! Apparently, lungs are like pockets of grapes, my left lung now is half grape and half tennis ball. Been told not to go scuba diving as the pressure could pop the tennis ball area and cause my lung to rupture/collapse... I also need to stop the cigarettes too. Been smoking for 22 years now, with a 2 month gap back in 2010 after a mini-stroke I had 🙄

And I love that feeling!! The feeling of being clean which comes with that feeling of actually being awake for the first time in... Fuck knows how long!! Its like you've been emotionally disconnected through all the using. You don't notice at the time, as when you're using, you're just numb to everything and think that's 'normal'... But finally waking up! Fuck, I love that feeling!! Its so much better than the high from H, a thousand times better! Awake, a clear head and the energy to even feel just a little motivated... I want that soooooo bad! That and the thought of my Mrs wanting to stay with me... Nothing could ever ruin that, which is why I know I'm going to be free of this shit very, VERY soon.

And I know that feeling only too well!! My Mrs is the same, she won't try to mould me in to the person she wants to be with, she takes me for me and loves me all the same. Which in turn, just makes me want to be a better person for her, to be the person she deserves! Because all the lies and shit that I've fed her these last few months... She deserves sooo much more than that and so much more. I don't think I'll ever be able to say ""that's enough, I've repaid her to what she deserves"", because she'll always be worth more than anyone could give! And you're right! Theres a very big difference! 

Also, I know my Mrs. Loves me, even through all the shit I've put her through. Our first date... I met her on PlentyOfFish(don't know if you have that over there, it's a dating site). We talked on the phone and Skype for a few months. I finally took the dive and drove for an hour and a half to meet her. Our first date consisted of us just chatting shit in her living room, getting a dominoes pizza, 2 beers each... Then we fell asleep on her sofa while having a cuddle and still chatting shit! ahaha!! 😂 in my eyes, it's the best date I've ever been on or heard of, lol. And that date was nearly 5 years ago now!

Hell, I go to the dentist for a root canal and they offer me twelve of them if I’m hurting afterwards, I usually decline them though because I’m off opiates now. There has definitely been a push to keep teens and young adults from any opiates because that’s your primary age where people get turned on to opiates and eventually addicted, it is less likely for people to become addicted as they age. In addition, it’s also more likely for people to age out of addiction if they survive that long. It’s not a rule or anything though."

At least, that's what it was like for me.",I wish when I was using people would put me down and not encourage my bad behaviors. For the longest I was functioning getting great grades and everything was working out. People would not relate my drug addiction as a problem because it wasn't affecting my every day life. I wish I had someone to say you are a fucking dumbass for continuing to do this shit. I ultimately had to tell myself this because that's ultimately the only person who cared enough. I was selling just about anything so I could buy my drugs and this alone is bad. I was buying praz from black web and pressing xans. One day I ate about 100 xans and blacked out for a few days. Than my dealer offered me a huge bag of fent to press blues. That was the day I decided to quit because I realized how many people would be dying from that shit. It's no way to properly make a blue with fent in your house but people do it anyways. And everyone in this thread knows that and continue to put their life at risk. Anyone who dies from this shit I feel for I really do because I know it isn't easy to quit. But they know the possibilities of buying fake pills that are pressed. They also know they dont wanna feel dope sick when they cant get their clean pills so they'll be okay buying a fake one because hey maybe it will work and you won't die  but I'd rather not take the risk as it seems stupid. If you need drugs to not feel bad about yourself you are caught in a terrible circle. Once you clean up it takes awhile to even start feeling normal again. That's even after the sickness pass. I just hope everyone in this thread will quit one day before it's too late. I think opening people's eyes to scary truths instead of sugarcoating it because I dont wanna hurt their feels is a better method to get someone to quit and live a healthier life.

Coke to me isn’t much of a stimulant in the way that amphetamines are, but more of a euphoriant. In my experience with high purity cocaine, a true coke high is oddly chill and feels very mentally uplifting and talkative. In a sense it’s like an opioid without the sedation or analgesia, but the euphoria and ego boost are still present. 

On the other hand and in my experience, amphetamines are less euphoric than coke (with the exception of MDMA) but they are much more true to the word “stimulant”‘ than yayo is. I get a more adrenaliney, productive high from amphetamines, one that makes mundane tasks much more enjoyable to do, compared to how when I’m on coke all I want to do is focus on the euphoria. 

A way I describe their differences to my less experienced friends is that the amphetamine class of drugs makes doing things feel good, and cocaine makes you feel good to be doing nothing. Unless I am socializing or doing something else that I already find enjoyable, other things can feel as if they are distracting me from honing in on my coke buzz."

I've done 30mg no tolerance before and it was cool but did 40mg the next day and was disappointed (years ago). I've also done 50mg hydrocodone no tolerance before and was fine although I did overdose on 60mg from chugging the CWE too fast. I've never got sick from opiates before even tho I'm not bothering with CWE this time. The tylenol is what contributes to the nausea a lot doesn't it? Maybe I'll take just 25mg, gonna wait a couple more hours and eat before I do because I still haven't ate anything. Also everytime I redose opiates it's a complete waste and I don't feel anything. Will let you know how it went in a few hours"

But just remember you can always take more but never less. I think if you ate all the 30, you’ll feel amazing regardless of if there’s nausea. Just lmk how it goes, I’m curious. 🍕"

4325,Imo you are defying the laws of physics by not getting sick. I mean more power to ya 🤙,No but I forget about the itching... the unbearable constant itching.... it almost takes away from being able to enjoy it because I can't stop itching all over. all opiates make me itch bad. I prefer benzos. For some reason I dont itch in codeine no where near as bad as the others

4351,Currently available RC opiates. Thoughts?,"I've heard certain colored batches of Piperidylthiambutene are inactive. I've seen at at least one post on the subject before.

Also I think PRE-084 is a sigma receptor agonist that's chemically related to PCP.

And O-DSMT is the opioid metabolite of Tramadol so it cuts out having to be a good CYP2D6 metabolizer to get good effects out of it. It's about as strong as Hydrocodone so if you have a tolerance it won't cut it but it's a good alternative for the opioid naive."
4352,Currently available RC opiates. Thoughts?,Is /u/captainfentanyl still around?  He use to have a wealth of knowledge about things like that.
